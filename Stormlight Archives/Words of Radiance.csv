"B00DA6YEKS","5","Gumption and Spit (Or: Well, I'm back. Again.)","Sometime later on in Words of Radiance, during one of the many Interludes that appear between each of the behemoth novel's five sprawling parts, a character named Lift ambles up the side of a castle wall using powers we'll leave here unspecified on her way to steal. Soon thereafter, a boy joins her side and asks her how she managed to scale the wall, as there was no ladder for her to do so, and he himself needed a rope that she lowered down to him. ""Gumption and spit,"" Lift replies, before traipsing onwards towards her destiny. Gumption and spit, indeed. Here is a marvelous combination of things that can result in magical things - even if the final product is a bit messy. Over one year ago, I wrote up my thoughts concerning Brandon Sanderson's entry volume to the Stormlight Archive, ""The Way of Kings"" and had a blast lauding the book, not to mention infuriating fans of Dune everywhere. The Way of Kings was (and is, upon re-reading) one of the best fantasy novels I have ever read - heck, one of the most best books I've ever read, period - and I gave it a 9.5/10 (a 5/5 by Amazon's star system) after desperately pruning it down from the 10/10 I initially wanted to give it by taking off half a point for Kaladin Stormblessed's face palm worthy emo moments and Shallan Davar being...well, herself. In short, The Way of Kings was one of my favorite books of all time, in large part because of the series it promised. So, the question I needed Words of Radiance to answer was, ""Is the series still promising?"" And the answer is ""Yes."" And that's a good, good thing - a relief, even. Following my tradition, the first paragraph of this review is about as closer to a spoiler as I'm going to get - fear not, wary reader. No spoilers follow for Words of Radiance...but if you haven't read the Way of Kings, I'd recommend not going any further than this. I will address subject matter you probably don't want to know. Come on back after you've read the first book and the series, and we'll talk. For the rest of you, we'll go ahead and get the brass tax out of the way up front here - Words of Radiance is a good book. I'd give it an 8.8/10 on my scale, or about a 4.5/5 on Amazon's star scale. Amazon doesn't seem to see the need for half stars in their options, so in an effort to not under-represent this book, I'm marking it as a 5/5. Technically, it's closer to a 4/5, but that 4 star rating just looks bad, doesn't it? Frankly, I don't have the heart to mark Words of Radiance down that far. It is, by all accounts, a better book than its predecessor, and Sanderson has clearly grown as an author, his prose and descriptive power reaching very good levels. So why the negative hullabaloo from the Way of Kings' self-professed biggest fan? Well, I guess it's just because I didn't like this book as much as the first one. Not by a long shot, actually. In fact, so long as we're being honest, I thought parts one and two of Words of Radiance were two of the bleakest, most ""oh my God not Song of Ice and Fire syndrome please Sanderson no"" pages I've ever trudged through. It was, for lack of a better word, a frightening time in my life, having been excited for this book since I first left Roshar so long ago. I had recently returned from a deployment to Afghanistan, and I had more wrapped up in the Stormlight Archive than a simple thirst for entertainment. It was the first book I read upon returning to the States, and there's something...special, maybe, about that. That, and this book series is going to be ten books long. I will grow up with it, in many ways, as will we all. I was pretty frightened that the Way of Kings might have been a fluke, and the nine books that followed it were destined to be more like the middle of the Wheel of Time or the last two iterations of Ice and Fire. Be at peace, readers. Parts 3, 4 and 5 of Words of Radiance are all truly wonderful, and Sanderson seemed to get his mojo back by the time I hit them. The book earns the five star rating I've awarded it, and its because of its moments of sheer brilliance that I find myself disappointed and genuinely baffled by the unnecessary moments of tedium that drag the book as whole down away from its predecessor. Ultimately, the Stormlight Archive is, at the end of Words of Radiance, in very good shape. There are places for it to go, questions for it to answer, battles to be fought and mysteries to be unraveled. That's all that matters, really. This was Shallan's book, and thus the book most of us were most wary of to begin with. She was a frustrating character in the Way of Kings, and in some ways she's even more frustrating here, but for very different reasons. I didn't particularly like her in the first book, and I liked her even less by the end of this one. I can't help but wonder if my relationship with the book was in large part due to my relationship with her. My biggest complaint about Words of Radiance is actually directly connected with its biggest strength. It is a massive tome - a sprawling behemoth of a book, and as a result we get to see more of Roshar than ever before. More of its politics, its mysteries, its religions, its cultures, its landscapes, its magic. Thank God for that, since I love this world and I never want to leave. But Sanderon's pacing here is...well, off. (The witty banter is also painful to read, at times, but it adds to the charm of the characters, in its own weird way.) What I mean about the pacing is this - parts one and two trudge along at a snail's pace, getting bogged down by high prince politicking (that ends up being unimportant come book's end), Shallan lying to herself and to the world, and Kaladin returning to his fantastically emo roots, and Adolin channeling a G-rated Jaime Lannister minus Cersei. Dalinar recedes into the background a bit here, but I don't mind this as much as I thought I would, Jasnah continues to be a great character, Lopen gets funnier, and Shen proves to be more elaborate than he originally seemed. Rock remains a good cook. We see much more of Parshendi culture, learn more about the lost city of Urithuru, and of Taravengian's evil plan to save the world. We learn about the nature of spren early on, and about the nature of shard blades late in the book. Part five of Words of Radiance is arguably the best part of the bunch, and is also the shortest - by a LONG shot - and could have easily been a hundred pages longer. Should have been, I'd venture to say, as the first 90% of the book leads up to the climactic final 10% - but when the revelations finally emerge, they're given maybe a page or two of attention. It startled me. The twists you came to find out - predictable or not - should have been given much, much more space to breathe. I would have loved that. In an effort to counterbalance this paragraph of nay saying, I will say that there are a couple of duels / battles in Words of Radiance that had me smiling like a blithering idiot. Sanderson still knows how to write a fight. Man oh man oh man. So does Words of Radiance reveal too much or too little? Both, I think - Sanderson shows us so much in this book, yet it feels like he's trying to fit in as MUCH as humanly possible into a tiny space, which baffles me, since he just spent a thousand pages building up to those reveals. It was like he lost a little faith in the fact that his world is interesting enough as it is without having to try and elaborate what makes it interesting, and as a result he worked and worked and worked on parts of little consequence, exposing the clues too neatly, and when it came to the parts that really, actually mattered, he was out of both time and space. There was no need to try and recreate the mind breaking ending of the Way of Kings, but I do appreciate the effort to do so. Maybe it'll be something we can expect in every book, a final hundred pages of twists and twists and twists. At best, this could set the Stormlight Archive aside from its contemporaries in wonderful fashion. At worst, Sanderson could...*lowers voice to a conspiratorial whisper* go the way of the Shyamalan. I know, blasphemy. Honestly, though, the Shyamalan effect is the deadliest enemy facing the Stormlight Archive on the whole right now. Hopefully the twists we find in book three of the Stormlight Archive are more satisfying. I wonder, honestly, if Sanderson himself is very aware of the book he has wrought. He's a very perceptive man, and being a professor at Brigham Young University has allowed him to organize his thoughts on writing with the clear efficiency only someone who teaches writing could muster. I cannot help but assume that, post publication, he looks at Words of Radiance the way a professor might. The world of Roshar is still here, still full of surprises, still full of characters who will do things that surprise you. The characters are still (thankfully) themselves, and the magic is still really, really cool. Yet something is lost when we come into this book expecting twists around every corner. It makes the moment when they finally come so much less remarkable - indeed, I actually predicted almost every twist before I ever cracked the book open, and I'm not always very good at that. I wonder, therefore, if part of the reason I didn't enjoy Words of Radiance as much as I had hoped I would is simply because I spent the whole book reading between the lines, searching for assassins in every shadow, for twists in every ambiguous statement. If it's possible for the quality of the book to lie in the reader, then that has been exemplified here. This brings me, at last, to the part of the book that astonished me most. The character of Wit - who I am of the opinion acts almost as an avatar for Sanderson himself in the world of Roshar and Shadesmar - comments on the flaws and nature of the book surrounding him at the end of both the Way of Kings and Words of Radiance. He usually reveals the best twists in the midst of leaning on the fourth wall, and comments on what he perceives to be injustices in the world of art. In the Way of Kings, Wit argues that originality is what humanity values most, and in Words of Radiance, he argues that all art is subject to perspective. ""Give me an audience who have come to be entertained,"" Wit says in the epilogue, ""but who expect nothing special. To them, I will be a god. That is the best truth I know."" Fellow readers, my advice is simple. Go into Words of Radiance looking to be entertained. Don't look for the twists. Looking for the twists is like sneaking a peek at presents the month before Christmas. Just wait, let the day come, and then tear the paper to pieces and scatter it all around, feeling the rush of not knowing what lies within. Sanderson is crafting for us a master series, and has eight more books to present. I for one am breathless for the continuation of the series, and have full faith in the author to turn this series into something very, very special. I'll see you all at the end of book three, which I am already hungry for. And, finally, to Mr. Sanderson himself.  Thank you, sir, for welcoming me home. 8.8/10","2014-03-29","United States","","true","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GY81SK3HT0F"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","Clear, Tight, Radiant Masterpiece","Book 2 Pros: - Amazingly eve better than the first book due to more plot and multiple story line's tie-ups that make for several tight endings. - Doesn't seem like an installment. It could stand on it's own. - Overall Plot is tight, well ordered, timing is metronomic. - Writing is super clear. Reading is a total breeze. - Creativity is in spades. Branderson is a certain master at imagining something new to you that he can describe easily as a picture, understandable the first time you read it. - This book is revealing the magic organization in deeper detail, but hints at more. - This book took the plot of god-metaphysics and created what had seemed contained into a subset. The universe just got larger. - There are multiple parallel plots going on, each switch making you crave and long for a return to the character you just read about. Most writers do this by chapter as he did in the first book, but this book increases the pace by having some chapters of 3 distinct narratives playing round-robin to keep interest and pace. This keeps your interest, but also helps you not lose your place with characters. A comparison is with Martin in that his last book entirely omitted characters, so that someone you read about in Book 4 you won't get to until Book 6 making re-reading necessary for anyone who don'ts have a perfect memory. Maybe that helps him sell more books to be re-read or that cool Apple App, but it's actually quite annoying to the reader. Cons: - Some characters are too cutesy. The personality of the main Spren is too Tinker Bell for my taste. I think it takes what could be a serious and heavy pall over the entire work, giving this fiction a feeling of reality, that is dispelled by such frivolity. - I find some of the characters still 2 dimensional. Some character dialogue are too similar to each other, and example being that I noticed 2 distinct characters having the same exact syntax and verbiage to their sense of humor. This is the only flaw I can find in his writing that can still develop to perfection. Namely, verbal identity to character dialogue that effortlessly makes them seem distinct and real. It's still in some places too stiff and formulaic. It's still his Achille's Heel. - He promises a timely delivery on books, but gets side-tracked by other projects and pushes the dates back. So we are going to be waiting for a loooong, time. Hopefully not Robert Jordan time cause I don't think there is anyone capable of finishing Branderson's books as well or better. Branderson's style is also classical in the sense that it's clean. There isn't modern cable channel gore or sexuality or shock plot for shock's sake to glue the interest of readers. He is a master of plot and doesn't let anything get in the way of keeping the plot moving exactly as he orders it. It's as if he believes good writing and great plot will keep the readers without the cheap literary gimmicks. The timing of his unfolding plot is metronomic and the plot is of such quality, it appears that we not only have a breathtaking masterpiece in the works, but a rare generations output even by his own standards of work. I like some of his other books very much, but this undertaking's internal history is deep and somewhere below Tolkien and above R.R. Martin. Read my first book's review for a comparison between him and Martin and why they are only similar in that they are contemporaries. The first book piqued my curiosity. This book has my interest, ha ha. So he is now my current favorite living fiction author. Bottom line: Superb next step in the series & leaves you pining for Book 3.","2014-04-11","United States","","true","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RX5W338H7GXK2"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","White and Black and Grey.","There are a lot of reasons to love the Stormlight Archive and the two books out. Sanderson has created an imaginitive yet realistic world with dynamic, living, and fascinating characters and cultures. The magic system is vast and complex, yet consistent and fluid. Each chapter he seems to give us answers yet still leave us with a deep sense of wonder - not in the furstrating LOST (the TV show) way, but in a very fulfilling and satisfying way. It reminds me of the wonder we should still have at the 'magic' in our own universe despite knowing how some of it works. Not only is the world enjoyable, the plotline is exciting and detailed. It is deliberate and focused on more than just 'fun action scenes.' There is a real weightiness to these books (literally and metaphorically). You will not be dissapointed with the plot of the Words of Radiance (or the Way of Kings if you haven't read that yet). As I mentioned in my review of the Way of Kings, Sanderson not only creates an exciting and interesting story, but he communicates timeless truths and does so in a way that is enriched by beautiful prose and very touching moments. I've found myself reliving key moments in both books in my mind as they have particularly struck me in their scope and truth. Moments that as I read the books a second time I found myself truly looking forward to and mixed in with a few tears at the sheer power of them. All of that aside, the thing I am most impressed with Sanderson is how he treats the issues of morality in these books. For me, the epitome of fantasy is still the Lord of the Rings. I am enraptured by Middle-Earth and the beautiful truths present. Some people dislike (and I understand why) how 'black and white' Tolkien's characters are. Personally I love my hero to be bold and confident and pure like Aragorn is, but I get why people see that as 'unrealistic.' On the opposite end of the spectrum, Martin's A Tale of Fire and Ice (Game of the Thrones) is very beloved for the opposite reason - it is gritty, realistic, and deterimidly 'grey.' Of course, both of those novels have a touch of the opposite. Smeagol/Gollum, Grima Wormtongue, Boromir and a few other characters touch on that element of 'greyness' in Tolkien. There are characters in A Tale of Fire and Ice that are certainly closer to white or black than grey. Nonetheless, I think they are good examples of opposite ends of the spectrum. Then there's what I love about Sanderson. I don't think we've seen a single character we've seen that is pure white or pure black in Sanderson. Kaladin, the protgaonist, while constantly struggling with what it means to hero, has moments where he is very much on the 'white' side of the spectrum, but certainly isn't perfect. The slaver, Tvlakv, is described as 'A bastard, but a likeable bastard."" So even the 'bad' characters have a touch of light in them. At all, though, Sanderson maintains that while the characters aren't perfect, there still is a pure and white and a pure black at the ends of the spectrum. True, everyone has blemishes and faults, but that doesn't change the fact that there is an ultimately 'good' morality and an ultimately 'bad' morality. A significant emphasis of these novels is the characters struggling to achieve this purity. Recognizing their selfishness and greyness for what it is an combating that. I think it is a fascinating and exilerating combination of the two sepctrums and is part of what truly drives these epic tales. It is found just as much in Words of Radiance as it is in the Way of Kings, if not more. Because of this and all of the other reasons mentioned, I cannot recommend the Words of Radiance highly enough.","2014-05-05","United States","","true","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UL6W97MIQUHC"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","No longer a rising star; but an author close to his zenith...","And Brandon Sanderson is likely to stay there for quite a while. With his fertile imagination, his excellent wordsmithing and his willingness to tackle some thorny topics, I expect this man to be as prolific in fantasy as Isaac Asimov was in science fiction, although I do hope that he takes some time to try his hand more fully at writing science fiction, because with his eye for detail he could write some pretty hard SF and thereby run with the Big Boys in that genre. But on to WOR. The cast of characters remain pretty much centered on Kaladin, Dalinar, Shallan and Szeth. Shallan is on her way to the Shattered Plains when something happens to derail the plans of her guardian, the princess Jasnah. Kaladin has taken over the job of making all those disgruntled and despairing bridgemen into true soldiers, as well as discovering how much he can do with his stormlight. Dalinar is still working to unite all the High Princes under Elhokar and begins this by encouraging his son Adolin to duel the sons of all the other High Princes for the prestige and of course, for their shardblades/plate. And Szeth is terrorizing Roshar by traveling the world and doing a very good job of leaving the governments of the world headless. In the midst of all this we get to know a bit more about the Parshendi and their former gods. We get to know a bit more about two particular Parshendi, the warleader of the Parshendi and Rlain, who finally is accepted without constraint as one of Kaladin's bridgemen. We also learn more about the StormFather, the Almighty, and of Kaladin's Syl. Of course there are plenty of applecart upsettings; for example when Amaram appears (the brighteyes who betrayed Kaladin and sold him into slavery) and when we find out that Jasnah was not the only one who feared that the void bringers were going to return. We also dig deeper into Shallan's past and wow! How did she survive such a dismal existence? And of course there are several interludes where characters make cameo appearances, perhaps setting us up for the next book. There's 1080 pages of spin-you-about-and-turn-you-upside-down in this book and its hard not to drop spoilers like rain in a highstorm, but I am not going to succumb. Suffice it to say that some grow, some receive their just desserts, some learn secrets of the universe and some accept new mantles of leadership. There are even a few who unexpectedly return from the dead and surprise us either not at all or enough to drop your jaw, depending upon your level of cynicism. And we find out that Wit has got to be more than just a man, though that revelation does not come until the epilogue, and what he is, is hard to say. And why I say that, well, that would be spoiling. As Robert Jordan used to say, RAFO. Should you get this book? Only if you have read the previous one. Too much that happens in this book depends on what happened in the last book. It cannot stand alone. But if you have read the first book, as hard as it was on your psyche, then you absolutely must get the next book. This one is much faster moving, nowhere near as hard on the readers or characters, and has so many surprises in it that the reader will become dizzy at their rapid appearance. And besides, this is just plain good literature. As for me, I have the hard copy and the Kindle version. I intend to get the Audible version to complete the set. This is one thrilling story and I cannot wait until the next volume comes out. BTW, does anyone know how many books Sanderson plans to write in this series? I have a boss who is threatening me with the loss of a paycheck if I cannot find out that information. It's my own fault, I guess. I got him addicted to this series.

"B00DA6YEKS","4","The beauty of this story is in the details","This is a huge, meaty, fantasy novel for lovers of fantasy novels. I have a habit of diving into books and forgetting to come up for air. The bigger a book is, the longer I can immerse myself, so the size of this >1000 page novel is a high point for me. It took me three days of solid reading to get through it, during which I pretty much only stopped to feed myself and walk the dog. There are some people who say they managed it in one sitting, and I am stupefied by the sheer amount of posterior fortitude that must have taken. The story is vast, encompassing hordes of characters, side plots, and rich with details and hints that allow the reader to puzzle and theorize about how everything fits together. The world itself that the story is set in continues to be unlike any other world I've read about in fantasy, with a well thought out history and unique ecosystem that are important to the plot. There are a lot of answers given to questions raised in the first book that lead to a lot of wonderful AHA! and I KNEW IT! and SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT COMING WHY DIDN'T I SEE IT? moments. One of the things I love about Sandersons books is that the magic systems are very detailed and practical. Instead of , ""It's magic, DUH."" there are logical explanations and rules which fit within the context of the story, and you can be sure that every angle and possibility has been considered and will probably be addressed eventually if it hasn't been already. In short, it's written by a geek for geeks, and the plot will hold up to scrutiny. Everything from the technology to the philosophy, at least from my inexpert point of view. I've heard some complaints about the side stories and characters being unnecessary, but I think half the fun is trying to figure out how they fit in to the overarching story line. It's a ten book series, people. There are still a lot of mysteries left, and we get to guess and wonder in the meantime. There are hints. Once again, this is obsessive geek territory, and that's not a bad thing. There are obvious plot twists and shocking ones, and Kalladin is emo but heroic, and Dalinar gets his groove back and Shallan is given more depth and we get to see inside the parshendi culture. It's better to just read it. I won't get into the plot details. I took off one star for a few issues I have that may be just because I am an irritable person. It might just be me and my curmudgeonly view on life, but this is my review, so be it. Here they are: (warning: rant follows) 1)STOP USING THE WORD 'TAD'. It's not a good word in the modern vernacular, and it has no business in a quasi-medieval fantasy novel. I understand that there are artistic licenses with dialog, and I'm even being forgiving of the use of 'awesomeness', because for me it wasn't nearly as jarring as 'tad'. Every time I read it I was completely thrown out of the story. Tad. REALLY? 2) I WOULD RATHER LISTEN TO A DOZEN NAZIS FILING THEIR NAILS ON CHALKBOARDS THAN HAVE TO READ ANY MORE WORDPLAY Half of the characters imagine themselves to be very clever. They call themselves clever repeatedly, and so does everyone else. They're not. They're obnoxious. There are some genuinely funny moments in the vast tome I just read, but the dialogue, it does not scintillate. There are some moments, if someone had picked Shallan up and tossed her into the jaws of the nearest chasm fiend I would have considered it a job well done. Apparently on Roshar, the height of incisive ridicule is to call someone stinky. (I'm looking at you, Shallan, Sebelius, Kalladin, Wit and Adolin. Yes, every single one.) During the painful banter sessions I'm reminded of a bunch of dweebs giggling at their own smug cleverness. (Not that there's anything wrong with dweebs. I fall into that category myself, but I don't think that's what the author was going for, and there's so MUCH of it!) It doesn't help that Wit, who's name is descriptive of his JOB for chrissake, has speech patterns eerily similar to the comic book store guy from The Simpsons. Behold: ""It's also hilarious on people who aren't deaf, OBVIOUSLY. What, you think I'd torment someone just because they're deaf? That would be immoral. No, I torment all people equally, THANK YOU VERY MUCH."" (Emphasis mine. I can't not read it that way. I can't un-hear it.) 3) NIGHTBLOOD Why did Brandon Sanderson bring that awful talking sword cartoon character into this story? WHY?? It was the worst part of Warbreaker and now it's a crossover! It's a TALKING SWORD. Aaargh! Get off my lawn! Other than those three issues I loved this book. LOVED it. I'm going to read it again to catch anything I might have missed, because I'm already going through the separation anxiety that comes from finishing a good book. I can't wait for the next one.","2014-03-11","United States","","true","5","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R232HS3ETHVUG7"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","Absolutely brilliant","This was amazing! You were all right! I have no words in me to review this book, but it certainly was radiant. Every time I think I can’t possibly become more impressed with Sanderson, I find out I was wrong. He is brilliant, and I am in awe with what he is achieving with Cosmere as a whole. I love that Sanderson leaves enough clues for us to guess little pieces of story, but it never compromises our satisfaction, because there is always something more. It just makes me feel smart, while You can always be sure <i>“there is always another secret”</i>! What an emotional roller coaster! This was fantasy perfection! The world building is amazing, the magic system intricate, and the characters are complex, flawed and profound, and they never read as the typical fantasy heroes. The way Sanderson writes his characters just feels different. He explores something in them in a deep level, but then you see another layer, and get to explore it on a deep level as well. Sometimes you like the first layer and relate to the character immediately, sometimes you need to see more of them, and go deep into another piece of their soul. Words of Radiance was stellar in exploring more layers of SA characters and, at this point, I’m invested in all of them (and I hated several in WoK). This is a very long book, but everything on it feels necessary, and I wouldn’t change a thing. Having everyone together, and several POV in the same chapter increased the pace of the story, and left me hanging on every written word. I wanted to scream every time I reached the interludes, but I loved all of them, and what they add to the story. Shallan’s humor was a great addition to the story, bringing a new light to it. It was certainly needed to balance Kaladin moods. I expect she will change a bit with the admission of the past, but I hope she gets to keep at least a bit of her older self. I loved the duels, the chasms, the storms, bridge four, discovering Adolin’s heart and Taravangian brain, the fights and, as usual, Hoid. <i><b> Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination. I will protect those who cannot protect themselves. I will protect even those I hate so long as it is right.</i></b> <b>Side note</b>: for everyone who says it is necessary to read Warbreaker before this book… I honestly don’t think it is. It’s a nice Easter egg, but it doesn’t really impact the story (yet?). I was actually disappointed because I was expecting more of that particular character. Read Warbreaker because it is great, because you love Cosmere, because it is an easy entry to the Cosmere or because you want to read Sanderson without the commitment of a whole series. Stormlight Archives is already a huge commitment with 4 ginormous books, 2 “novellas”, and more than half of it yet to be published.

"B00DA6YEKS","3","The plodding continues...","So if the Way of Kings plodded on a bit, at least it had Kaladin's struggle through being a bridgeman to keep it interesting. In Words of Radiance, the plodding never really ends. It's interrupted with interesting bits now and again, and some of those interesting bits are really very good and very engaging. But before long, we're back to plodding, terrible dialogue, cardboard characters, and tensionless scenes of bugger all happening. I'll dive in and explore why this one left much to be desired for me. <b>Technical Aspects</b> Sanderson's strength has never been the technical aspect of his writing. Now, that's certainly not an unforgivable sin. It is possible to have a compelling narrative with less-than-stellar writing, and technicality is not the soul of good fictino. But here, with such a long, drawn-out epic, the story just drags oftentimes and Sanderson's lackluster prose doesn't do much to liven things up between the bits of the story that actually matter, which seem few and far between as one wades through seemingly endless bland conversations and activities that might end up giving one or two small pieces of information that contribute toward the eventual meanderings of the plot or character development, but mostly just seem like filler...which this book certainly doesn't need. His dialogue is hit or miss. I'll address this more later, but he CANNOT write witty banter, which is unfortunate...because I swear that half of the dialogue in this book, especially for some characters is <i>nothing</i> but ""witty"" banter. It just ends up coming across as dialogue that would perhaps be fitting between two eight-year-olds, but not between full-grown adults. I'll talk about that more in the Characters section. His descriptions continue to be adequate but not spellbinding for the most part. We get the picture of the world well enough, though it does come across pretty generically in my mind. This series seems to have this thin layer of originality on the surface, but it ends up just coming out as a generic fantasy mishmash in my mind, at least from a visual point of view. I do like his Stormlight magic system and the order of the Knights Radiant (even if they're basicaly just Jedi knights), as well as some aspects of the spren and other god-like beings. The politics and human civilizations though are pretty bland, with pompous lords and dissatisfied peasants and armor and swords and battles and a distinctly almost-human OTHER to fight. Not that everything has to be original. I'm just saying that I don't find that many aspects of this series new and interesting in terms of setting/cultures/worldbuilding, with a few notable exceptions as I mentioned. Some of the language used both for narrative and dialogue seems anachronistic or just out of place for the world we're in. Words like ""awesome"" (as used by a very annoying 13-year-old...I'll get to her later) just don't fit in with the epic fantasy setting we're in. Most of what actually IS interesting in this book (and there are some things) comes from what happens in the plot, not from technical prowess or good dialogue, with a few notable exceptions, such as some of Dalinar's conversations with Kaladin. All that said, the technical part of the writing isn't horrific. It's functional but not something you'll remember. <b>Story</b> Now, I don't want to judge story or plot too harshly because it's a very subjective thing but I'll put in my two cents about a few things at least. One thing I really want to gripe about is the lack of any overarching conflict aside from that between nature and man. There are sort of accessory villains, each wanting to influence events in the world for their own ends, but none of them are really explored that much and there are so many different groups that it's hard to remember who wants to do what. In the end, it's really the storms that are the great threat to mankind. In the first book, Sadeus was the big villain and I thought that was much more compelling. He seemed like a friend at first, if an uneasy one, and eventually everything led up to his big betrayal. That genuinely came as a shock! In this though...well...there's nothing really like that. The Parshendi are the bad guys and they stay the bad guys. They're not even <i>in</i> most of the book though, so the tension can't come from them and there's not really anyone else for it to come from except here and there scattered throughout the jumbled mess of plotlines. Fiction, especially epic fantasy, <i>is</i> conflict after all. The Parshendi are there too, as I said, but it's unclear why they want what they want. We found in the last book that they assassinated Gavilar, the king of the Alethi and so they kind of become resigned to their fate as the prey of the Alethi as they are hunted on the Shattered plains until they suddenly decide that the Alethi are actually the bad guys...because they wanted to bring back the Parshendi gods or keep them from being brought back or...something...it's not really clear. In fact, <spoiler>Eshonai's entire plotline is literally pointless. Nothing we need to know comes out of it that couldn't have been supplied by Rlain in the end anyway and her decision to kill off half the population makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. And then she dies, along with all her other Stormform brethren! Pointless! We didn't even really get to see that much of what they can do!</spoiler>. There are a lot of pointless little plot things here and there, as I've said. There's a scene (this isn't a spoiler at all) where Dalinar and company are going to meet the Parshendi out on the plateaus to discuss something. Adolin insists on going in his father's place and posing as Dalinar during the meeting while Dalinar tells him what to say via spanreed. Why? No reason...just no reason at all. They suspect assassins might take the opportunity to strike, but that's never really stopped Dalinar before and this meeting is pretty darn important. Also, NOTHING ends up happening anyway so it's not even justified from a narrative perspective. It seems like an attempt to add drama when it really isn't called for at all and I'd rather just see the story progress. That'a just one example of many. Now, as I said, I could forgive a lot when it comes to story/plot if the characters are interesting and compelling. After all, characters and how they deal with their conflicts are what really drive compelling stories. Characters are what saved The Way of Kings for me after all (Well, Kaladin at least). Did they (he) save this one for me? Well...erm.... <b>Characters</b> No. No they did not. I mean, they weren't terrible. I still gave the book three out of five stars because I do still relate somewhat with a few of them and I genuinely wanted to see what happened to them. It wasn't always a hate-read for me, mostly because I do like some of the characters, mostly Kaladin, Shallan, and Dalinar. That said, they were still pretty weak for the most part. I'll go through each of the major ones. <i>Kaladin</i> Kaladin was my favorite character of the last book. His struggle to unite his bridgeman companions and free them all from their oppression while discovering arcane powers was genuinely captivating at times. Aided by pretty great flashbacks to his younger days with his family at home and the events that led to his enslavement, his story sold the book to me even though the other characters had the personality of cement. He had a great arc, a compelling (if a bit cliché) personality, and genuine conflict to fight against. As this book starts though, he already has all that he wants. He's in a really great place as Dalinar's bodyguard and his men are all taken care of and free. He quickly devolves into a moaning child and stays that way through most of the book. The colorful characters that accompanied him last time (like Rock, Teft, Sigzel, etc.) play a much more minor role and Kaladin has to cary this one by himself, which he kind of fails to do. He discovers more powers and masters them pretty effortlessly (boring). The only real arc he has relates to one of his bridgemen and the king. This is a great subplot and I won't spoil it, but Kaladin learns some humility and also learns that the duty to protect extends farther than he thought. It's not perfect, but it was a good aside from the bunch of nothing he was doing before. All in all, Kaladin comes across as a big pout in this book. Uninteresting, petty, and tortured by his inner demons, which also aren't that interesting. <i>Adolin</i> Mr. Boring McBlandypants himself. Comes across as a too-perfect idiot who is obviously just there for Shallan to fall in love with before she realizes that Kaladin is the one for her. That's not even a spoiler because it doesn't happen in this book but I just know it will...Next <i>Shallan</i> Shallan was boring in the last book...and she still is, but at least she's DOING something in this one. The beginning is just awesome for her but then quickly devolves into boringland again once she reaches the plains. Sanderson tries way too hard to make her witty and quirky but it just backfires and makes her really annoying. If that was the intention then it was effective...but not in a good way. Maybe it's supposed to be in her character that she's really bad at making witty jibes at people, but if that's the case then why do they actually seem hurt by her comments or jokes at times? There are only so many times a ""your mom"" or ""your face"" type of joke is funny...and that's not that many times. But that's basically the extent of her wit; ""your mom"" and ""your face"" jokes, as in Kaladin: ""Ah, that chasmfiend is retreating!"" Shallan: ""It was probably your unfortunate face that did the job"" Kaladin: ""Well your mother probably looks even worse..."" No, that's not an actual excerpt but I wouldn't have been surprised if it had. It's that bad at times. There's also an odd moment or two when Shallan reacts very strongly and negatively to the suggestion that she needs to be protected. That was never really set up and comes out of nowhere, supposedly based on her history of being sequestered away by her father. Still, it feels random and out of nowhere and way too strong. I do really like Pattern for the most part, even though he too has some dumb lines. Shallan discovers her powers pretty easily as well and has a lot of subplots relating to the ghostbloods that just kind of go on and on without paying off. We do find out the big reveal about Shallan's past, but it's a huge letdown as we've already put the pieces together for ourselves at that point. Her flashback scenes are actually quite excellent though and old Shallan is way more interesting than present times Shallan. She had more of a conflict in the years leading up to the main story and the events that take place with her brothers and father are far more interesting than what she's doing with the ghostbloods or in her attempts to find the Oathgate. It's a good example of how small, character-based moments are far more interesting than overblown, epically fantastical things in the world without emotional engagement. <i>Dalinar</i> Dalinar is kind of the same bland soldier he was in the first book. I like some of his conversations with Kaladin and how he acts as a bit of a foster father to him, but I wish there was more of that. Most of his time is spent being gruffly speculative. <b>Summary</b> This isn't a bad book. It's just not for me. I like every scene and every chapter in a book to serve the overall plot while giving their exposition and character development. That is certainly not the case in this book. This book has plot threads and character stories weaving all over the place, not always moving the story forward. I like dialogue to feel real and in the vein of the world we're in. Lift talking about all her ""awesomeness"" and stuff like that really takes me out of a story. Lift, by the way, was really annoying. Anyone who has read the book knows who I'm talking about. Anyway, if you were a big fan of the first one, you'll probably like this one too. I read this one begrudgingly because I like the first one more than I hated it. I think Sanderson may just not be up my alley. He seems like a perfectly nice guy from interviews and I enjoy his lectures. He's not even a bad writer. Just not for me. I'll probably end up reading more of his work, but I'll be taking a break for a while.","2015-01-05","United States","","true","9","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4LQPYVA7QD0D"

"B00DA6YEKS","3","Far Too Much Journey Before Destination","The first book was a trip. In the beginning it was fairly exciting, and the world-building and characterization was enough that I felt satisfied and intrigued. After a few hundred pages however, all the narrative force seemed to disappear and reading it became an endless slog of unnecessary filler pulling me along at the speed of a chull. It was tough to get through, but I was spurred on by a number of reviews claiming that it became better toward the end. It did become better, a lot better, and the last few hundred pages were exciting enough to make me want to buy the next book. But it’s happening again… I’ve reached the 300 page mark and I’m bored to tears. Words of Radiance is not badly written, nor is it infuriating, mindless, or offensive. That being said, whoever edited this book needs to go back to school. It almost feels as if there is no editor at all. Aside from infrequent grammatical errors, some chapters seem entirely void of direction or purpose, wasting a dozen pages to drop a line or clue that could’ve been better covered in a single line of flashback or exposition. And in case the first book wasn’t boring enough, he’s actually recycling ideas from it so you can experience them all over again in their glorious mundanity. **MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD** Remember in the first book when Kaladin was enslaved at the beginning, and spends a few chapters sitting in a box, being pulled along by giant hermit crabs? Remember how you just wanted them to get on with it, and arrive at their destination, so the story could finally start? Well, you get to experience that again, this time with Shallan. The wagons are the same, the setting is the same, and even the slaver Tvlakv (I’ll get to the names later) is exactly the same. And even LESS happens this time. In one chapter, Shallan exits the wagon, sits next to a fire, and then confronts Tvlakv about a decision while accidentally sucking in some stormlight. Then she goes back to the wagon. That’s it. It takes seven pages to learn absolutely nothing new. An editor might look at this and think “Gee, the only thing important here is that she sucked in some stormlight. Perhaps this could be covered as flashback later while something meaningful or interesting is happening,” but no. This isn’t an isolated incident, either. There’s another chapter after this, where Kaladin is walking around a practice yard, idly musing over things, before Dalinar’s sons arrive to choose Renarin’s new fencing master. A new character is introduced and then walks away. Then Syl acts like an annoying child. Close scene. 14 pages. Why can’t this be covered later? Perhaps some conversation where Dalinar states “Oh hey, Renarin got a new fencing master. He’s kind of a badass.” It could convey the same information and not waste the reader’s time. I don’t mind long books. I actually prefer them because I like to be sucked into a world and become immersed. But I don’t like to read empty words that do not further the plot, enliven a character, introduce the reader to fresh concepts, or expand upon a concept. And about the characters...I’m really starting to hate them. Dalinar is worried that someone is going to kill him and his family, so his solution is to give away his armor to his son, fire all the faithful guards that have been serving him for years, and appoint an unknown former slave as their new commander? Are you kidding me? And then you’re going to give this same unknown dude 2,000 soldiers to train and promote him past what should even be possible for a dark-eyes? If I was one of Dalinar’s soldiers, even I would want to assassinate him after that. Meanwhile, Kaladin falls back into soldier mode and becomes the best bodyguard ever, despite carrying a spear indoors (6 ft long weapons aren’t very effective when there are things like furniture and doors and walls to think about), and constantly having to deal with the stick stuck up his butt. His motivation now seems to be revenge on Amaram, but it feels forced, just like all his dialogue explaining why he hates light eyes. He just seems too smart to believe in all the petty grudges he seems to be driven by. Other characters don’t seem to be so vexing, if only I could figure out how to pronounce their names. Szeth, Tvlakv, Vstim, Rysn, Kylrm...JUST STOP. I don’t mind cool-sounding or complex names, but simply deleting most of the vowels until normal pronunciation is impossible is just bad writing. Not only is it immersion breaking, forcing a reader to deconstruct the word and try to figure out how to say it before moving on, but it also pulls a reader’s attention away from the characters themselves. Take Kylrm, for instance. As I’m writing this, I have no recollection of who he even is. I remember reading his name in both books, but so little thought has been assigned to making him real, aside from his impossible pronunciation, that I don’t remember why he exists, what his job is, or whether or not he’s even male or female. The whole trader plotline feels like this, as they’re so outnumbered by the Kaladin/Dalinar/Shallan plotlines as to seem shallow and slow. The last thing I’ll gripe about is that his female characters: Shallan, Eshonai, and Rysn, all feel exactly the same. When Rysn is challenged by a trader in an early chapter, she tries to act strong while feeling meek and unprepared, and eventually succeeds by doing something brave and foolhardy. It was exactly like Shallan would have done, right down to the insecurity, except that this one was on the back of a big turtle. In any case, the story isn’t all bad, and I want to know what’ll happen next, but it’s a real struggle to continue as much of what I’ve recently read seems to be focused on nothing more than getting me to the next chapter, wherein a lot more nothing happens. And I was lying...I have another complaint. The whole system of war in these books makes no sense. Neither army seems to be occupied with defeating the other, but rather likes to race them to giant chrysallises woven by crabmonsters, to cut out it’s heart...and for what? Why do people want these gemhearts? It is said that they’re worth a lot of money, but how or why? And this reason seems to be essentially silly because waging war is possibly the most expensive thing a country can do. So they’re spending vast amounts of wealth to camp along some frontier so they can possibly win some more wealth? Doesn’t this sound stupid to anyone else? And the Parshendi seem ever more confused. Eshonai seems to believe that Gavilar needed to be killed, to prevent the return of something not mentioned yet. But the result of that choice has ended in them being destroyed in the thousands and practically hunted to extinction. Wouldn’t it have been easier to talk to them about it? If they were trying to prevent widespread destruction and death, then why call down the thunder by assassinating the most powerful man in Roshar and then ADMITTING TO IT? They seem to an honorable race of people however, driven by honor even with their respect towards their own dead, and this is why they like to focus fire on the half-naked unarmed enemies carrying bridges instead of the actual soldiers? And why the hell couldn’t the bridge crews have shields? The reason given was that the Parshendi would only fire at the bridgemen if they were unarmored and the troops would be spared because bridgemen would be dying instead. I’m sorry, but this is so contrived as to be completely unbelievable. The bridgemen were the only way that the assault could happen, so they would be fired upon either way. If you actually gave them shields at bare minimum expense, than you wouldn’t have to replace them all each run and they would become more efficient. It’s like the commanders purposely sacrificed efficiency just so Kaladin could whine about how terrible his life is for 800 pages… And what’s up with these gems? How does it make sense to use little crystals, wrapped in glass bubbles for currency? Everyone has to carry around a sack of marbles instead of flat, stackable, easily countable coins or bills? What? And I don’t even know what to say about the spren. It’s just such a weird and nonsensical part of the first novel but I was willing to put it aside as some overly inventive world-building. In this book though, the spren are center stage. All the major characters start getting their own spren that they carry around and talk to like their own personal Picachus. Why the hell are these weird worm-like “things,” that are never fully described, ignored by most of the populace? And they have their own world now? Upon a sea of bead-like water, where every object has it’s own spren, like souls for inanimate objects? It’s just...weird...and feels inorganic. So, in any case, what I’ve read of this book - the first three hundred pages - gets three stars. It’s passably entertaining, contains some cool concepts, and the prose is easy to read and understand. But it is a long and boring read with no focus on trimming extraneous details or tightening the compelling parts of the narrative. It seems like a group of somewhat interesting characters sitting around, shuffling their feet, occasionally engaging in cringe-worthy dialogue, and waiting for something to happen. Well, I’ve waited, and after 1500 pages, I no longer care. I’m not prepared to wait another 500 pages to get to the interesting parts. The book itself should be the interesting parts. It’s not bad, but it’s not great either. It’s moderately, passably good.

"B00DA6YEKS","4","Excellent. Even better than its predecessor.","I struggle a bit with what to say about a 1,080-page book that took me a month and a half to read. That it took me so long is not a negative comment on the book so much as it is a reflection of the reality that life's other pressures often get in the way of reading. I read ""The Way of Kings"" back in January 2011 (the first book I read on a Kindle, and as with my review of that book, I will conclude this one with a particular Kindle-related comment). I found ""Words of Radiance"" to move at a faster clip than ""The Way of Kings"" and to overcome Brandon Sanderson's self-admitted tendency for his books to take a couple of hundred pages to get moving. The last several chapters of ""Words of Radiance"" are as gripping as anything I've read in several years. Not as frenzied a pace as the 100+-page chapter of ""A Memory of Light"" narrating Tarmon Gai'don, mind you, but then that sequence was the summation of a 14-book series as opposed to the conclusion of the second of a projected ten books. I enjoy that the characters in this series are not perfect. I find it unrealistic when a character is too perfect or doesn't make mistakes or the like. In this volume, that imperfection is the source of some level of agony, especially when the reader understands what the characters are doing wrong. I suspect this imperfection may be a particularly significant source of problems and tension for the characters going forward, though I also know Sanderson loves to throw in plot twists (meaning my guess may be 100% wrong). I have only one hesitation in recommending this series to new readers: Pace of publication. The first volume came out in 2010 and the second in 2014. I recognize there were extenuating circumstances there because of Sanderson's commitment to finish the Wheel of Time and the massive amount of time that effort required, so I hope the third volume will be published more quickly (I've seen rumours of spring 2016). You have to recognize this is planned to be a ten-book series, so it's going to be a long time before it's finished. My impression, based on some of Sanderson's comments and interviews, is that he has a pretty firm idea of where he wants this series to go, so I am optimistic the pace of publishing won't be glacial, but I've also seen how some other authors (George R.R. Martin and Kristen Britain come immediately to mind) go several years in between books. I raise all of this because the Stormlight Archive is a complex story to the point where after a few years' delay between books it becomes necessary to go back and refresh yourself a bit on the previous volume. If you're the type of person who hates long waits between books, or who doesn't like to go back and refresh yourself, you may want to wait a few more years before beginning this series (however, be aware that because there are eight more books planned, you could be waiting a long time). Regarding reading this book on a Kindle, in my review of ""The Way of Kings"" I made a comment about how the Kindle is not well-suited to displaying the artwork that appears throughout this book and about how the Kindle is utterly inadequate when it comes to displaying the world map. The same is still true three years later. The following is a re-written version of my prior comments with some updated thoughts: ""I would have given this book five stars, but I took off a point for the Kindle edition because I found the maps and illustrations extremely hard to read (in some cases, almost impossible). I would have liked to have studied the map of Roshar in detail, but the Kindle simply doesn't allow you to zoom in enough to do this in the level of detail I'd prefer to do. There is also some artwork throughout the book that contains text annotations. From having read Brandon Sanderson's other books, I strongly believe that artwork can be expository, but if you read the book on the Kindle, as I did, don't expect much in terms of the artwork. The inability to zoom and move around the images seems to be a limitation of the Kindle. As a workaround, I tried downloading this book into the Kindle app on my iPad since that DOES allow zooming and panning, but it didn't solve the problem because it simply made the images too grainy. ""I think on the whole the illustrations aren't a huge issue and so I'd probably take off half a point, but Amazon does not allow half-star values in rating books. Therefore, I gave four stars because I didn't think it was right to give five when I thought there was a negative that bore mention. I don't want any potential Kindle reader to get put off by my comments about the illustrations. It's still well worth the read, and it's beyond dispute that reading a 1000+ page hardback is a lot easier when you read it as an e-book compared to hauling a hardback around everywhere you go."" If someone who works with or for Brandon Sanderson or his publisher is reading these reviews, I'd like to suggest the map and illustrations be made available on Sanderson's website, perhaps behind a page with spoiler warnings if you think that appropriate. It would be a help to those of us who buy the e-book release. EDITED TO ADD: A comment left in response to this review states the maps and illustrations are indeed on Brandon Sanderson's website. I have not yet looked at them, but it's good information to have. It's still too bad the Kindle can't handle this sort of thing better, but since that's a device-specific limitation, I applaud Sanderson and his publisher for providing this workaround.","2014-04-24","United States","","true","20","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHBHDOJDVNLYJ"

"B00DA6YEKS","5","Words of Radiance is fantastic, and almost anthropological at points, in its scope.","At this point, Words of Radiance has been out for a year and a half, and I suspect most of Sanderson's fans have read it. I've bumped into them at cons, book stores, signings, and, frankly, almost every other place where you might find readers. I bump into them at the most unlikely of places and find them in the people I would least have suspected of being fantasy fans. In fact, for a lot of them, this is the only fantasy that they read--indeed, to them, fantasy IS Brandon Sanderson. There are a lot of explanations for this, but the simplest one is really this: Sanderson writes some pretty awesome stuff. Broad appeal, female protagonists, good writing, high productivity, the absence of foul language and ""on-screen"" sex, and highly creative world building are all parts of that, but really, Sanderson has a formula that instead of being predictable focuses on storytelling fundamentals and innovative plot, character, and world-building... But enough rambling: let's get to Word of Radiance. It merits its own dose of praise. When the first book in The Stormlight Archive was released (The Way of Kings) back in 2010, I found myself waiting at a midnight release to get Sanderson's signature--and yes, I still shake my head that I did it, but I digress--he had just finished the last three books in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. While I agreed with most readers that Sanderson's touch had actually improved the Wheel of Time, I wanted assurance that I wouldn't have to wait a generation to see the end of the next epic fantasy series I would start, of which Sanderson was at that moment signing the first installment in front of me at the table. ""There will be ten books,"" he said. ""And I promise not to die on the way."" All of this is just to say that after finishing #2 in the series I am more than even after the first eager to read the next. And I would read as many as Sanderson writes, be they a thousand pages or more... Words of Radiance surpasses The Way of Kings and sets a path for the series that hints at as much, or more, as it actually reveals. As Words of Radiance opens, our two heroes--Kaladin and Shallan--find themselves moving towards a purpose, having over come the obstacles that they surpassed in The Way of Kings. Kaladin is no longer a slave, but wields the power of the Knights Radiant, if secretly from all but a few of his closest soldiers of the newly formed military unit he heads in their task to protect the King. Shallan finds herself en route to the Alethkar war camp on the Shattered Plains, learning but slowly to recognize her own growing powers. And yet, neither will foresee what they must do--what they must become--if they are to survive the coming storm, as well as the treachery that awaits at every turn. Meanwhile, the mysterious Assassin continues to spread chaos across the land, killing heads of state across the continent, commanded by an unseen hand, a shadow power manipulating the nations. Sanderson has learned how to develop his characters, good and evil, and to make them hurt in a way that accrues sympathy from the reader. For example, it's hard to see Kaladin's choices, watch him pay the price, and see how he digs himself out of the results. Yet Sanderson finds a way, proving that he is in command of the story, not the other way around. At a thousand plus pages, building one character might seem easy, but he does it with every character who earns any time on the pages, even during one of the shorter interludes that fill the gaps between sections, both with color and hints of what is going on across the continent beyond where our main story is happening. Every character is individual, creatively rendered, and vibrantly alive. Just when I think Sanderson couldn't possibly make Roshar more real, he creates another culture, unique and colorful, and adds another layer to what is also a highly developed interplay of characters, countries, cultures, and mythologies. It's a 'wow' factor that makes Sanderson's writing--already carrying a strong story--that much more gripping and hard to put down. Words of Radiance is fantastic, and almost anthropological at points, in its scope. I can't wait to read Oathbringer (hinted for a 2017 release, which is so far away as to be almost a depressing thought), as well as anything that Sanderson manages to punch out in the intervening time between his finishing writing and the publisher's release to shelves.","2015-12-28","United States","","true","23","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SFIC51854CME"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","Quite possibly the PERFECT sequel.","Wow. I don't know where to even start with this one. Admittedly, though Brandon Sanderson is my favorite author, I wasn't the biggest fan of The Way of Kings, the first book of the Stormlight Archives. I mean, the story was good and the world was interesting, but for some reason it did not hook me the way his other books had. Now, with Words of Radiance, I may have a new favorite fantasy novel(and optimistically, new fantasy series). Words of Radiance mainly continues the storylines of the major characters from Way of Kings - Kaladin, Shallan, Jasnah, Dalinar, Adolin, and Szeth, the assassin in white. The way that these characters eventually come together is nothing short of genius, culminating in an ending that the word ""epic"" doesn't seem to begin to cover. Basically, what Way of Kings made me think this series was ultimately building towards served only as the climax of book two. Out of a planned ten. Yeah. The world in the Stormlight Archives is rich, unique, and awe inspiring. Sanderson has crafted a world which has been shaped by violent storms called highstorms. All facets of life and the evolution of plants, animals, and humans are tied to the deadly power of these forces of nature. It may be cliche to speak of the world within a fantasy book being a character in itself, but that truly applies here. I cannot imagine the amount of work Sanderson put into crafting the adaptation of life to live in this storm-torn existence. The magic in this world, powered by stormlight(basically an energy that originates in the highstorms) is complex and creative, a Sanderson staple. There are enough interweaving plots to potentially tie your brain into knots, yet Sanderson pulls them off deftly, throwing twists and surprising revelations at the reader left and right. Even predictable plot points are given an injection of Sanderson ingenuity. And never do these twists feel as if they exist to further the story or to simply throw off the reader. Each is crucial to the story, and completely believable in the context of the story. I know I'm a little biased in this regard(as I've mentioned, Sanderson is my favorite author), but he has really outdone himself with the story this time. The characters all possess an amazing amount of depth(Sanderson seems to have evolved past the criticism of having two-dimensional characters in his prior works . . . maybe an effect from finishing Roobert Jordan's Wheel of Time series). Every main character is wholly believable(in a swords and sorcery fantasy sense), each with their own personal demons and motivations. Not one of the dozens of main and side characters blend in with another. Each is unique and interesting. The action in this book, as with any Sanderson book, is exciting, fast-paced, and brilliant in its creativity. Now, I know I haven't said much about the plot, and I don't feel I can without giving more than I'd like away. Instead, I'd like to express that this is an AMAZING epic fantasy novel. The hardback version is over a thousand pages(I read that it's the biggest book published by TOR page wise . . . not 100% sure if that's true)and 300K+ words, yet it reads like a book a quarter of its size, keeping you glued to the pages from the first to the last with little to no filler. Some of the biggest names in epic fantasy(Tolkien, Jordan, Martin) are/were unable to pull off such a feat. When I finished the last page, I wasn't ready to put down the book. I wanted more, so much so that I found myself actually hating the thought of the series coming to an end 8 books from now. Yeah, I enjoyed it that much. I can't remember the last time I was this satisfied with a book in a series. The end is still stuck in my head as I write this, and probably will be until book 3 is released a year or more from now. Again, I know I have a bit of a Sanderson bias, but I still feel that this is a book that needs to be read by any fan of epic fantasy. Heck, just fantasy. I do not recommend going into it without reading Way of Kings, but know that if you even sort of enjoy Way of Kings, I guarantee you'll LOVE Words of Radiance.","2014-04-04","United States","","true","24","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R547I0P3FYMM"

"B00DA6YEKS","5","This is my favourite fantasy series (so far)","This is my favourite fantasy series (so far). I feel like it delivers on every aspect and I'm really impressed with Brandon Sanderson as an author. Having read a huge amount of recent and older fantasy, I was surprised how fresh this seemed while stille being true to the genre. Hit the ground running One of the thing that worked really well for me, is that you get thrown into the middle without any explanation of the world and its rules - which are spectacular. Normally I hate it when I have to keep track of too many things and names and don't get it fed in spoons - but everything is so well arranged, exciting and falls so nicely in to place, that you just strap in for the ride and enjoy it. The action scenes are some of the most original and exciting I've ever read - and having just finished the second book, I can say that it doesn't stop here... But is it better than... So, I'm guessing you have already read the synopsis, so I won't go into that or any spoilers, instead I'll compare to some of the other, similar fantasy series I've read. The First Law These books are amazing, and the way they throw around the usual Fantasy tropes is amazing. They're a close second as my favourite fantasy books. That said, the Stormlight books are a far more epic and serious. The scope is just bigger. They're much more hard fantasy and the First law books occasionally have a slightly self-ironic expression. The world in the First Law books is much more simple and more of a setting that an active part of the story. In Stormlight you feel the world is huge and complicated, and much more believable. The characters are at first more interesting in First Law, but they don't have the progression that makes you empathise the way you do in Stormlight. Farseer books Less brooding. Granted, it's a huge problem I have with the Farseer books, I get annoyed when the character uses to much time going around in circles, having inner battles and turmoil, not moving the plot along or seeing what is painfully obvious. Kaladin, one of the main characters, does spend some time battling his inner demons, but it never gets to the point where it's annoying and it is really important to the story. And while he has his demons, his still really awesome. I was in a place where I was tired of the flawed hero, and wanted one that could be really kickass. Sanderson delivered - in more ways than one. Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) OK, these are probably the biggest thing since Lord of the Ring, and deserves it. Stormlight has a very detailed and complex world with political scheming and plotting - but it never threatens ASOIAF gritty, complex world, with all the gears moving and changing in a way that's is just so realistic and complex that it might as well be real. Why, the, do I prefer Stormlight? I'll tell you - they are never boring. You never have a character that you're just reading to get to the next. You never have to skim pages detailing the food or clothes of unimportant characters that you'll never hear of again. There's no boring characters. Maybe that's part of what makes GRRM's books so realistic, but I only have so much time and I prefer to spend it entertained... Kingkiller I'm not the biggest fan of Kingkiller, mostly because I don't really like the main character, but one thing I adored about it was its magic system. Complex, believable and with rules and limitations. The magic system in Stormlight is similar in that regard. While more magical, it makes sense and is confined. Eventually, it get's a superhero feel to it. I'm not sure if that sounds campy, but it really works in the story, working with the plot without being a deux ex or making anything to easy for the main characters.

"B00DA6YEKS","4","Liked it, but didn't love it","So, after 48 hours of audio, here is my full review of Words of Radiance by Brandon Sanderson. This is volume two in the planned 10 book series of The Stormlight Archive and is the sequel to Way of Kings. I really enjoyed Words of Radiance. However, it was by no means perfect. For once I’d like to start with what I didn’t like about the book. What I didn’t like The dialogue. Not all the time, but on many occasions I found the dialogue too… modern. Every time I heard “yeah” or “guy” or “awesome” I cringed inside. I imagine Sanderson was trying to convey a sense of informality and friendliness between the characters, but for me I was immediately thrown out of the world of Roshar into modern day North America. Perhaps that’s a purely personal reaction, but it did spoil the experience for me. it was especially jarring in the audio version. The pacing. I don’t mean the pacing within the book itself – I didn’t have a problem with that. I’m referring to the fact that we’re only at the end of book two and already we have the Everstorm about to turn back and cause major destruction as well as turn all the parshmen slaves into Voidbringers. Most fantasy series tend to have such destruction towards the end of the series. Wheel of Time’s Last Battle was in book 14. We still haven’t seen the threatened zombie apocalypse in George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire and we’re on book five of seven. I just have to wonder where Sanderson has left to go in the Stormlight Archive. Now, it could be that the Everstorm turns out to be only a minor threat to Roshar and that Odium is the equivalent of the Last Battle. We’ll have to see. Sanderson is well known as an Architect type writer in that he has everything planned out meticulously rather than a Gardener like George R.R. Martin who allows the story to develop more organically, so I will have to trust that he knows what he is doing. What I liked The structure. Words of Radiance follows the same structure as Way of Kings. This involves a prologue, then switching between three or four tightly focussed viewpoints, one of which expands a character’s story with flashbacks. Additionally the main sections of the book are broken up by Interludes from minor characters to provide information otherwise not available to the reader. This worked very well. It kept the pace brisk, allowed us to really get to know the main PoV characters but added new insights through the Interludes. The Radiants. This book focuses on the re-establishment of the Knights Radiant which is a major story arc throughout the book. This provided a wonderfully cohesive theme across all the PoVs and interludes. Naturally, we expected our main characters Kaladin, Shallon and Dalanar to be well on the way to becoming Radiants and we were not disappointed. What was nicely done though was the path by which they are working towards that goal. There was some wonderful character development in this regard. I was also interested in the sort of anti-Radiants being collected by Darkness; we see this through the Szeth and Lift Interludes. This looks to provide some interesting conflict in books to come. Worldbuilding. Sanderson continues to build upon his world of Roshar. I enjoyed his development of the Radiant/spren connection, although I’m still not quite certain I understand about the various types of Shardblade (live spren? dead spren? bonding?) so if anyone can clarify that for me I’d be very grateful. I particularly appreciated the development of the Parshendi through Eshonai’s Interludes – I found it fascinating and moving. Such a pity about the timing. I imagine the story would have been very different if Eshonai had met with Dalinar before going into the storm. The narration. As usual Kate Reading and Michael Kramer do a wonderful job narrating the books. Given that the book is over 48 hours, it’s nice to have a switch up of narrator. I was amused that both seem to consider the Herdazians British! Despite the few flaws I mentioned, I did enjoy Words of Radiance. I wouldn’t’ say I loved it, or that it’s the best book I’ve read this year, but I gave it a solid four stars out of five.","2014-03-15","United States","","true","29","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVLH7JOTCI1I5"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","Even better than The Way of Kings.","I'm going to praise this work by comparing it to another outstanding series, The Chronicles of Malick, by W. R. Harris. You can tell how good a series is going to be in the second book. For Harris it was Arachana and in this series, it's Words of Radiance. The second book shouldn't be a repeat of the first but a growing extension of the story. If done correctly, successive books in the series should get better and better in both content and power—Words of Radiance exemplifies this. In the first book, I had my doubts about the interlude chapters because they seemed distracting. I was wrong! The Interlude chapters in this book are fabulous and only build the overall story of this land and its inhabitants. The interlude chapter with the street urchin is pure gold!","2025-02-24","United States","","true","30","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B66U63IRY6XS"

"B00DA6YEKS","5","like a wave of tingling energy passes over your scalp","I've seen reviews and comments where people say that this book has too much filler for 5 stars. I have to disagree, in fact, one of Sanderson's strengths seems to be knowing just how far to drag you along with moderately paced development, until you're practically screaming at the book in front of you to make the leap you know has to be coming. And then it comes, and The Moment happens, and your blood is on fire, like a wave of tingling energy passes over your scalp, and its perfect. I've been skeptical about Sanderson since I first read of him. Too much hype. Wheel of time was too sacred for such a new author. Book summaries always started with ""after turning the fantasy world on its head with his smash debut Elantris..."" This sort of thing turns me off, over celebrated commercial successes. I read Elantris anyway, and while i thought him a decent writer, it lacked a certain depth that, while somewhat rare, authors like Rothfuss and Modessitt had spoiled me with. I went on to the Mistborn trilogy anyway, and it was a little better. A little darker than I'd prefer, but his world building skills are just top notch, and in my opinion this carried the series despite a few plot holes and over reliance on action scenes. overall, I was mildly impressed. Then I spotted The Way of Kings, for free. I figured, even if its just another Mistborn level book, Mistborn occupied me for a while, and this ones free! The Way of Kings was significantly better, more interesting, better developed, more complex and yet also more cohesive. Overall I thought it dragged a little too much in some spots, but not by much. Sanderson seems to know just how long to make you wait for The Moment. Words of Radiance cost more than I usually spend on a book (unless gift cards are involved), but I didn't even hesitate after the way the first book ended. As I've already said, Sanderson has a talent for making you wait just long enough, until you're ready to throw the book at the wall. Words of radiance was far better than I expected. As others have said, the book gets inside you. I got stuck not being able to read for a day when I was in a somewhat depressing point in the book and I swear I actually moped around, in a funk, the entire time. This book has several Moments (one of which is a clear winner, but still), and they're perfect. Sanderson has learned from his previous works, and it shows. All the things I disliked about earlier works, while not gone completely, are more tempered and subtle. Knowing there will be 8 more books I'm a little scared that Sanderson will fall into a trap similar to the one Jordan landed in, with books 4-8 being ..... unnecessary, lacking in plot development, not terrible exciting, short insignificant action scenes being the only highlights, and afterwards just the blurry recollection of what happened before the good stuff at the end. The works of Sanderson, especially the Stormlight Archives series, seem too well put together for that, like the whole series was written before the first book was released so there's no contradictions and everything meshes perfectly. I just hope he can keep it up. I can not fully describe the effect this book had on me, other than to say my scalp still tingles from time to time when I remember a certain part and try to anticipate what is coming in the next installment. Very very few book have had this effect on me, I can count them on 1 hand. Maybe by the end of this series I'll need 2 hands.

"B00DA6YEKS","4","Excellent follow-up to THE WAY OF KINGS!","Whew, 48+ hours of audiobook! That was intense! The Stormlight Archive are the longest books I’ve ever read, followed shortly in number by A Song of Ice and Fire. What I love about these enormous books and series is that there’s just so much going on and authors like George R.R. Martin and Brandon Sanderson have a way of spacing all of the characters out enough so that each one has their own individual story but then when they unite or cross paths with other characters, you find out exactly how their stories were meant to line up all along and we just weren’t seeing the bigger picture yet! WORDS OF RADIANCE starts crossing all of those paths set up in THE WAY OF KINGS so it was great to see how these stories are coming together and where the big picture is going! I enjoyed WORDS OF RADIANCE more than THE WAY OF KINGS because I was better able to see this big picture. I’m so used to shorter series, both in number of pages and in number of books. Since The Stormlight Archive is currently planned to be ten books, there’s so much to explore throughout the whole series that a lot of secrets need to be kept in the first few books before reveals start happening, so at times, this series does seem a bit slower than other series I’ve read. It’s not really a bad thing, because I love really getting into this world and having this fantasy world feel so incredibly real with all of its detail, but it just doesn’t have me falling in love with this series as much YET since I’m still learning so much about it. I really liked the character development within this booke. Shalan grew a bit in THE WAY OF KINGS but she really starts to develop as a character in WORDS OF RADIANCE. Her role in the series is much more obvious in this book and she gets tied to many more characters and having already ready OATHBRINGER now as well, it’s great to see how much she grows and becomes more involved in each book, looking back on where she first appeared in THE WAY OF KINGS. I still love Dalinar and Kaladin and I’m enjoying their characters even more as the series progresses and the supporting characters, like those of Bridge Four, are outstanding additions to the book to bring some levity, camaraderie, and so much more. I liked getting more hints about the world but I’m still thirsty for so much more world-building! I have SO many questions that I know will get answered but again, I’m used to shorter series where I get more reveals much quicker so it’s hard to tell myself that they will be coming! Brandon Sanderson’s world-building is so incredibly interesting and now that I’ve learned so much about the Cosmere in general, it’s easier to see how each book of his set in this universe are starting to tie together. Things that I’ve read in other books are really starting to connect in The Stormlight Archive and this series has the most information about this universe, in my opinion. I also like how there are interludes in these books, allowing other important POVs to come in. Some I liked, some I didn’t. I hated Lift’s POV interlude and was upset that she was going to become a main part of the series, being the main character in the EDGEDANCER novella, but I’ll get more into that with OATHBRINGER since that’s where she starts becoming more important. I really like the interludes that offer small pieces of important things later on, or ones that fill in some missing pieces of what we’ve already learned. So far this isn’t my favorite Brandon Sanderson series but it certainly has potential! The more I read, the more I get into this story and fall in love with the characters, and clearly we’re going to be spending a lot of time together! I don’t know if it was a good or bad idea to read the first three books in one year since I’m going to be waiting very, very long for the rest of the series but I’m also glad I was able to do that so I could really get a solid feel for this world and have the characters stick in my mind so well!","2018-01-18","United States","","true","33","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29KKHGLL7P5HM"

"B00DA6YEKS","5","Pretty dang freaking awesome :)","The continuing stories of the multiple main characters: Kaladin, Shallan, and Dalinar, and to some extent Adolin, the Assassin in White, Jasnah, and about 20 other side characters. It's fun to see the multiple plots and characters that were distinctly separate in the first book begin to converge and meet each other. I was particularly please with Kaladin and Shallan in the chasms, and will be really interested in their continued relationship growth, romantic or otherwise. The best parts: getting some answers that were needed from the first book; I actually loved the Shallan plot-line, though many readers can't stand her or her story. I think she's amazing. DID NOT see that coming, the big reveal at the end. I knew she'd been through some stuff, but it hadn't even crossed my mind! She's smart, brilliant even, but there's something a bit off about her. Old enemies from the first book are her allies, and her spren is a bit too interested in lies to find her completely trust-worthy. But all this makes me just like her more. She's her own person, she does her thing. Her hands get plenty bloody in this book, but to me her heart remains pure (unlike Kaladin, who goes through the opposite: it seems like his hands are clean but his heart is dark and bitter and he has a lot of growth to go through. I was a lot more annoyed with him to see him become like those he despised... it took him long enough to realize what the problem was!). It's hard in a world with such amazing strong characters like Dalinar and Kaladin to not fade into the background and let them take over the story. The part where she stands up to Dalinar is one of my favorite moments! She doesn't give what she had away to other characters of power, she saved what was hers. Also loved Shen, though he has not a big role most of the book. Also, more magic=more better. Also, although they were disturbing, kudos for a truly horrific bad guy that is still mysterious and difficult to understand. But ok, when ****************GIANT SPOILER*****************Adolin stabs Sedeas in the eye, I was a little bit happy, like FINALLY that guy gets something he deserves, I HATED that guy!!that was awesome.***********END SPOILER*********** Not as good in my opinion: Yeah, Kaladin, his story arc in this book, I thought he was being kind of a jerk, and pretty dense. Not smart. Buck up buttercup! I also felt sorry for the Parshendi, their plot was not my favorite because it's so sad. Same with the Assassin in White, didn't appreciate him just becoming completely (view spoiler) I was hoping he'd get to do some good after all his suffering. Also, so many of the names are similar, I started losing track of who was who. Some of the internal monologues the characters had with themselves was a bit repetitive and long winded, but also had a somewhat annoying habit of ending abruptly. But I guess that's true to life, so ok fine. Also, it's hard to be a fan of Sanderson and not a fan of gruesome violence, so I do suffer a bit through the more disturbing deaths and battles, I never am very happy there. And I don't find it necessary. Overall I LOVED this book for it's depth and breadth, and not the least awesome thing about it was it's promise. I think one thing that really makes me love it is that for as far as we've come, we're no where near the end. We have a huge, long journey to travel with these characters, and I know there are many more surprises to come. New characters, new plots, new revelations. Can't wait till the next one.","2014-07-22","United States","","true","37","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ME0M09GIL586"

"B00DA6YEKS","5","Beautifully crafted work that lives up to the definition of ""epic""","Brandon Sanderson is no stranger to epic fiction, either in his own original work with the Mistborn series or taking Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time to the finish line. Two books in, The Stormlight Archive already feels on par with the best realized worlds ever imagined in epic fantasy fiction. Words of Radiance manages to surpass its predecessor The Way of Kings in nearly every way. The protagonists who provide the main points of view stay the same from the first book although their characters have progressed in meaningful ways. Kaladin grapples with his newfound responsibility and respectability as the captain of a highprince's guard. Shallan travels across the sea to reveal the truths about the return of the Voidbringers. Dalinar continues his quest to unite the fragmented society of Alethkar, while his son Adolin works to further his father's end using his martial prowess. In my opinion Sanderson's single most impressive achievement is making each of the characters equally compelling. There was never a point where I flipped the page and groaned because, for example, it was a Shallan chapter and I wanted to get back to a Kaladin chapter. The challenges and struggles each face are so different as well as their approaches to dealing with them that each thread has its own relentless momentum that compels the reader onward. They are each highly sympathetic in their own way. That being said, I have to admit that I looked forward to the Kaladin chapters the most anyways. Shallan has a number of flashback chapters dealing with her life before the beginning of the series that I initially found tiresome, but there is a hugely satisfying payoff for this reminiscing near the end which made it all worthwhile. The second area that never ceases to impress is how well realized the world of Roshar is. Sanderson is a master at constructing entirely new forms of fauna, flora, industry, weaponry, and so on. All are plausible and somewhat familiar in the context of our real world but different enough to capture the imagination. I found myself frequently grinning when he launches into detailed explanations of doing a drawing, or how the ecosystem of the Shattered Plains functions, or the nuances of the Stormlight magic system - these are so well thought-out and plausible that you constantly want more tidbits to fill out your knowledge of the universe he's created. He's clearly done his homework on a dizzying array of real-world subjects to inform this work and it shows. One significant improvement for me was the diminished usage of lengthy interior monologues performed by a certain POV character in favor of actual dialogue and interaction between characters. If I could come up with one downside, the ending was a little too clean for my tastes. What I mean is that there are still numerous plot threads left hanging and by no means close to being resolved, but enough of the major plotlines have resolved to the point where I would be fine if this was the ending for the entire series. Don't get me wrong, the fact that we have eight more books to look forward to fills me with bountiful joy. But The Way of Kings ended at a point where I truly needed to read the next points before feeling satisfied with where the characters end up. I can share at least a hundred more positive points about this book. Read it but be prepared to have large amounts of your life and free time sucked away in the process. And definitely pick up the first book in the series before getting into this one as it will definitely be more than worth your while.","2014-03-20","United States","","true","39","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XAB7YTTJFCSR"
"B00DA6YEKS","4","Approaching greatness, but not there yet- perhaps it is... too perfect? I'll explain below.","Here's the thing with Fantasy- much of the stuff out there is rehashed plots and themes borrowed from the past 50 years of writing. Every magic system has been done 13 times over, there's enough orphans to fill a Dickens' novel, a you are going to most likely run into a big baddie with god-like powers that can only be defeated using a magical relic/weapon/inner power that is conveniently left laying around/inside a relative's trunk/passed down generation to generation for our hero to stumble across. Oh and there's probably gonna be some sweet lovin' along the way with some princess that only wears a loincloth and bikini top and really likes getting busy with young magic wielding, socially awkward orphans. Thankfully Sanderson has taken the Fantasy genre and made it his own. Mistborn was the sign of something great coming along down the line, the last books of WOT breathed new life into the series, and Stormlight has the potential to eclipse most of the fantasy drivel of the past 25 years. It has memorable characters, an inventive magic system, and a world that seems as vibrant as Middle Earth, if not more so. Is it perfect? No. But that's the beauty of creation and art- there is nothing perfect. We all approach art with our own preconceived notions of what is beauty and worthy of praise. A novel like Words of Radiance is no different. If you love Sanderson's other work you will adore this novel. If you like your magic system to have a logical, balanced, and ordered framework you will love this novel. If you want a quick and action-filled novel with a neatly wrapped up finale... you will probably not like this novel. (Which is a shame because more novels should be this well planned out) Our main protag Kaladin takes a slight backseat to Shallan, and at first I fought this choice. Then I realized it made for a better story and opened up the world outside of the shattered plain. Her backstory is actually more intruiging than Kaladin's and worthy of being placed at the forefront of the novel. My only (slight) gripe with this novel is the (slight) predictability of the ending and the (slightly) annoying mopiness of Kaladin. I understand completely why the character had to go through this transition, and it will make for a stronger character in the third novel, but it felt a bit...formulaic? You can tell that Sanderson is a professor, he knows exactly what he's doing when planning a novel. He has all the right flaws, beats, arcs, conflicts, supporting characters etc. in place- it is textbook on the button. If you have watched his excellent free podcast Writing Excuses, or have read other author's books on writing, you will instantly see signs of their advice in Words of Radiance. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because of this... ...He had done too good of a job. (Throw that quote on the jacket!) I was hoping for a curveball here, a red herring there- something that would throw me off a bit more. It is tough to do this in fantasy, but in so many ways Sanderson succeeds. The magic system is still mysterious, the history of the world is still not known, and we've seen glimpses of antagonists that defy fantasy cliches. The characters are alive and well fleshed out, the spren are a wonderful creation, and the dialogue is fantastic. The fault is not with Sanderson, but with me. I have read too much fantasy/sci fi, and most of it bad. I have studied Stephen King's, Orson Scott Card's, Donald Maass' and Sanderson's notes on writing hoping to one day write a novel of my own. I have a long, long way to go and I hope one day to write just a single chapter that is as good as Sanderson's stuff. I hope going forward this series breaks even more fantasy molds and cliche's and takes us places that we did not expect. I'm simply holding Sanderson to a higher standard because I see in him potentially the best fantasy series we've ever had the privilege to read. Thank you Brandon- can't wait to see where you take us!","2014-03-19","United States","","true","40","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FYMYVP7COZSK"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","My Favorite Book Series, Character Development Greatly Expands on Way of Kings, Historic Fantasy Series in the Making","Brandon Sanderson is my new favorite author, I am blown away at the amount of books and the creativity of the various stories he is working on at any given one time. Of all his series, this is the one I would most highly recommend. I would say it is my current top favorite book series, and i would compare it to the likes of The Name of the Wind (though Sanderson cranks out books much much faster than Rothfuss), A Song of Ice and Fire series (a.k.a. A Game of Thrones, though this series is much more fantasy/magic oriented), and a Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan (interestingly enough Sanderson was asked to finish that series when the author passed away). I would describe this series as a high fantasy/epic fantasy series that's deep in variety of cultures, lore, and magic system. It is not merely a fun little fantasy read to pass the time (I enjoy them on occasion, but they have their time/place), but rather a well written/crafted, multi-layered series that is going to span 10 large books of intricate relationships and layered stories. One of the things Sanderson does very well is character development, so if magic is not your thing, he still does a great job making you care about the various characters, their motives, and how they grow as individuals. Beyond this though, he is a little more fantasy heavy in creating fictitious creatures, wildly varying races with very pronounced characteristics, and new world-wide climate and environmental details that contribute well to the story. He does this in a well executed and believable narrative, however, so it's not too cheesy or far fetched. This series is meant to be comprised of 10 books, each from various characters perspectives, but with each book focusing on the backstory, and the perspective of a different main character. Note that these books tend to reach toward the 2000 page mark. They play into a larger set of rules and lore that he has deemed his Cosmere and tie into other such stories as The Mistborn Series, and Warbreaker (note that these aren't necessarily overt connections, but that his overall magic system explanations, and some of the foundational structure to these worlds and how they work is connected, there are even some cameos from mysterious/not entirely well understood characters). --Book plot details and possible spoilers below-- This book is told from the perspective of Shellan, and I really grew to like her as a character in this book, the allusions and slight mystery created in The Way of Kings gets better fleshed out/explored, and some of the mysteries behind her past are finally put to rest. Beyond that, this book was very heart wrenching as it follows Kalladin and his development as a person/character. It was tough to see him struggle through so much difficulty, especially with how likeable he can be. I found myself being upset at him, rooting for him, and relating to his struggles in a roller-coaster of emotions through this book. The ending is very satisfying with just enough set up, action, and cliffhangers to leave me sated, yet wanting more. The series alludes to great magic battles and starts to set up some nice action sequences, but the series as a whole has the potential for so much more epic confrontations that I am very much looking forward to. This book merely wets your appetite with a small set of action sequences that are still pretty great with flying magic duels and awesome magic awakening moments.","2017-09-15","United States","","true","41","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIMU3D7AA3UWM"
"B00DA6YEKS","4","Not quite as good as the first but still enjoyable","Book 2, like the first, rotates between characters a lot but spends the majority of the time on Shallan’s story. Personally I find her story less interesting than Kaladin’s possibly because she operates more as an intellectual trying to figure things out and there isn’t as much action. I also do not find her backstory to be as compelling. Kaladin’s story in this book also becomes more mundane as he is simply a guard for the first half of the story then becomes a moody person for most of the second half before emerging from his funk at the end. He practices with his powers from time to time but they are mostly not used throughout this book. The author likes to build up the tension in the book and then leave you on a bit of a cliffhanger while switching to another set of characters which I find a bit annoying. It’s one thing to do this in a TV series in order to get you coming back to view the next episode the following week but in this book, I found myself trying to speed read through the less interesting characters so that I could find out what the resolution was to the built up conflict. All in all, I am excited to see where this series goes next and what is in store for the Knights Radiant.","2024-09-28","United States","","true","42","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ERC5XO9FWCTJ"

"B00DA6YEKS","5","A master class in storytelling.","Let me begin by saying I will try to avoid spoilers, but STORMFATHER WHAT A BOOK! I remember reading that Sanderson wanted to pump out 1 book in the storm light archive every year and being disappointed that it took him almost 3 years. Granted he did have to finish wheel of time, but I desperately wanted a sequel to the way of kings. And it was worth the wait. Every page, every sentence, every interaction is beyond masterful. Sanderson brings life to characters like no other author I've ever read. Each character has their own unique morals, plans and goals, and most importantly, voice. My biggest problem with the way of kings was that Sanderson spent so much time delving into Kaladin's story that all the other characters, particularly Shallan felt two dimensional and very black and white. That being said, every single character has more depth then the first book. Even new characters, particularly Lift, Pattern, Wyndle, have an instant depth and like-ability that has to be experienced. He has also taken minor characters from the first book and made them much mor like able. Renarin in particular simultaneously breaks my heart and makes me smile. He so desperately wants to be a hero like his dad and brother, but he knows he never will be but doesn't let that hold him back and never stops trying. I also like how Sanderson gave characters their own sense of humor. Lift, Kal, Shallan, Pattern, Syl, Rock, Lopen, Wit and even Adolin all have a unique, and hilarious sense of humor that brings life to the characters and a smile to your face. I particularly like Lift and her ""captured Voidbringer"" Wyndle (who I feel like has a British accent). In the beginning of the book I was very happy to see that Sanderson wasn't going to be the author who makes his characters invincible when he killed off one of the characters. I was actually happy when it happened because he killed her, no room for debate, she was dead, and it made another characters story instantly more interesting. I was disappointed when in the last 5 pages he does a complete 180 and does something that I don't think he should have done. He better be able to explain it well and stop brining characters back from the dead. With the plot, Sanderson redefines epic fantasy. Look out Tolkien, Martin, and Jordan, Sanderson's here and he's putting all of you to shame. Literally dozens of different storylines somehow meld and warp into one amazing plot. The subplots are particularly fun because they leave you wondering where on earth Sanderson is going. Here's hoping he doesn't lose control of the story like Jordan did when it got to big and to epic. Lastly, there are only three authors have sucked me in and not let go until it's 3 am and I've read 400 pages in one sitting. Those authors are Rothfuss (anyone who's read The name of the wind knows what I'm talking about), Matthew Ryan (if u don't know who he is go check out Blood Song and prepare for one of the most amazing characters you've ever read. Keep an eye out for Ryan, he's going places) and Sanderson. I bought this book when it came out on Tuesday 3/4 and I just finished it 5 days and 1100 pages later. I am so enraptured with this series that I am going to sit and hold my breath until Sanderson gives me book #3.","2014-03-08","United States","","true","44","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EE8A9R2M3SU"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","Another magnificent book!","Mild SPOILERS ahead: I have mixed feelings about Words of Radiance> First the awesomeness: As always, Brandon Sanderson has taken us on an unbelievable and at times surprising ride. The writing is tight. Brandon doesn't give us pages and pages of unnecessary description to drudge through. The dialogue is believable and crisp. We don't get pages of sermons from anyone. The characters feel real to me. I want to get to know more about Kaladin, Dalinar, Bridge Four etc. Heck, I even came to like Adolin in this book, though I despised him in the first. I root for characters. I despise other characters. I pity one or two characters. The world building is brilliant. There isn't a Fantasy writer that comes close to Sanderson when it comes to sheer magnitude and the immersive nature of Epic Fantasy world building. Sanderson simply is the master. No one comes close. As for the story -- it's awesome! We didn't have to wait five books or ten books for Sanderson to fulfill a LOT of promises to his readers. No waiting five years or ten years to get some some resolution and character development. We didn't have to wait half a dozen books to get the first glimpse of the Knights Radiant or the Voidbringers. We get them NOW in book two! To me, that is a huge relief! Sanderson remembers what it is like to wait years and years before something awesome happens in a series. All of us Fantasy fans know that feeling. And I'm glad he doesn't play that game. He puts something out there then delivers! This is why he is my favorite working writer today! But something left me feeling like Words of Radiance doesn't quite live to Way of Kings. Of course, the final 20% is typical Sanderson brilliance. The cascading climaxes. Kaladin making the BIG decision and . . . well, the awesomeness that goes with being a Radiant. I LOVED the whole thing, but I will admit that Shallan really, really drug down the book for me. Not all throughout the book, but through much of the middle Shallan became an annoying and BORING person to follow. All of the revelations in her background are surprising. And it explains a LOT about her. But that doesn't mean her chapters weren't boring. I just did not care for her, and began to actually hate her until near the end of the book. I didn't calculate, but I suspect 60% of the chapters are from Shallan's POV and that was just too much for me. Yet, I know other people that just love Shallan and so it really is just a matter of taste. In the end, she doesn't bring down the overall story. I still think Kaladin is the star, but I can definitely jump on the Adolin band wagon as well. The scene between him and Kaladin, when Kaladin is released from prison, won me over. The book is brilliant. Many of our questions are answered, and we are given new questions to ponder. And best of all, Kaladin and Syl kicks butt, big time! For that alone, I think Words of Radiance is over all a more fulfilling read. But the Shallan chapters (particularly in the middle of the book) do knock it down for me to 4 stars. But because Kaladin's story is executed so beautifully, and his story is SO satisfying I can't help but give it 5.","2014-05-15","United States","","true","45","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IYWEI6LU07HH"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","Such Agony","Why the agony, you ask? Here's the deal: 4 years since the last (and first) book in this 10 book series. We all know that this was due to the time invested in finishing Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. Four years is a long time, however, so when Words of Radiance came out I realized that I needed to re-read book 1 before starting this one. Glad I did. These two back to back combined with work and life and such lasted me almost 2 weeks. That's 2 weeks of heaven, a chance to explore another unique world masterly crafted by Mr. Sanderson. I still remember stumbling across the Mistborn series. What a delicious find! How fascinating the extrapolation of a particular phenomenon can be! In Mistborn, the inherent ability to ""burn"" metals, thus gaining powers and abilities. In the Stormlight Archive, the technology revolves around capturing and using Stormlight, and the story involves a world that has recurring disasters. The problem is, there are so many thousands of years between these recurring disasters that people forget / churches change written documents / the truth is obscured in between episodes. Whatever the nature of the impending disaster actually is has yet to be revealed. We start to see that the people in charge the last time tried really hard to figure out a way to protect the people in the future if there ever was a next time. We get hints of what happens to a society that grows powerful enough to defeat the enemy, but remains weak in other ways. How does a society deal with all that power once the enemy is gone? Will it become corrupted, as is the inherent tendancy of man? It seems to me that there was such a problem in the ancient history of this world. The folks in charge then had to figure out a way to bottle up the extra-powerful stuff in such a way that it wasn't there for misuse, but would still be available if and when it was needed. Interesting problem eh? Especially so when the cyclical disaster is so horrid that it means the destruction of society and near-extinction of humans every time it happens. Thousands of years of culture, history, art, and science, lost time and again. So that's the premise; with the existence of fabrials comes the thought that they were somewhat like computers, able to store bits of personality or record messages that could be transmitted to people in the future. Fabrials allow the user to store and manipulate energy that comes from Stormlight. The other thing that Sanderson begins to show us about this world is the interconnected nature of humans and Spren. Spren are elemental entities that can exist on more than one plane of reality, somehow dealing with different physics depending on what plane of existence they occupy. The Spren are the key to everything; can't wait to see future development of the blending of physical and spiritual that the spren represent. So, hopefully Mr. Sanderson will produce these a bit faster than every 4 years. Do the math. Eight more books, 24 more years...I might not be alive that long! This is the Agony of my review title; this is the painful need to have the story continue, the amazing people come to life, the urge to finish the story. Thank you Mr. Sanderson, for a world-class epic.","2014-04-24","United States","","true","46","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2N37BRINHWPWG"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","A treat for fans of epic fantasy - and a bigger one for fans of Sanderson, clued into the 'Cosmere'","I finished this book a few hours ago, at the cost of some much needed sleep, and have been 'hungover' on it ever since. I was reading it at a leisurely pace, hoping to finish it over the rest of this week, but the book had other ideas.. Past roughly the half-way mark it kicked into high gear and became (at the risk of using a cliche) unputdownable. Oh well, so long sleep! Mr Sanderson continues to shine as one of the finest world-builders and story-tellers writing high fantasy at the moment. I am impressed how much plot and world-building he has fitted into this one book. He accomplishes this while maintaining a focus on three or four primary POV characters - Kaladin the slave turned savior, Shallan the provincial prodigy, Dalinar the warrior driven by fate, and off on a side, Szeth the conflicted assassin. This is very much a continuation of their story. If the first book was Kaladin's (with detailed flashbacks to a Gladiator-like back-story) this one is Shallan's book, as we learn how and why she ended up where she did in the first volume. The world deepens in this book as much as do these main characters because the author offers 'interludes' to the main story. These are spread far and wide in the world geographically, and focus on some characters that one assumes will play pivotal roles in later books. Some of these interludes work like short stories, and are delightful asides/ breaks from the main story. I will not write a summary of the plot, but suffice it to say it is jam-packed with exposition and events. Any average writer would have saved some of the chapter endings to cap a book entire - or a TV series season! A lot of them I could not predict - although a central element of Shallan's back-story became rather obvious by the time it was revealed. I remember thinking the final few pages of ""The Way of Kings"" were one knock-out punch after another - well, the final 200 pages of this book are one ferocious UFC prize-fight after another! Events that the author could have easily spent foreshadowing for another book or two at least *cough*likeRobertJordan*cough* happen in quick succession. The ending is indeed an ending and not a cliffhanger. It is clear that we are done with the primary setting of the first two books - the intriguing 'Shattered Plains'. A number of very interesting (almost soap-operatic) elements are in place that should fuel the next few books in other parts of the world. Now as most fantasy fans know, this series is part of a larger picture. One book, one series at a time the author is building a wider story in this 'Cosmere' universe. Rest assured that you don't need to worry about that to enjoy these first two books in The Stormlight Archive. Knowing about it does help you enjoy the story on a meta-level though. Having read various other books in the design I can certainly recommend it to those who enjoy epic takes and like to find Easter eggs/ pore over online forum discussions :) I would recommend this book unequivocally as some of the most imaginative contemporary writing in epic fantasy. If you're a fan of fantasy fiction and not reading Sanderson's Stormlight Archive (and the wider 'Cosmere') you're truly missing a treat!","2014-04-29","United States","","true","47","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CDTL82NIH7Y7"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","The shortest 1100 page novel I ever read","What a ride! The second book in the Stormlight Archive takes the reader even deeper into the gargantuan world of Roshar, Sanderson has created by far one of the best Fantasy worlds I have ever taken a vacation too. For a nearly 1100 page novel it is surpisingly polt heavy, while the WoK had the uneviable task of introducing the reader to the stange world of Roshar, WoR focuses on character development and plot movement, while also expanding the world building Sanderson established in Book 1. The novel's main character this time is Shallan, I was not a big fan of hers in WoK, but by the end of this novel she stands as one of Sanderson's strongest characters to date, no longer serving as a vehicle purely for exposition delivery. The other characters from WoK are here as well Kaladin, Dalinar, Adolin, Szeth and all the rest are here, but this books is Shallan's to its core. The book is structured the same as WoK, with the 5 diffrent parts broken up by Interludes that introduce us to Roshar and its people, setting up plot points and establishing characters that will become important later on. Unlike WoK's Interludes I really liked these short trips into new lands and new heads, Lift, Rysn, Eshonai, and Tarravangian being my favorites (Lift is AWESOME!). Also this being Shallan's book Sanderson inserts flashback chapters to her life pre-WoK. These falshbacks are still my only real gripe about the first 2 books. I find them to be terrible momentum breakers, that make me groan when they appear. While I dislike them, they do serve the purpose intended by the author of deepening Shallan's character and providing much needed context to her situation and mindset. My gripe mostly comes from there being no true revaltions plot wise from these chapters, or least I learned nothing which I had not already gleaned and I think they would have served the story better had they been placed in the front of the novel and not lasted past Part 3 when everything starts to come to a head. But that is a minor structure gripe and they did not affect my overall enjoyment of the book. Overall I would rate this book as a 4 star experience, the 5th star comes purely from the presentation, the art work in these books is astounding, the Shallan sketches being a real treat again. From cover to cover the book is just beautifully laid out, the Cover by Whealan is fantastic as well as the end page of Shallan (which I kept flipping back to to stare at), the chapter icons, and other drawings all enhance the readers experince and help to sell the epic quality of these books. Words of Radience is an excellent continuation of the first novel and sets the stage for what should be an amazing epic in scope and narrative. While Sanderson's prose may be his weakest aspect as a writer, with each book he gets better and more adept at being a wordsmith. His other strengths as a writer such as world building, magic systems and storytelling are still masterful and I eagerly await the third novel. I must say I wish Sanderson had stuck with the working title Book of Endless Pages, that title would make me smile non-stop.","2014-03-13","United States","","true","48","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37IRM7YFCTVPN"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","Thoroughly enjoyed, from cover to cover. One heck of a read.","*Disclaimer* I hardly ever write reviews, even for books I really really liked , if that gives you any idea of how much I loved this book. Before I give you my thoughts, I need to put them in perspective for you by giving you a little bit of my reading history. I had always been a big Tom Clancy fan, and spent most of my reading on his books along with fiction and nonfiction military books and history. A good friend of mine who is also a huge Tom Clancy fan was always telling me about Wheel of Time. I wasnt sure I wanted to delve into a 14 book series, but I was always a fan of the fantasy genre ( although my experience was limited to movies). I picked up the Acacia series, and I was not impressed. After listening to my buddy rave about the final Wheel of Time books, I decided to give Way of Kings a try. Way of Kings caused me to fall in love with fantasy books. I decided after that book to begin the Wheel of Time series where I am currently on book 9. I eagerly anticipated Words of Radiance...and boy was I not disappointed. I spent a couple weeks reading it, so I can hopefully say with some sort of perspective that I am not overreacting. This was the single most enjoyable book from cover to cover that I have ever read.Thoroughly enjoyed every single chapter. There wasnt a spot in this book where I felt ""meh, this cant get over quickly enough"" , or where looking back I was ""bleh"" about. There was always anticipation when going into the next chapter. While I enjoyed the worldbuilding in Way of Kings, I am big on dialogue. There seemed to be a lot less world building in Words of Radiance, and a lot of meaningful dialogue Shallan, who to me was just ""ehhh, ok"" in the first book, gets a lot of attention and development in this book and is now up there with the likes of Dalinar and Kaladin and etc. I felt like the pacing was perfect. Though I will say that while we do learn a lot more about spren, the radiants, etc...there is still lots we dont know. While there seems to be a few ""bad guys "" or antagonists, there isnt an overall big, bad, evil dude that you can see the story headed towards a final confrontation with. At least he/she/it isnt revealed yet, and it leaves somewhat of an empty space as you dont have a single ""bad guy"" to root against. Many of the ""bad guys"" are genuinely corrupt but ""seem"" to have a righteous goal (mankind surviving the Desolations)and do terrible things they think are necessary to achieve that goal. Others dont seem to be terribly corrupt..more like brainwashed trying to achieve their righteous goal. The waters are muddied , IMO. While the entire book was thoroughly enjoyable from cover to cover, the last half of the book will be very hard to put down. Sanderson does a great job of building the book to a climax. Read it, I promise you wont be disappointed.","2014-04-20","United States","","true","49","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39FBD19ICTWGY"
"B00DA6YEKS","3","Brilliance Amid the Chaos: A Mixed Journey Through Words of Radiance","Brandon Sanderson’s Words of Radiance is an ambitious and sprawling sequel that delivers on many fronts but stumbles in others. One of the standout aspects of this novel is its character work. Shallan’s journey is both compelling and layered; watching her develop and explore her wit, artistic talents, and deeper emotional struggles is a highlight. Pattern, her spren companion, brings humor and curiosity to the story, adding a unique dynamic that enriches Shallan’s narrative. Eshonai, the Parshendi Shardbearer, is another character who captured my attention. Her perspective adds much-needed depth to the conflict, and I found myself craving more of her story. Syl, Kaladin's honorspren, is endlessly fascinating, acting as both a moral compass and a source of warmth in Kaladin’s darker moments. Meanwhile, Adolin’s charm and evolving relationship with his father made him a favorite of mine. However, the book’s biggest flaw lies in its pacing and structure. Sanderson writes many characters with the potential to be pivotal to the story, only to have them fade into the background without resolution. It left me feeling as though some of the narrative threads were abandoned, which diluted the emotional impact of certain scenes. The constant perspective shifts are also jarring. While I appreciate the grand scale of the story, the way it jumps between characters and subplots at such a rapid pace made it difficult to stay grounded in the plot. It felt like just as I was fully immersed in one storyline, I was yanked away to another, leaving me disoriented at times. Despite these issues, Words of Radiance has plenty to offer, especially for fans of epic fantasy. It’s imaginative, ambitious, and filled with memorable characters. However, its scattered pacing and unfinished character arcs prevent it from reaching its full potential.","2025-01-22","United States","","true","50","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EZ9PBQBYQ5X9"

"B00DA6YEKS","4","Enjoyable, well-written book looking for a good antagonist","Like many of the readers who may be posting a week after the book came out, I was a big fan of The Way of Kings and I enjoyed this book too. Certainly worth a read but I would very much recommend reading the first book and getting hooked first. I like Sanderson's job of pacing his novels and how he handles action sequences. The battles and duels really make you feel involved, and as others have commented, the novel feels shorter than it is. This book isn't as action packed as The Way of Kings and certainly starts slower but I recognize a series this long can't be all non-stop action and some character development (particularly for Shallon and Adolin) was needed. Sanderson is also one of the best at creating an extensive and yet logical fantasy world, with unique systems of spiritualism and magic. The mysteries and the questions keep you invested and you end up reading relentlessly to find out what you might learn next, but the author doesn't hold back from revealing answers just to keep you guessing. You learn a lot even as other mysteries unfold. So far as personal preference, I enjoyed the Shallan character and story arc FAR more in this book than in the Way of Kings (when I re-read the book recently I skipped over many of those sections). The character seems so different in the two books that it is hard to reconcile the two together, but I'm not complaining. The wordplay is a little strange, but I can accept it from her because I just write it off as being a quirk of her craziness. She is perhaps almost too impressive but I will take it for now. I also found Dalinar a much more enjoyable character this time around as I felt he seemed mysteriously foolish in the first book. In reading this book, the overall doom of the series doesn't quite hit home with me. Yes, the world is possibly going to end at the hands of an immense evil spirit, but it all seems vast and distant. The lack of an antagonist of note would be my major knock from an objective storytelling perspective. There are some characters with potential, but mostly the main characters are battling an inhuman force or their own foolishness. If anything, the personal antagonists seem weaker or marginalized in this book. While I don't long for anti-heroes (part of why I like these books) or cheer for villains having some better opposition would have pushed this book to a 5 star for me. From a personal perspective I also felt the Kaladin character arc was not as satisfying, and while the destination was good the path that got him there sometimes seemed forced and made it harder to feel connected or invested in the character. It is okay for choices to be illogical (we all do that sometimes), but there were times where choices just didn't make sense to me. I enjoy this book and Sanderson as an author in general and look forward to seeing where the books go. He seems like an author who is a strong finisher and I will eagerly look forward to the next book in the series.","2014-03-17","United States","","true","52","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VY3DJ0NB20J6"

"B00DA6YEKS","4","*spoilers in this review* - If you liked the first book, you'll enjoy this one. Same complaints remain.","Once again, this is a really interesting world to explore, and the writing has gotten even better this time around. No sloppy grammar issues in this book compared to the Way of Kings. Kaladin is still a brooding Goku in this book, and Shallan is a female Nicolas Cage in National Treasure. Both characters become more powerful and more interesting as we approach the ending of the story. Dalinar is still pretty cool, Andolin is always a likeable fellow, Wit still isn't very Witty and Jasnah is still a hard character to pin down. Some things that bug me: -Though it's not quite as bad as the first book, it's still gets bogged down in a slow moving plot until the final 200 pages. - Kaladin is a brooding whinebaby that drove me crazy through most of the book. And like the last book, he has some boring kindergarten-level morality lesson he has to learn before becoming a super saiyan. - Shallan's backstory wasn't as interesting at Kaladin's to me. The final twist revealing the origins of her mother's death is hinted at far too strongly for the reveal to be effective. - No sex, fondling, sexual jokes or anything. Sanderson has no problems letting the men (some women) slay countless enemies with bones breaking and blood gushing. But put them in a situation with a g-i-r-l and they are blushing and stuttering to no end. It's hilarious when a revealed safe hand becomes their version of pornography. I also haven't seen any LGBT characters which is unfortunate, given the opportunity with such a unique setting. - Interlude stories are supremely hit or miss. To the point where i've committed the sin of just skipping through some of them. Here are things I liked! + Szeth is an awesome villain. One that I feel compassion for, which is actually what makes a villain truly special. He's been lied to, manipulated and forced to commit atrocities that have broken him. When he learns the truth of things, the final battle with him is all the more sweeter. + Kaladin and Shallan's interaction in the chasms. Reading how the characters perceive each other, and how they in many ways heal each other is a great part of the book. Kaladin becomes much less obnoxious in these scenes and allows character growth from him. Whether that transforms into an eventual romance remains to be seen. It depends on where Andolin's story is heading... + The Everstorm, Odium, the dark spren and the entire apocalypse. These things are all cool and it's interesting to see how the story develops now that things have really taken off. + Taravangian becoming Dalinar's formidable opponent in the uniting of the world. + Secret societies with their own rules and goals and are shown throughout the book but never fully revealed. Clearly Dalinar has more to learn about who is really pulling the strings of the world's problems. -- If you read the first book and enjoyed it, this is more of the same, if not better. I wish the pacing was better, and some sequences were tightened up or edited out completely. The book sometimes can get into filler territory. The ending is always a blast here, and I'm committed to the series, as imperfect as it is. Can't wait for book 3.","2015-12-22","United States","","true","55","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AF8K2NB547JV"

"B00DA6YEKS","4","Green Embers Recommended","I have been highly anticipating this book since I read volume 1, The Way of Kings. The problem with Fantasy Series is the 2 to 3 year wait between books and if the author says this is going to be a ten book series it can bring a groan to the heart of any avid Fantasy reader. I am hopeful that now Brandon Sanderson is finished with The Wheel of Time, he can pump these books out at a faster pace (every six months would be nice [Okay, now who is living in a fantasy?]). Brandon Sanderson’s fantasy worlds have always felt unique and interesting, the world in this book is no different. I can see the careful planning he put into the world of this book that feels almost alien, every behavior and action of the creatures has a purpose. He created an environment that was bizarre and then said, “Now, how will humans adapt to this environment.” It is wonderful to see this kind of thought and attention to detail put into a Fantasy series. Like other popular Fantasy series, the lore and history before the story starts has been fully realized for thousands of years (which keeping track of that must be a colossal pain for Brandon). The story interwoven through the book at its base level is one of character growth. Every character has a path and obstacles to overcome, which transcend the physical plot. This book is almost like episode 2 of a TV show, not quite as good as episode 1 but serves as a bridge to further story development. There were certain plot developments that weren’t very hard to figure out the truth before the reveal, these were more about character struggles though and so even though as the reader I had a pretty good idea what was going on, I was okay with the author teasing until the full truth came out because the characters felt believable in their struggles with it. The greatest part about finishing this book, is it did a masterful job of progressing the overall series plot but still ended leaving me satisfied. I love books in series that can stand on their own and this one is no different. (Although I would highly recommend reading Book 1 first). The final part of the book was a masterstroke of writing. Even though the story was predictable (good guy wins, who would have thought?) it still had me enthralled, turning page after page (in the digital sense). One thing I find refreshing about this book is its overall tone. It has a more juvenile approach than say Game of Thrones, but it felt refreshing. The humor and wit of the characters and the modern idioms placed within left me smiling and wanting to keep reading. It was nice to read something different than previous fantasy books but not as dark and dreary as the modern style fantasy. The heroes in the book all felt realized and were all on the charming side, while the villains felt appropriately scummy. If you’re on the lookout for a new fantasy series and haven’t picked up book 1 yet, I highly recommend it. Book 2 continues on with and earns a solid recommendation from me. Verdict: Recommended","2014-03-28","United States","","true","57","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZJXOHJ83LGW9"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","This is IMMACULATE.","10 stars. 100 stars. This is the best book I’ll read in 2021. I’m calling it right now and it’s only January. “Do not let your assumptions about a culture block your ability to perceive the individual, or you will fail.” This book. This book! I cannot express how much I love this book and this series and whole universe of the cosmere that Brandon Sanderson has created. There is so so so much depth and lore here that I’m positive I missed so many details. It’s probably impossible to pick up everything on the first read. It is truly amazing how detailed and intricate Words of Radiance is. There is soooo much witty banter and underlying humor in the dialogue in this book. I was literally laughing out loud what felt like nearly every chapter. Especially during conversations involving Shallan—she is so clever and I love her personality so much. She’s definitely my favorite character. I love the use of fabrials to mimic modern technology in this series. How do you have modern technological advances in a medieval setting? Magic, of course! It’s very cool to see, and I love seeing the characters’ reactions to things we take for granted, like Shallan having warm running water for a bath or the stormlight-infused spheres providing light in a darkened room. I do not understand how this book was so good. Brandon Sanderson is so talented, and Words of Radiance was perfectly crafted. It has so many reveals at all the right moments; it has in-depth world-building and explanations of the magic systems; it has dynamic character arcs and hilarious dialogue; it paints the most vivid picture in your mind to the point that you’re sure Roshar is real, it has to be, because there are so many layers to this narrative that it seems almost impossible it’s a fabricated story and not a true history of a real planet out there somewhere. I’m in so much awe. And I keep hearing that Oathbringer is even better! I literally do not understand how that is even possible when this book is already perfection. And that ending! During the last eighty pages I was completely losing my crap, simultaneously hyperventilating and jumping up and down. Ugh. So good. If you’re a fan of epic fantasy, do yourself a favor and read the Stormlight Archive because there is nothing out there that even comes close to its quality and depth and amazingness. It is hands-down the best fantasy series being published today.","2021-02-02","United States","","true","58","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S774HEEHOESS"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","Brandon Sanderson is now my favorite writer of all time","I reread book one to refresh my memory, then moved on to this, book two. I would highly recommend that method, as it's been a few years since book one, and you'll definitely get more out of it, unless you have some kind of flawless memory. There are books that when you read them it's like the author is whispering things to you about the world. There is so much more to this book than the surface story, which on its own is fantastic. Brandon Sanderson manages to tell an epic tale that not only captivated my imagination, but actually made me feel better about the real world we live in, and humanity as a whole. Though the book is fantasy, the struggles and decisions the characters make translates readily to the problems we all face in our lives. It's rare for a fantasy book to leave me feeling better about the world WE live in, yet Brandon has done that. It's an extremely well thought out tale, I was as engaged (even MORE engaged at times) as I was reading George Martins' game of thrones series, but I prefer Sanderson to Martin because Sanderson doesn't have to go to disgusting places to keep me on the edge of my seat. While there are evil characters in Sandersons tale, he doesn't take me to a place so cruel and disgusting I wish I'd have skipped pages. Don't get me wrong, there is violence, etc but rather than FOCUS on the basest nature of humanity, Sanderson makes you believe people can be better. I finished the book filled with hope for OUR world, though earth/our real world has no mention or place in the story itself. Book two picks up right after the events in book one, I don't want to write any spoilers so suffice it to say, I enjoyed book two just as much as one. I CANT WAIT for the next book in the series, he does not leave you hanging at the end of this book, it's a satisfying ending, but obviously just the tip of the iceberg of where he is going with this series. I would buy the next book in this series over any other series by any other author. I can't recommend this series enough. Please start writing the next one as soon as possible Brandon, it's such a rare book that leaves me feeling so GOOD after reading it...and it's not that everything is roses and butterflies, its more like I feel as though I've had an existential conversation with him through the experiences of his characters. Difficult to explain....but not only is the story original and engaging, it has depth that only a master storyteller could so effortlessly weave into his words. I love you Brandon Sanderson, please continue to share your light with the rest of us.","2014-03-22","United States","","true","59","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12V3Z9YBF4POG"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","Best fantasy book I have read since I worked my way through Tolkien during summer camp 30 years ago","No spoilers follow - I would not consider revealing even one detail of this awesome book. Words of Radiance restores the fantasy genre to a level not seen in recent memory. I have come to expect big things from Brandon Sanderson but The Stormlight Archive shows just how truly great he is at creating compelling characters, putting them through the proverbial wringer and bringing them to a point where they can choose redemption or damnation, often in scenarios where the reader is uncertain as to which decision leads to which outcome. While the continuing story of Kaladin seems focused on the development of his (spectacularly thought-out by Sanderson) powers and their use in combat, the most important decision does not involve his actions, but rather his inaction. Sanderson is capable of telling a moral-tale without the reader realizing he is serving up some extraordinary lessons in ethics. I can't recall a book this entertaining which educates the reader on the differences between objective, relative and subjective ethics/morality without you knowing you are getting that education. There were a lot of readers who panned the first book in the series because there was too much character development and not enough action for a book of such length. I understood that criticism even if I disagreed at the time. It was my hope then that all of that character development in book one would lead to an explosion of action and plot revelations in the second book, and that is exactly what Words of Radiance brings. When characters suffer, are betrayed by friends or find the first stirrings of love, I felt it so much more because of how deeply invested I was in them and their background stories. A short book can be easy to read, but a character with no meaningful inner dialogue or personal history is not easy to identify with. Despite the length of these books, I never once felt like I was being led along. It is his talent for organized storytelling that led Robert Jordan's team to choose Sanderson to finish his sprawling Wheel of Time series to an appropriate, though long-past-due conclusion. Some authors are not particularly good at creating vivid battle descriptions (Tolkien, though the LOTR movies largely expanded successfully on the abbreviated combat scenes penned by Tolkien); Sanderson is not one of those. The final duel is one that will be talked about by generations of readers. I wish I could say more about this portion of the book, but it would reveal far too much about the story overall. Please do yourself a great favor and read this series. It will seem like an investment at first, but this investment comes with the greatest of literary returns.","2014-03-10","United States","","true","60","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PTHGZONIE6P6"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","An incredible Fantasy novel with content suitable for all ages","There are several things I look for in a novel... 1) An entertaining, original story that has great characters. 2) A story that may have ordeals, trials, temptations, depression, but that never feels too dark. Although I have read many of the ""gritty, realistic"" novels with amoral characters and anti-heroes, I prefer characters that make me WANT to be a better person because through difficulty they persevere. I truly like books that don't make me feel like I need to take a shower after having read the afternoon away. 3) A clean story that I can hand to my teenage sons with confidence that nothing in the book is pushing the story in a morally obtuse fashion. No sex, no modern swearing, no piggish men that all they can think about is sleeping with this or that female character. 4) A story where the characters are true heroes, often morally challenged, but generally make the right choice because they are HEROES! A few things that I love about this series. Characters: Kaladin, Shallan, Dalinar, and Adolin all have their strengths and weaknesses. They all strive to make the right choices. The World: Completely alien but described so well it feels real. The cultures, The flora and fauna, the weather patterns, it all makes sense. Interludes: 5 interludes (3 or so chapters, individual story for each chapter) are interspersed throughout the book. They are all short stories about characters that are generally not in the main course of the book but add back story and depth as to what is happening throughout the world. These stories are just great. Very well told! Magic System: It has a purpose and it makes sense. It is truth based. If you cannot live up to certain ideals you cannot expand your power. If you can discover the truth you advance. Its really great how this is done and tragic when one of the characters morally loses his way and begins to lose his power as a result of bad choices. Humor: Great humor in many parts especially in the interaction between a couple of the main characters when they meet for the first time. Bad guys: I love how the evil protagonists actually see what they are doing as ""necessary"" and ""justifiable"". You could make arguments that some of the villains are noble in their own way but you eventually learn they are morally bankrupt. Finally, there are many hints of things to come that are nicely foreshadowed and get you thinking. This is a projected series of 10 books but don't let you put this off. Both books in the series have a strong ending that leave you well satisfied as you turn the last page.","2014-03-28","United States","","true","61","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GB5XGCZZQPUU"

"B00DA6YEKS","5","Another great read from Mister Sanderson","English/Português Again, Brandon Sanderson delivers a fantastic book . Despite Kaladin being the same crybaby of the previous book and Shallan whining a lot too, both characters develop well their stories and their abilities. Shallan's travel and the evolution of her relationship with the spren are the strengths of the character . Her personality greatly improves when she actually gets to the Shattered Plains and interacts with the people there, letting the most fun part of her personality show. Kaladin , on the other hand, has an irrevocable dramatic vein . Patience. His romantic tension with Shalan does not convince me , mostly because he is absolutely odorless about this feature , in my opinion, meaning he lacks the sexuality stroke to appear to have any sense to that kind of feeling . Love seems something far beyond the Cartesian sphere of feelings where Kaladin duels . But ... I may get surprised in the next book. The other characters evolve in much better shape. The royal family grows as characters and is very well even to the point where we expect for their next chapters, even Adolin , which was particularly annoying in the previous book. The Parshendi the universe gives a whole color to the book. At first I was very hesitant , but then craved their parts , waiting to read what madness would happen over them. Great read . Novamente Brandon Sanderson entrega um livro fantástico. Apesar do Kaladin continuar o mesmo chorão do livro anterior e Shallan choramingar bastante também, os dois personagens desenvolvem muito bem suas histórias e suas habilidades. A viagem de Shallan e a evolução de sua relação com seu spren são os pontos fortes da personagem. A personalidade dela melhora bastante quando ela efetivamente chega nos Shattered Plains e começa a interagir com as pessoas de lá, e a parte mais divertida da personalidade dela começa a aparecer. Kaladin, por outro lado, tem uma veia dramática que não o larga. Paciência. A tensão romântica dele com Shalan não me convence, mas porque ele é absolutamente inodoro nessa característica, em minha opinião. Falta-lhe o traço de sexualidade para parecer ter qualquer sentido esse tipo de sentimento. Amor parece uma coisa muito além da esfera cartesiana dos sentimentos de Kaladin para funcionar para ele. Mas... vai saber. Os outros personagens evoluem de forma muito melhor. A família real cresce enquanto personagens e fica muito bem mesmo ao ponto de torcermos por seus próximos capítulos, mesmos os de Adolin, que era particularmente chato no livro anterior. O universo do Parshendi dá toda uma cor ao livro. No começo fiquei muito reticente, mas depois ansiava por suas partes, esperando para saber qual era a loucura que ocorreria no meio daquele povo.

"B00DA6YEKS","5","Great Followup","After a 3+ year hiatus, I return to Brandon Sanderon's epic fantasy world. And if any new fantasy can be considered epic, it's certainly this one. Planned at 10 books the first two are each over 1,000 pages! But don't let that scare you off. For fantasy lovers this is some serious entertainment. As I mentioned in my review of the first volume, that book possessed some (minor) structural problems partially addressed in this excellent followup. Two point of view characters (Kaladin and Shallan) dominate the narrative, and while last time the ratio was about 70/30 it's now closer to 50/50. This improvement feels more balanced. Both stories are gripping and don't let up -- during those parts I didn't want to put the book down even for a minute. There is a small percentage of the story told from the POV of other major players. While not quite as good, these at least remained in the same theatre of action. Unfortunately a few ""interludes"" with one-off stories from people all over the world remain. These stand outside the main narrative flow and are a tad annoying. As an editor I probably would have cut/shortened most -- but they aren't too long. I loved these books, but be aware this is no Game of Thrones with a fairly realistic world. It's alien. Full of strange creatures, terms, politics, magics and a dizzying and complex mythology that is as mysterious to the characters as to us. Therein lies one of Sanderson's many strengths as he doles out the answers to the mysteries at a satisfying rate without giving away the whole kit and caboodle. The writing itself is clear, confident, and polished. Not literary exactly, but quite first rate. And for a book with such a byzantine plot and titanic length, highly engaging and fast paced. There is a good amount of action and it's very well described. The powers of the Shardbearers and Surgebinders are pretty epic and you can really imagine them whirling through the air in complex battles. During the most exciting parts (usually near the end of the various ""books"" that break up the long story) the various narratives converge and alternate back and forth more rapidly in a tense and well engineered way. All and all, I'm not sure these books are for everyone as they are imaginative to an extreme, but if you like made up worlds this is one of the best. It's highly complex, well designed, elegantly plotted, well told, and just a darn fine fantasy read. Few writers have the imaginative scope required to create such an exotic beast. The Stormlight Archive harkens back to Eddings, Jordan during their glory days -- but somehow much more modern.

"B00DA6YEKS","5","A fabulous second book in the Stormlight Archive.","I have to say that I loved this book! It was so good that I couldn’t wait to get to the finish to find out what happened, while simultaneously wishing for it never to end. One of the things that kept me so enthralled was the multiple subplots. Although this book was very much Shallan’s story, it still followed the other major characters in a very satisfying way. It also introduced several more minor characters in the form of interludes. The story begins almost immediately after the conclusion in The Way of Kings. If you haven’t read the first book, then this is not the place to leap into the story – you most definitely need to start with Book One. It’s a fascinating tale, and there’s very obviously lots more of the story still to come, so now I’m starting the wait for the next volume. When you become invested in a series, the waiting time between volumes is always a funny kind of time. If, like myself, you’re a re-reader, then there’s lots to fill in the time. In addition to reading other books of course, you can re-read the parts of the series you already have, and recently, I’ve discovered that if you get them in audiobook format, you can listen to them and pick up nuances that you didn’t realise you’d missed when you read the story the first/second/third times. This story kept me enthralled from the first page to the last one. Several times as I read, I felt myself wishing to knock a few of the characters’ heads together. I was also pleased to discover that a couple of hints I’d picked up while jogging to the audiobook of “The Way of Kings” panned out almost as I’d thought might happened. (It’s always a good moment when you go “Yes! I was right!” but are still surprised by just how it all came together in the end.) The reading of this book was enhanced by the lovely artwork contained in its pages. Shallan is an artist, and many of her drawings have been beautifully depicted as part of the book. Even on my kindle, they were well imaged and clear. I’ve been a fan of Brandon Sanderson’s world building for some time now, but Roshar is probably the most well realised so far. The thought that has gone into its ecology and structure is just amazing, and those pictures and maps were just fabulous. If you’re a fan of Brandon Sanderson’s, you’ll be, at the very least, intrigued by a few of the revelations at the end of the book. If I didn’t have a book of my own to finish writing, I’d be tempted to go and do a little more reference reading.

As in the previous book, The Way of Kings, the history of one of the characters is revealed through flashback chapters, told in their own chronological order. This time, Shallan’s story is the focus. In the first book, I didn’t really get into Shallan, but I can’t say the same for this one. She gets more and more interesting, and even with all her growth in this book, there’s still plenty left for the next book. Plenty of questions and decisions. Though I must admit, Kaladin’s still my favorite character, and I love his chapters the best. Oh, and the Radiants! We finally start to piece together what happened to them. It isn’t answered, not entirely, but I’m beginning to understand it, and I love how the story’s built to let me try to figure it out. All of that leaves out the Parshendi, the enemy being fought on the Shattered Plains, but the book devotes quite a bit of time to them, revealing that they are both not as bad as they could be, but also well on their way to getting there. I found my emotions tugged in all sorts of directions regarding them. All that being said, this story is epic and full of a range of mini stories that make up the whole. At over a thousand pages, it took me nearly a month to get through it, and I’m a fast reader. Near the end, I found it harder and harder to put the book down at a reasonable hour, but after all the action was over, it still had quite a way to go. Overall, I loved this book. It was a lot of fun, featuring some interesting magic, lots of secrets meted out in small doses, and several larger than life characters that kept me engaged to the very end. I think folks who love the twists and turns and all the history and lore will likely enjoy this book. However, folks who prefer shorter, more direct reads might find this one a bit daunting.

"B00DA6YEKS","4","A Fantastic Continuation","Despite Sanderson's somewhat annoying penchant for the clichéd ""let's put two words together to make a fantasy term!"" e.g. Oathpact, oathgate, shardblade, etc., he can tell a heck of a story. ""Way of Kings"" was actually the first novel of his that I read, and though it took its sweet time really getting into the story (as the setting and cast are MASSIVE), once he'd established the main characters and started moving the plot along, I was hooked. The story is fairly complex, with many competing factions all with their own goals and motivations, and thankfully they're all believable and well thought out, though even after book two some factions' goals and motivations remain unclear. The magic systems Sanderson has created are complex, imaginative, and fairly original, and pervasive throughout the world. In addition, and to my delight, it's also almost alchemical in nature, which means it's possible for characters to approach it in a methodical, scientific way, and to understand and manipulate it to achieve previously undiscovered results. While the classic ""digging through the remains of an advanced but lost ancient civilization"" trope is in full effect, it's still unusual in that the story is set just as several of the characters have begun to unravel many of the biggest, most mysterious secrets from the lost society, and actually start figuring out not only how they work, but indeed how to improve upon them. Typically with these kinds of stories the ""secrets of the ancients"" wind up being powers or artifacts that are never really explained, but in these novels several main characters are scholars who devote themselves to understanding and working with the secrets of the ""radiants,"" which winds up being so much more satisfying than the usual deus ex machina approach to these kinds of powers and artifacts. Finally, the main characters have shown a great deal of development and depth, with some of them going through major changes that are almost shocking, but it's all done believably, and with more skill than I'd expected. I still wouldn't put the slickness with which the character development is handled on par with, say, George R.R. Martin's ""Song of Ice and Fire"" series, but considering how much longer GRRM has been writing, that's definitely not a complaint. I think that, in these novels, Sanderson has created a series that may eclipse the Wheel of Time novels by its finish. I just hope I don't have to wait another several years for the third book! Honestly, the only reason I didn't give this book five stars is that I need to leave myself somewhere to go, as, if these first two novels have been any indication, this series is only going to get better from here!","2014-03-09","United States","","true","73","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29T7GPV6NKHWJ"
"B00DA6YEKS","4","Another great entry into the Stormlight Archive!","I like most other people who are fans of Brandon Sanderson's writing sat around with a gross obsession waiting for Words of Radiance to be released. I just knew that this was going to be the king of all fantasy and that I would read the book in a matter of days and begin my brooding until the next entry comes about. Well I must say that this book while extremely long, refreshing, and very original, was also somewhat less than I expected it to be. Words of Radiance is the second book in a ten book series, which if you're reading this review you should already know all of this. As the first book focused mostly on Kaladin and bridge four, this book belongs to Shallan and introduces a few new characters in the interludes. It gives us a much better understanding of Shallan's past and sheds some light on the cause of her family's struggles. It really threw me off by how much of the book covered Shallan. Though she's an interesting character she's certainly not my favorite. But there's enough in this book to grab and hold the readers attention even if, like me, Shallan is far from your favorite character. I would highly recommend this book to anybody who has read The Way of Kings or anybody who is a fan of epic fantasy on a scale with The Wheel of Time. The first part of the book for me was somewhat slow but Sanderson fills it with enough visuals, which I must say are amazing, and comedic relief to make it easy to forget the slow pace at which a large part of the book moves along. But I would recommend sticking it out because the end of the book is where we hit pay dirt. The end is where all we have been waiting to happen comes to be. The end is what will demand you to rip your hair out waiting for the next entry. Though the book moves along somewhat slowly I must give the book four stars. I believe this is one of the fastest selling fantasy books of all time. And rightly so because what is there not to love about the world of Roshar? What is not to love about shard blades and plate? What is there not to love..... about the Knights Radiant? This is by far one of my favorite books ever and it seems it will turn into my favorite series also. So go out there and buy a copy... if you haven't read The Way of Kings go pick it up. The amount of detail put in these books is unmatched by any other and certainly lives up to the price.","2014-03-25","United States","","true","74","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HLIGS0ITN0LB"

"B00DA6YEKS","5","Best Fiction I've Ever Read","I gave myself some time after finishing this book, hoping that a little distance would make the review easier to write without sounding all gushy and fangirlish, but I'm not sure it helped much. The book is huge, both in length, scope, and importance, and there's no way my pitiful reviewing skills could come close to doing it justice. So, gushing it is. In my review of book 1, 'The Way of Kings', I said that anyone who likes fantasy should read it because it's awesome (to paraphrase). Well, I want to retract that. I now believe that even people who don't normally read fantasy should suck it up and wade through the fantasy elements because it's just that stinking good. I loved book 1. LOVED it. And now that I've finished book two, I almost feel like book 1 was just a warm up. I still loved it, but when compared with this one… It's worth it, people. It's worth stepping out of your norm and into the world of Kaladin, Shallan, and Dalinar. Open your brain to spren and Shardplate. Take the time to immerse yourself in a fantasy that shows a pointed reflection of our reality. So many things that I assumed were simple fantasy elements in book 1 turned out to be integral to the world and story in book 2, fitting everything together in a fantastic, seriously epic set of intertwining tales. And many, many times I laughed loudly, surprised by hilarious dialogue and a couple of awkward moments. The humor was a perfect balance for the more serious themes and dire situations. I was cheering aloud during several scenes. How could I not? I feel like I know these people personally. Not only was the reader in me impressed beyond any expectation (which is saying a lot. I might have mentioned that I loved book 1), the writer in me was inspired to do far greater and bigger than I'd ever considered before. Not that I would presume to ever reach this level of awesomeness, but I can aspire to it. Violence: Of course. Sexual Content: Nope. Foul Language: Sort of. They say 'damnation' and use an impolite designation for a man conceived during an affair. Overall Message/Plot: I've already said it. I can't recommend this book any more highly. After much serious thought, I can say that this is the best fiction I have ever read. I'm looking forward to reading it all over again before book 3 comes out so it'll be fresh in my mind.

"B00DA6YEKS","5","The most epic of the epic fantasies","This is the second book of the Stormlight Archives. I expected an epic, sweeping story from Words of Radiance and I was not disappointed. This is the kind of epic fantasy that I dream of. Engaging, deep characters, a masterfully complex and rich world, magic that is both massive and constrained, and a mystery that is not going to be explained with a simple sentence. Sanderson does not spare you the details. He spends a lot of time inside a character's head letting you experience the world through their eyes and their perceptions. You get to feel what they feel. Sanderson generally does not use narrative to explain a whole lot about the world. The reader has to figure it out by what the character experiences. The reader is also not given a lot of hints about the world outside of what the characters know, so you're trying to figure things out along with the character. To me, this makes for great story telling. This is not a story for those with short attention spans or for somebody who prefers simple, action-oriented characters. It is epic fantasy and is therefore somewhat of a slow burn. I expect that 90% of the negative reviews that you'll see about this book are that there isn't enough happening, or there isn't enough action. I would disagree with that. There is plenty throughout the story, but it is epic fantasy; there's a lot of stuff happening that isn't about action. Some people don't have a taste for that. Sanderson does keep the tension up, and there are always important things happening, but the pacing did feel a bit slow at times. However, as I noticed that the pacing seemed a bit slow, I'd also realize that I had been reading for two hours and it only felt like a fraction of that time. This is a 1,000 page book. There's a lot of story here. I like that because it gives me the chance to fully immerse myself in the story for a long, long time. Events happen in this book that are important and move the characters along in their progressions nicely. However, do not expect any kind of overall resolution to the story here. That's not going to happen. It leaves you wanting the next book right now, though. That's a bit frustrating because it hasn't been written yet. The only reason for the frustration is because this story and the story telling is so darned good that you just want to keep reading on and on.","2014-03-19","United States","","true","78","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39E6INWG44SPL"

"B00DA6YEKS","5","lOVE!","Brandon Sanderson is a gift …Such good build-up of narration, characters that pull you in its a joy to read. I definitely feel though there are some inconsistencies with the Shallan character and her relationship with Adolin. Many things she did were given justifications and she never really was held to account. Also the idea of making things ‘fit’ for those two seems to have been a driving part of the narrative rather than what seems natural based on the way she’s developed. I would’ve expected there to be a bond and understanding with her and Kaladin .. it was kind of frustrating because she seems to have a willful blind spot/prejudice with seeing below the surface with Kaladin .. however I think this may be an example of Brandon having a vested interest in an outcome and making things fit with Adolin for now, which stood out to me because he is so good at letting the characters progress in a way that feels natural everywhere else. I hope this works itself around to a more satisfying resolution in the end. lol I’m invested!","2024-06-16","United States","","true","80","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTG7OD4MFUC7L"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","A radiant book","I have to admit, I'm a bit of a fan of Brandon Sanderson. I absolutely loved The Way of Kings, I can honestly say that Kaladin is my favorite fantasy character of all time, and so I was very hyped for this book, especially considering such great reviews it has been getting. It's happened to me an awful lot of times that I end up dissapointed because of having so high expectations, and so I waited a long time before reading this one, even though I was dying to, just out of some strange fear of ending up dissapointed. In case you had the same fears, trust me, you can put them to rest now. Words of radiance is just a magnificent book. It surpasses its predecessor in every possible way, and that's saying something. The characters are just amazing, they grow over the story and you understand their rationale and their personalities better, and you can't help but feel attached to them, to be identified with their fears, their troubles, their dreams. And the story is just awesome! If you liked The Way of Kings, well, you will absolutely love this one! You have to keep in mind that this is the second of a supposed ten book series, so the world is just beggining to open up now. That being said, everything makes more sense and begins to come into place in this book. There were several elements in The Way of Kings that were hard to understand, but that you will come to once you begin reading this book. And there are also several other elements in this book that make the world and the story more complex. I'm pretty sure that by the time we reach the middle of the series, this will probably be regarded by many (myself included, hopefully) as the greatest fantasy series of this generation. So yes, I've got a lot of faith in Brandon. I wish I can make some readers give this series a try. I'm one for reading and considering reviews for series I'd like to try, so hopefully people that do the same will be encouraged by sooooo many positive reviews, including this one. Obviously, you have to read The Way of Kings first if you haven't, which is a great book as well. If you already did, then by all means get this book now. You will not regret it, that much I can guarantee.","2015-03-16","United States","","true","81","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26QWO3CPV7QE9"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","A whirlwind of a read.","I love puzzles. I always have. There is an excitement and a sense of fulfillment that comes with piecing together tiny fragments to reveal a greater whole. This is where Sanderson is a master--he weaves together narrative in a way that gradually builds, piece by piece, before revealing that each tiny piece falls together seamlessly into the larger pattern. ""Words of Radiance"", the second book in the Stormlight Archive, might be Brandon Sanderson's finest example of this mastery yet. I first discovered Sanderson through the ""Wheel of Time"" series he completed for the late Robert Jordan. Appreciating his writing style, I went on to read the ""Mistborn"" trilogy and was blown away. Dystopian society brimming on the edge of revolt? Check. Strange and mysterious setting that seems alien to the reader? Check. Detailed and well-developed magic system that is wholly original and well, really cool? Check. Check. Check. I was hooked. I began reading the Stormlight Archive series with both excitement and trepidation. Could Sanderson capture the same magic and quality in this new series he so easily encapsulated in the Mistborn books? In short...hell yes he could. ""Words of Radiance"", the second book in the Stormlight Archive series, expertly shows off Sanderson's penchant for well-crafted and unique magic systems as well as his streamlined, clear, yet expansive writing style. The characters are full of quirks, flaws, and qualities that continue to endear themselves to the reader. My biggest hope for this series is that Sanderson can continue to grow his characters without falling into the ""larger-than-life"" trope so many characters in epic fantasy inevitably fall into. Without giving anything away, the setting for the Stormlight Archive novels is well thought out, detailed and huge in scale across both distance and time. The book flows nicely with plenty of build up to the final reveal without losing the reader or growing boring along the way. In other words, you can expect to put your life on hold for a couple of days while you plow your way through this 1000+ page-turner. But don't take my word for it, go ahead and let the first few pages pull you in to the storm. Just don't forget to hunker down, find a comfy chair and put on a full pot of coffee. You'll need it.","2015-01-23","United States","","true","82","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JK80J9VM063X"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","Fabulous Follow-up to The Way of Kings","It's taken me some time to get into Brandon Sanderson, I'll admit. After some hesitation about trying his work, I finally downloaded the first book of The Stormlight Archive, THE WAY OF KINGS, when I joined Audible. It clocked in as an over 45 hour audiobook, and as beautiful as the world-building is, that's a long book to listen to. Then I was sucked in and wanted more. For WORDS OF RADIANCE, I chose the ebook and read it on a long plane ride to South America. The details of Sanderson's created world are simply breathtaking, and at this point I'm completely entranced by the characters. I'm not a fan of grimdark, but I do sometimes enjoy a solid epic fantasy so long you could knock an elephant out with the print edition, and WORDS OF RADIANCE fits the bill. The action is great, and Sanderson has some interesting and complex female characters. Romantic scenes, on the other hand, are not his strong point, although the love banter is a little better done than it was in THE WAY OF KINGS. This book's ending does feel a little rushed, and I found that Sanderson's notes in the beginning on his writing process explains why. The book came out much longer than he intended (not exactly a surprise), and he was under some time pressure. This section also relates the team of people who help him keep his elaborate fantasy world details consistent over the course of the story, and it's fascinating to read about his creative process. I like Sanderson's work for many reasons. Heroes are flawed and complex in his work, but they are heroes, and I didn't have to spend a hundred pages in the head of a sociopath, or endure chapter after chapter of women being brutalized, unlike other modern epic fantasy I've tried to read. The worldbuilding is truly spectacular, with a fully realized planet where the geology and biology has realistically impacted human culture. At the same time, I really cared about the characters and the plot was completely absorbing despite all the backstory. The book has an average level of violence for the genre, and really no sex to speak of. Young adult fantasy fans who want a more substantial read should like it, and lovers of complex and sweeping epic fantasy will love it. Highly recommended, and I can't wait until the third book!","2016-04-23","United States","","true","83","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JLX5ZOR7R0UZ"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","This is shaping up to be an important fantasy series.","Sanderson has hooked me. I've been hesitant about declaring myself to officially be a ""fan"" of his, since every time I've done so in the past, the writer has gone on to taunt us with poorly constructed, filler novels (Jordan, Goodkind) and/or rest on his laurels and decide to make an over-hyped and pedestrian television series his focus (Martin). I have been deeply concerned that Sanderson would disappoint me. Now granted, this is only the 2nd novel in this series, but I'm too floored with this story to avoid enthusiasm anymore. One of the troubling parts about any character-driven series like this is the author's inevitable love-affair with their protagonists. Too often we find our main characters to be blank canvases with few (or often poorly crafted) characteristics to make them unique. We're supposed to be able to transpose ourselves onto them for a more immersive experience. Unfortunately, it usually leads to dull or boring protagonists and antagonists that are much more interesting with much more pathos. Case in point, Martin's Jon Snow and Danearys Targaryen compared to Jaime and Cersei Lannister. The latter are SIGNIFICANTLY more interesting. Sanderson deftly avoids this pitfall with Kaladin and Shallan. We are given wonderfully rich depth into both of these characters (Kaladin more in the last book, Shallan in this one) and neither comes across as immediately ""likable"". They are both flawed and struggling with growth evident between the first pages and the last. It makes for a very satisfying journey, much like the previous novel. Best of all, Sanderson gives a complete story in these pages. There are no corny cliffhangers or half-told story arcs. This is a stand-alone novel, in my opinion, with a contained plot. It segues nicely at the end, alluding to an elevated conflict with higher stakes. I wouldn't go so far as to say that the uninitiated can pick this one up without having read the predecessor, but it comes close with only some minor details about political conflict and Surgebinding mechanics required for a fuller appreciation. He's done it. He's written an outstanding sequel in an outstanding series. I genuinely do believe that this series of books is building to become an important series for the fantasy sub genre as a whole, and possibly a defining work in Sanderson's already impressive career.","2014-03-11","United States","","true","84","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IMNXHNWFXWSO"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","Great despite flaws","4.5/5 stars I love this world and these characters. They live and breathe in a way that is utterly compelling. I also love Sanderson's transparent writing style, which allows the story to flourish by making the language all but disappear from consciousness. Because of these strengths, I found the overall read highly enjoyable, despite a few flaws. I didn't find this installment in the series quite as emotionally engaging as the first. The Way of Kings had more gut-wrenching lows, which made the pay-off of the highs even more fulfilling. It was always going to be tough to live up to the first book, since the bar was set so incredibly high, so I wasn't too disappointed that Words of Radiance fell a bit short of that high mark. Perhaps my biggest issue with Words of Radiance was Kaladin's choices leading up to his big inner conflict toward the end of the book. These choices seemed totally out of character to me. The resulting moral dilemma felt manufactured and forced, undermining the emotional impact of his story arc. I felt this was a significant enough flaw to justify a 0.5 star deduction in the rating. I liked that Words of Radiance focused a bit more on Shallan's character. My interest in her continued to grow throughout the book. While Sanderson's use of flashbacks to help solve the mystery of why Shallan is who she is works (though perhaps not as well here as it did for Kaladin in The Way of Kings) I do hope he moves on to explore other methods for accomplishing this in future sequels, since this approach is starting to feel formulaic. I also hope that the all-too-predictable love triangle takes a shardblade to the spine before it devolves into some sort of nauseating Edward vs. Jacob parody. Words of Radiance could have benefited from a few nips and tucks. Some portions of the book bogged down just a bit, where more courageous editing could have resulted in a tighter finished product. While I've chosen to highlight a few minor complaints, I want to make clear that I believe this book deserves all of the plaudits it has received. These few flaws are easily overwhelmed by the more positive aspects of Words of Radiance explored in other reviews.","2014-04-03","United States","","true","85","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OY3PD45AVOEX"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","Radiant Of Words/In Glory Rise/Writing/Rise Glorious/ In Words Of Radiance","SPOILERS!!! In Words of Radiance, we see the work of a true Wordsmith, one who can take raw Idea and shape it into a phenomenal matrix of living story. 1. Shallan. Some complained about this book's increased focus on Shallan as against Kaladin, but I thought Brandon handled that transition startingly well. At the beginning of the book, Shallan is only a shy scholar, but by the end we see her become a true Lightweaver, one who takes lies and makes of them tools to reshape truth. Not since Breeze of Scadriel have we seen someone who so deeply understands the right and wrong use of manipulation. 2. Kaladin. In the first book, Kaladin had to conquer despair, maintaining courage and will in the face of hopelessness. But now he must fight the far more insidious enemy of vengeance. For better than half the book, he flirts with the idea of the means justifying the ends, as he seeks to overcome his bitter hatred of the lighteyes. But eventually he learns that if he is to be a Windrunner, he must ""protect even those he hates, so long as it is just"". And that realization brings about one of the most supremely amazing scenes in all literature, as he shows the world just what a Windrunner can do. 3. Lift. Lift is Awesome. Despite having been ten for only three years, this young girl has bonded a spren, and become an Edgedancer. Coupled with her ability to turn food into pure Awesomeness, she gives us one of the most memorable interludes of all the series. 4. Eshonai. From her first appearance, Eshonai is one of the most tragic characters. Fighting desperately to keep her people alive in the face of the Alethi's unrelenting assault, Eshonai discovers that her sister may have unlocked stormform. This form will grant great power, but at the risk of bringing back the Old Gods of the Listeners. In desperation, she volunteers to try this new form on herself, but finds her mind taken over by a sliver of Elemental Hatred. 5. Adolin. Though Adolin has yet to visibly manifest any Surgebinding powers, his remarkable skill with the Blade gives him a few moments of true heroism. In addition, his budding romantic relationship with Shallan is both funny and incredibly sweet. I wish them both all happiness.","2014-03-15","United States","","true","86","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RICL5MNZ3ZJY5"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","26 Hours of Almost Constant Reading - And you know what? It was worth it.","So we have all waited for this book for years, over which time the expectations just grew. But Brandon has created his own unique brand of addicting writing: as soon as you open the Words of Radiance you plunge in to this world very much like Shallan falls into the realm with the distant sun. There is a time-bomb ticking from the beginning creating a faster paced narrative than we got used to in the previous Way of Kings. And this time all the characters are taken by the same current, their collision unavoidable. And it is one of the best parts of the book! For a 1000 pages we have read their stories, we have come to love them and now it was time for them to meet. And boy they do! I enjoyed those parts the most where Dalinar Shallan and Khaladin get to spend time together and slowly discover each other's abilities. Shallan's story just gets some much more exciting and gives her lots of depth but it is still Khaladin who engaged me the most. He doesn't simply accept his role as the male protagonist of the series. He is brooding depressed and uncertain once more. And why shoulnd't he be? With his new power come new responsibilities and possibilities that he has to grow into. But the development of his character is completely in sync with the story. When he finally realizes what needs to be done tears and screams of joy are in due. The storm has come. If you read the book you will see anyway. None of the reviews mentions it, but I found the chapters in which Khaladin and Shallan get to know each other and ""go on a hike"" particurarly entertaining. In the Mistborn series the love interest was sometimes a bit awkward but in Words of Radiance I found myself smiling and laughing while reading these scenes. It seems somehow natural that they would be drawn to each other. Shallan's involvement with Adolin only adds more depth to all of the characters as we grow to even like him. However it was kind of a disappointment when our two heroes don't have an ending scene in the last chapters. What do you think?

"B00DA6YEKS","4","Plenty of great series can be counted as essentially one book","Sometimes it takes me a while to gain momentum reading a book, but not the case with this one. I was supposed to be reading something else, in fact, but I thought I'd just peak at it. And then I was hooked. It picks up right where The Way of Kings leaves off, without slowing down. There was a little bit of rehashing but he didn't let it bog things down too much. Do people really pick up middle books in series often enough for this to be necessary? I've heard people say that books in a series should be able to stand on their own, but that has never been a concern of mine at all. Plenty of great series can be counted as essentially one book, most famous example being Lord of the Rings. This book focused on Shallan's past, as the previous one focused on Kaladin's. Shallan's history was more heartbreaking than Kaladin's, to me. I had some ideas and guesses about it, but the story still managed to surprise me. Several completely unexpected events happened in this book, and I'm very interested in seeing what the ramifications of them will be. I don't think this is a huge spoiler, but it's a minor one. I'm going to compare this, favorably, against Song of Ice and Fire at this point, in which characters spend entire books headed somewhere but never arrive, where fans wait for a payoff, to see certain characters meet, and it never happens. People get places in this book. People meet and it is awesome. There were some frustrations in this book for me. I felt like Kaladin spent the majority of the book being stupid. I knew he was bound to eventually stop, but it was frustrating waiting for him to come around to his senses. I'm not sure about some of Shallan's choices either, for that matter, but I can't say for sure that she's wrong. She just makes a lot of decisions that make me very nervous for her. The end of this book felt a little cheesy. Very high powered. Some people would not like this, I think. I'm ambivalent about it, but I consider the series well worth it for the complex cast of characters and their development.","2016-01-22","United States","","true","90","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17T9FIACJ0ARY"

"B00DA6YEKS","5","An Immersion in Otherland","This is a massive volume. This may produce some apprehension about whether it is worth the time investment to read this. Of course, if you are considering this book, you’ve already invested nearly as much time reading book one, and the short answer to this question is, yes, it’s worth the time, the reward is commensurate with the effort. This book is very tightly plotted. Bits and pieces that seem minor and unrelated in the early sections show up later as significant pieces to the entire puzzle of this created world. This applies not just to the murky, mainly unknown history of this world, but to each of the major characters, pieces that round each character out, make them real and full-bodied. Unlike some other major fantasy epics, many of these characters are out-and-out heroes (although they are heroes that can fall off their pedestals), the presence of which I think is one of the reasons many people read fantasy as opposed to other genres of literature. The characters do change and evolve over the course of this volume, and there is quite a verisimilitude of different character types, all adding to the general satisfaction of reading a story that feels real, regardless of just how different this world is from the mundane world we live in. While not everything has a resolution in this volume, a great deal is resolved and answered, so you don’t feel cheated by cliffhangers and threads left hanging, very refreshing in a planned multi-book series. The climax of this book is truly climactic; major events do happen in stellar fashion, worthy of Hollywood blockbuster treatment. And there is a certain amount of philosophizing happening within these pages, questions about the purpose of life and how you live it that add substance to this story. About the only negative I had with this is that I wanted more description of the scenery, especially those sections not set on the Shattered Plains. There were some sections where I just couldn’t quite place myself in the local environ because of this. This is a minor quibble; after all, the thing is already a thousand pages. An absorbing read, worth the effort. ---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)","2014-10-14","United States","","true","92","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGGLVEYN8BS8S"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","Lives up to the first book","If you haven't read Way of Kings yet, stop now and go read it. If you have and you didn't like it - What are you crazy? but if you really didn't like it, you won't like this one either. On the other hand, if you're like me and you enjoyed every page of the first book, each page driving you to keep going, wanting to get a few more pages at night before you turned out the lights, then my friend your prayers have been answered. Sanderson is at his best in this series and this book carries that torch and lets it shine. I devoured this book. I bought both the physical and digital copies. I thought upon opening the package containing my dead tree version that such an immense tome would take me a week or two to read, but no! It was over too soon. I was sucked in. I could not put this book down. I read with a hunger I have rarely felt since my childhood. I wanted to know more about the characters, the world, and the story. I wanted to know more about the new magic system. What is possible in this world? Many of my questions would be answered, but new questions arose and now I await the third volume eagerly. I do have 3 points of criticism for the book: 1- I'm not a fan of the interlude pieces. The entire time I read those, I wanted to get back to the main characters. That said, I hope that they have more pivotal roles than it seems and that there's a reason for including them. 2- Did I mention that I couldn't put the book down? Really, I had no life from the time I started reading until I finished it. 3- and this is the big one - I have to wait for book three. Waiting really is the hardest part. Perhaps it's good that I will see the sun a few times before I get to see this book, but every time I start a series I tell myself I'll wait until it's done, but for some reason I never seem to follow through. Anyway, enjoy the book, it's well worth reading for the fantasy aficionado.","2014-03-11","United States","","true","93","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BLM3JFLG5SSA"

"B00DA6YEKS","4","Not as good as the first but still excellent","The must-read sequel to the amazing Way of Kings. Sanderson is an amazing writer who proves again why he is probably the pre-eminent world-building fantasy author writing today. Words of Radiance focuses more so on the story and background of Shallan in the same way that Way of Kings focused on telling the story of Kaladin. Overall I think Words of Radiance is not as action oriented as the first book in the series. Sanderson spends a lot more time on life and events on the Shattered Planes and everything else is secondary. A lot of time is spent on the the politics between the high princes and the Dalinar's efforts to bind them together into one army. Unlike in the first book, I found myself skimming through the Interludes trying to get back to the main story more quickly and it was harder for me to tie to the interludes back to the main plot. Sanderson does advance the plot and in doing so answers a lot of the questions posed in both Way of Kings and the sequel. My main disappointment was the ending which I found to be all too convenient and miraculous... it reminded me a little bit of the end of the Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull movie where the events got a bit too unbelievable. Most of the Stormlight Archive has been pretty grounded in that the events that happened were relatively believable when taking into account this is a fantasy land where there is a mythology and magic does exist. However I feel that Sanderson relied too much on what I will call ""miracles"" towards the end of the book rather than spending the time to fully develop events. It seemed like he was in a rush to get the book done and all of the characters ready for the next book without adding another 200 pages. It all felt a bit rushed. I noticed this same trend in the otherwise amazing finale for the Wheel of Time series. Sanderson is a very talented author who has reached the status that I will read anything with his name on it or if he thinks it is good. Words of Radiance has done nothing to change that.","2014-04-04","United States","","true","96","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRXGYDY6X80PC"
"B00DA6YEKS","4","Just as good as the first.","At the beginning of this book I was worried that it would not be as good because of main character. However her story line was very interesting and still gave me enough of everyone else. I can't wait for the next one!!!","2024-09-20","United States","","true","97","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9JVMEUBTZP1T"
"B00DA6YEKS","4","Very entertaining but slightly uneven","Let me preface this by saying that I loved both Words of Radiance and The Way of Kings. However, I found The Way of Kings to be a notch above this in some areas, while this book was better in others. This time around the ending felt oddly rushed, while the buildup to it felt overly extended. Kaladin's arc remains in neutral, in my opinion, for the latter part of the book, which takes away from the pacing. That said, the fight scenes are just as thrilling in this one as they were the first time around. We finally get a long awaited showdown between Kaladin and Szeth and it does not disappoint one bit! Sanderson's writing easily places you into the pages, and the sight of Kaladin and Szeth dancing about would be mesmerizing. Still, and this is just my opinion, but the emotional punch of the climactic battle this time around was not as great as that of Bridge 4 rallying to save the trapped Kholin men. As others have mentioned however, I don't find all characters to be equally interesting. Kaladin is a favourite of mine, while I found Shallan's chapters to be a bit lacking. Thus, the book being so heavily focused on Shallan, made it slightly less enjoyable for me. I did enjoy her chapters more in this book than the first one, and her flashbacks were interesting, but some of her chapters dragged on a bit. As mentioned earlier, while Kaladin's chapters were interesting, his arc seemed to stall, which also took away from the enjoyment. On the other hand, Dalinar's story was engrossing and kept me entertained. Overall, the writing and world building was much better this time around. I have focused on the flaws in my review but please note that if you had even a passing interest in the first book, you will love this one. Slight pacing and character preferences notwithstanding, this is another great entry into the Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson, is now one of the series I am most invested in (along with A Song of Ice and Fire). If you loved Shallan, you will love this book. The fight scenes are still top notch, and I can't wait to see what happens next. Highly recommended.","2014-05-18","United States","","true","98","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18PAIM9YQO9"
"B00DA6YEKS","5","Great read","I love so many of these characters. I love that they all feel unique in terms of thought processes, life experience, and biases. Like don't get me wrong the story is great but the characters are what draw me. Sanderson does a good job of fleshing out and making you love these people. Characters I wrote off as ok in book one have really grown on me. My favorite bits are getting the characters we have been following interact and work together. Or butt heads.","2024-09-30","United States","","true","99","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JK8XNCVYLO6J"
