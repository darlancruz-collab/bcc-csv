"B003P2WO5E","5","Do yourself a favor - Don't start this book!","I made a very unusual, very serious mistake in reading this book. The series is not finished, and likely won't be for... oh many years yet. Typically, I make sure that a series is complete before I start it. Not so in this case, and boy was I disappointed to find out that it's actually an in-process event. Nevertheless. This book is fantastic. Incredibly well written, with unusual and well thought out world building, it engages from the very first. Unlike some other epic fantasy series, like the Malazan Book of the Fallen, for example, the story takes off from the beginning. In the Malazan series, the reader is thrown immediately into the action but in a way that made me wonder at first if I missed something and started on Book 2. It was difficult to keep up with the characters at times and hard to understand exactly what was going on; though I still count the Malazan series among my favorites of all time. This series distinguishes itself by keeping the cast of characters fairly simple. Don't get me wrong: there is a plethora of interesting characters here, but we spend enough time with them to really get to understand them, and the way they are organized (with specific chapters of perspective) keeps it logical and allows the reader to flow from one perspective to the next without any disturbance. We don't know just yet, since this is the first in a ten book series, how exactly these characters will all come together - but we know they will. As with most of the great fantasy novels, these are characters that are difficult to assign a simple ""good"" vs. ""evil"" description - they all seem to have a little of both. The world building and the magic is phenomenal. The descriptions of all of the plant life makes me see this world as one that is constantly filled with movement: almost as if the flora has been moved from underwater to above ground. The illustrations throughout help the reader to visualize some of these descriptions, and are really well done (though it's hard to read some of the notes on the illustrations on my Kindle - in this case, a hard copy may be better). The non-human creatures are inventive and original. The use of magic - the stormlight - is incredibly unique and captivating. I find myself holding my breath as they breathe in the stormlight... haha! I'm in love with Kaladin's character, and I keep thinking ""please don't kill him off, please don't kill him off..."" :) One other note: I've read Sanderson's Mistborn series and while I thoroughly enjoyed that, it seems that the Stormlight Archive is so far beyond the Mistborn books with regard to quality that it almost seems like they were written by two different people. If I had to nitpick to find any negatives about this book (very hard to do), it would be the form of cursing used. It didn't take long for me to be annoyed with phrases like ""Storm it!"" and ""Storm you!"" and ""That's storming idiotic!"". This seems to be a common problem I have with most fantasy novels, though. I just wish they'd stick to normal cursing. But like I said, this is an extreme nitpick and really the only negative thing I could think of. Love, love, love this book and hope I don't have to wait TOO long before #3 comes out. **ETA: I alluded to this above, but one point should be underlined: the Kindle version will NOT do justice to the illustrations in this book (and the next). If you don't want to get the full effect by buying a hard copy version, you can check out Brandon Sanderson's website for the illustrations. I highly suggest you do this, as the color in some of the pictures changes everything. **ETA: I actually forgot to mention something I feel is very important. While the rest of the series won't be published for a while, I really do appreciate that Sanderson has left the series (and now I'm really talking more of the second book rather than the first but felt it appropriate to include here) on a good note. While there are of course unanswered questions, and we as readers want to know what happens to all of these folks and how they come together, it still has the sense of a complete ending. I love that he didn't really end with a cliff hanger, at least as far as the action is concerned, and we are not stuck in frustration for the duration. It left me feeling satisfied with the ending, while maintaining my curiosity about the future of this world. On a similar note, I also appreciate that the beginning of the second book wasn't TOO much of a recap of the first. I really hate it when a book within a series repeats the previous books as if the reader is picking up with that version - it just seems a little condescending. I like that the author assumes (as he should) that the reader has already waded through the history prior to arriving at the present and only includes brief references as appropriate. Thank you, Mr. Sanderson, for that.","2014-06-02","United States","","true","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CEW1YYS1OZZY"
"B003P2WO5E","5","Awesome epic fantasy","It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a good epic fantasy. The operative word being ""enjoyed."" The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson may have been over 1,000 pages long, but it didn't read like it. He's one of my favorite authors - I've read Elantris 7 or 8 times by itself - and I'd been looking forward to this book for some time. The main storyline revolves around the war sparked when the black-and-red-skinned Parshendi assassinated the Alethi King. Ten years after the war began, it has devolved into a competition between the Alethi princes for the gemstone hearts of the giant crustacean-like monsters who inhabit the battlefield. Only one of the princes, the Brightlord Dalinar Kholin, sees a problem with this, but his nightmarish visions of the end of the world have alienated him from his peers and made his judgment suspect. The plot was incredible complex, mostly following the stories of several main characters: a former soldier turned slave, forced to labor under the infamous ""bridge crews"" who are essentially human shields to protect the real warriors from enemy arrows. A thief masquerading as a scholar to steal a priceless magical artifact and save her family. A paranoid young king who sees assassination plots in even his most trusted of advisors. An enslaved assassin with the ability to manipulate the forces of gravity who despises the murderous acts his masters force him to commit. A spren - largely unintelligent, fairy-like creatures attuned to very specific elements like pain, wind, or glory - who is becoming sentient as the human she is fixated with grows back his soul. All the worldbuilding is detailed and very well done, but it does make for a somewhat slow start. So if you mean to dive into it, bring your patience.There was a good amount of repetition throughout the book; for example, I lost count of how many times Sanderson repeated that the Parshendi were not the same creatures as the enslaved parshmen, even though they looked exactly alike. I kept waiting for that to become relevant, but it didn't - at least in this book. There isn't much action for it being 1,000 pages long, and, as it is apparently the first novel in an anticipated 10-novel-long series, nothing is really wrapped up by the end. It's a thousand pages long, but at the end you feel like nothing's happened yet. That being said, it was brilliantly written and engaging, I cared about all of the characters, and it read very quickly despite its length. I'm definitely going to read the next one even if it's 2,000 pages. The world itself was staggering in scope but not so unfamiliar that it alienated the reader; humans are humans and dogs are dogs, although most other life forms seem to be giant crustaceans (which is actually kinda cool; the last time I encountered any kind of giant crustacean was in Stephen King's The Drawing of the Three). Each nation was well-crafted and explored, and each vastly different that the last. One nation is plagued by 'Highstorms' so powerful that they whip building-sized boulders through the air likfe confetti and the plants themselves have learned how to move out of the way. Another is filled with creatures who consider all forms of stone holy. I could go on for a long, long time about this book. But if you enjoy epic fantasy, you'll enjoy this. I really liked it, and I'll probably read it again just before the next book comes out.","2011-09-14","United States","","true","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R272A5U1I6WYJX"
"B003P2WO5E","4","A solid debut for Sanderon's new fantasy series","""The Way of Kings"" is the first novel of Brandon Sanderson's ""Stormlight Archive"", a planned ten-book series as well as his magnum opus. Combining many traditional epic fantasy tropes with Sanderson's unique setting (as well as his talent for fast-paced execution), this novel is both a good read, and a welcome addition to the fantasy genre. The novel is set in the fictional world of Rosher, on a continent that is frequently ravaged by brutal storm fronts called ""highstorms"". It centers around three primary protagonists (as well as a handful of minor characters with few chapters): Kaladin (the main character), Shallan, and Dalinar. Kaladin is a surgical-student-turned-soldier-turned-slave, who spends most of the book fighting for survival as a ""bridgeman"" (a near suicidal mission involving the placement of unprotected bridges under a hail of enemy arrows). Shallan is a young ""lighteyes"" woman (the equivalent of a noblewoman), who is carrying out a desperate heist in the guise of a scholarly apprenticeship. Dalinar is an aging lord and the late King of Alethkar's brother, who is seeking vengeance for his assassination while being wracked with visions from the past. This book is a gigantic page-turner. Even with more than 1000 pages (long even by fantasy standards), it's an absolute breeze to read, and very difficult to put down. As is typical for Sanderson, the prose is fairly straight-forward and easy, with little ambiguity and difficulty in interpretation. It does occasionally slow down due to the frequent flashbacks, but they integrate relatively well into the narrative. Much of the book encompasses traditional fantasy tropes executed well. Kaladin is cast into a desperate situation in which he tries to avoid despair, but there's little question that he will manage to find a way out of it. Shallan's storyline is also fairly predictable, although Sanderson throws in a bit of a twist at the end that reveals a good deal about the setting (Shallan's arc, in general, is frequently used for expository purposes). The least predictable section of the story is that of Dalimar's, although he unfortunately has the least dynamic character of the three. All of this is interwoven with considerable action, lots of battles described in detail, and a good deal of magic. What makes the book truly different are two elements: the setting, and the magic system (an odd system including ""lashing"", a type of gravity manipulation). Sanderson seems to be carving himself a niche in world-building with the type of naturally ravaged world he creates with Rosher - the closest comparison to it is the ash-choked world of his previous fantasy series, the ""Mistborn"" Trilogy. He goes into a good amount of detail describing the unique creatures and plants that have arisen in the world, including hard-shelled crustaceans on land, as well as protected, retracting plants in a world where any topsoil is simply swept away. The only weakness is in the society that Sanderson portrays, which comes across as more of your typical european-style fantasy world than the type you might expect to evolve in such a world. All of this adds to the imagery of the novel, and none of it slows the pace down (as you might expect such detail to do). While enjoyable, ""The Way of Kings"" is not without its weaknesses. One of them lies in the same element discussed earlier as a strength: its predictability. After stripping away the unique world and magic, this is a very typical fantasy novel in many ways. There is little doubt that Kaladin, Dalimar, and Shallan will overcome their hardships, and while they take the reader on an interesting ride, none of them are truly unique, difficult, or memorable characters. If you're looking for such characters, this may not be the novel for you. There are two other concerns. One is the almost-total lack of overt sexuality, either implied or shown. Sanderson does throw in a mention of a prostitute or several, and the celibacy of the characters makes sense in-story, but it does affect the tone and characterization in a way that makes the book occasionally feel like a ""young adult"" novel. The other is the use of terminology: Sanderson occasionally uses terms and descriptions that don't really seem to fit the knowledge and perception of the viewpoint character, and it would sometimes pull me out of the story. Nonetheless, this is a solid fantasy novel, and one of the best releases of 2010. I strongly recommend it to any fantasy fans, as well as readers interested in a fast-paced, occasionally dark beginning to a new series.","2010-09-07","United States","","true","4","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZX8H642GBTCY"
"B003P2WO5E","5","Best Epic Of All Time","There's SO MUCH to say about this book... If I were to write everything I want to say about this work, I would spend days here. I will try and be short for once. First of all, I think I should mention I had NEVER read anything from Brandon Sanderson before, and I am quite sure I couldn't have found a better start. I first discovered who Brandon was when watching Geek and Sundry's ""The Storyboard"". I got into it because I'm a huge fan of Pat Rothfuss', but then a guy showed up. He looked a lot like myself, and he was just SO funny! I thought to myself ""Why not?"". Then I came to Amazon and saw ""The Stormlight Archive"" for about $3,00. ""Wut? 1k pages for 3 bucks? I'm in!"". Here in Brazil, a 1k pages book would cost around 40~70 dollars. Kelek provide Kindle a long existance. Thank you. So, the book starts with a guy. A guy named Kalak. He is standing before a huge thunderclast, which is a creature made of stone and fire. There are dead bodies everywhere. Kalak has died many times. Many, many times. But this time he has survived. He, and other eight have survived. Only one of the 10 died this time. This Desolation was bad, but they survived. And they were supposed to go back. Go back to a place of fire and pain. But... Why? What if he just... didn't go? Where are the others?, he asked the King of Heralds. They are gone. The Oathpact is finished. If you're going, leave your Blade. And Kalak leaves his Blade. And he goes away. After an awesome prologue, the story jumps four thousand and five hundred years in the future, and we meet Szeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, who's about to kil a king. He wears white on the day he was to kill a king. And then we are presented to the concept of Stormlight. And we learn about Lashings. And we learn about Shardblades and Shardplates. And we get mesmerized by how marvelously Sanderson's writing is. His prose is crystal clear. The way he WEAVES the story before our eyes, using concepts we have never encountered before to create something plausible, belieavable, is just astounding. Szeth is one of the most marvelous characters I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. BUT, he is by no means the ""main"" character of the book. In fact, he appears only sporadically. After Szeth, we meet Kaladin. If there is a main character in this work, it is Kaladin. The character is complex. In fact, the story is complex. It is so complex, actually, that I've had trouble going through the first chapters. Everything is so REAL, so DETAILED, that we find ourselves in a new world, meeting new people, and a new way of life. There are rockbuds and axelhounds and chulls and chasmfiends and fabrials and ardents and parshmen and Parshendi and Alethi and... Well, it's a whole new world, really. It is one of the MOST MAGNIFICENT worlds I have ever had the pleasure to ""be in"". But it's a hard read at first. It is not hard because it is bad. On the contrary: it is hard because it is so good. You need some patience to understand you are in a whole new world, with its own fauna and flora. We have skyeels! Kelek's breath, skyeels! The peoples are different. The animals are different. EVERYTHING is different. Even the weather. I've found some references to anime and manga, especially One Piece here. The climate is pretty much crazy, just like the Grand Line's climate is also crazy. Seasons come and go unexpectedly, and they last what? Months? Weeks? No one really knows. And then, there are the Highstorms. They come from the Almighty-knows-where, and they come because... Why do they come, after all? Who sends them, and why? Why do they always come from there? The direction we call stormward? Highstorms are so powerful, and so important, that they have shaped the world and its creatures and plants. But what are they? When did they start blowing? They must be linked to the Heralds... The Knights Radiant, maybe? The Voidbringers? So many questions, and so little time to answer them... Because the True Desolation approaches, and Odium reigns. Really, I can't detail the book too much, because it would take days. I've already made a chaos of my review, but that's because the book is SO good. The series is planned to have 10 books. I don't know if Mr. Sanderson is ever going to read this, but anyway: if those book are NEARLY as good as the first one, then you, sir, will have written the most beautiful and epic fantasy of all time. I don't think it is possible for something to be better than the first book, but I wouldn't be surprised if Brandon did it. He is a master, and that's for sure. I'm so glad I got to read his work. SO GLAD... Kelek provide you live long and prosper, Brandon. Thank you.","2013-03-17","United States","","true","5","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAH35D60U430X"
"B003P2WO5E","5","did I love this book","Wow, did I love this book. I began with the audiobook, and then picked up a hardcover in order to add it to my library. I have to say, it did start a bit slow and took awhile to pick up, so it wasn't until a quarter of the way through that I really got into it. That is probably my largest fault of the book. It is so huge that not everyone is going to stick around past that first quarter waiting for it to get good. I am definitely glad I did stick it out though. The setting took some getting used to. Sanderson imagines a world quite different from your standard Medieval Europe that 90% of the genre closing aligns with. After I got over the fact that I would need to put more effort into understanding the world and its inhabitants, I actually grew to like it. It gave me more to look forward to pulling out of the reading. It doesn't take much for me to imagine a Medieval boar hunt, or even something like a dragon hunt, for that matter; but it is a whole different story when I am thrust into the middle of a Chasmfiend hunt in the middle of the Shattered Plains. Fortunately Sanderson's writing does very well to put the reader into the moment, learning something about the world, the characters involved, and using it to advance the plot all at the same time. The book opens up with a prologue, taking place thousands of years in the past, and then more just several years in the past. The rest is broken up into a series of Parts. Each part contains several chapters from two to three of the main POV characters. There is then an interlude between each part which contains POV chapters from a couple minor characters, which show things about the world and plot beyond what just the main characters are involved in. Being this falls very appropriately into the Epic Fantasy genre, getting to see the rest of the world and important plot matters separate from the main characters was very nice. My only complaint was that I was so engrossed into the main characters' stories, that I got annoyed that I would have to read through several chapters of interlude before returning to their story. Though there are a couple other characters that get a handful of POV chapters outside of the interludes, the three primary POV characters are Dalinar Kholin, Kaladin, and Shallan Devar. Dalinar may be my favorite character. I don't want to give too much away, but he is a middle-aged noble lord and warrior who is honorable to a fault. Often this kind of character would come across as too perfect, or faultless, but the plot doesn't let that be the case. Great honor can be a character flaw when it isn't conducive to the environment, and Dalinar is constantly butting heads with the social system and his peers, and his convictions are always put to the test. Kaladin is a younger commoner-type soldier. He has a natural affinity for leadership and is a great fighter. He is pretty headstrong though, and very set in his prejudices. He is again the type of character, like Dalinar, that you have seen time and time again. For some reason though, Sanderson makes him just barely unique enough that I wasn't bored by him as a character. The plot, of course, just takes him to a whole other level, and if I hadn't been paying attention to the character in a vacuum, I would have never noticed that he was borderline Mary Sue. Where Dalinar's greatest obstacles are largely the others around him, Kaladin is often struggling internally as well as externally. I must say, as much as I like the character, there were a couple points where Sanderson almost let Kaladin's internal turmoil go too far for me, the reader. Just as I was starting to think to myself, ""ok, could we not wallow in self-pity for yet another chapter?"" the plot finally moved on and I didn't have to set the book down. Shallan is a young noble woman from a minor foreign house who is seeking out Dalinar's niece for a wardship. She is very bright, has a sharp tongue when she doesn't watch herself, and extremely talented at drawing. I enjoyed reading her story as much as the other two. Part of the joy in her story is watching her grow. As a character, she is the youngest and the most naive to the rest of the world, and has the most to learn about the world and herself. As I mentioned above, I consumed most of this book in the audiobook version. While I enjoyed having a female narrator for the chapters told from a POV character, I was some what thrown out of the moment a couple times toward the end. A secondary character, who was always a part of one of the male character's chapters, and thus voiced by the male narrator, suddenly got her own chapter, voiced by the female narrator. It was very odd to suddenly hear another voice for some of the characters I had grown accustomed to under the other narrator. Even more jarring, was when she pronounced a couple of names dramatically different. Overall, fantastic book. I am glad I finally broke down and tried it out, after seeing it on a list of ""Top Fantasy Series."" I have already read book two, and am very much looking forward to the rest of the series.","2015-09-09","United States","","true","6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MPZ2HCH62ONN"
"B003P2WO5E","5","Masterful","Sanderson is a genius. An author myself, and a VERY picky reader, I rarely find books that I honestly think are worthy of great praise. This easily fits in the ""top notch"" category. The world-building is impeccable. Characters are believable and relatable. A thoroughly developed magic system (this book only scratches the surface of it) hints at more to come. Engaging dialog, well developed plot twists, strong philosophical overtones, clever wit (pun intended), and visual descriptions make this a hit on all levels. Even the wordiness of it isn't cumbersome.","2025-06-18","United States","","true","7","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10CP8ZQ5MXSS8"
"B003P2WO5E","5","Another Great Fantasy Epic","There will be some MINOR SPOILERS here. This is going to be one of my longest reviews yet. The Way of Kings is the first book in Brandon Sandersons supposed challenger to the Wheel of Time series. Brandon Sanderson himself is the man who finished the Wheel of Time series with the last two books at the behest of the Estate of Robert Jordan, so he has the chops to write. Further, Sanderson has written quite a few books that I personally have enjoyed, including the Mistborn Saga and Steelheart, and the Rithmatist. It’s safe to say, I enjoy this man’s writing. In the Way of Kings, the world is constantly ravaged by “highstorms” which basically appear to be Hurricanes. The world has adapted to it, and there is some sort of magical quality to these storms as the currency, these gemstones, absorb “Stormlight”. The gems act as both a lightsource frequently, and the currency as well. The book follows three primary storylines using point of view styled storytelling, along with interludes using tertiary characters. The primary characters are Kaladin (an ex soldier turned slave turned bridgeman), Shallan (the sheltered daughter of a dead nobleman trying to save her house), and Dalinar (a Highprince and uncle to the king). Each character has their own goals and wants, and the storylines are all interesting in their own rights. The book is LONG, at just over 1000 pages. But I found myself reading it nonstop as its very character focused. Each character was interesting and while seperate, eventually their stories start to intersect. The story starts with an assassin, called The Man in White, killing the King of the Aleshi, on the night of their treaty signing with this group called the Parshendi. The Parshendi take credit for the killing, and a war breaks out. It has been 6 years since the war had started when our story begins. Kaladin’s story focuses on his trials as a slave turned bridgeman, a person who has to run large wooden bridges for a highprinces army. The bridgemen as expected to die as they are basically bait for the Parshendi archers. Kaladin is basically a broken man but eventually starts to overcome his own issues and tries his best to rally his fellow Bridgemen and keep them alive. Shallan however, is the daughter of a noble who has died, and his family has decided to hide his death in an attempt to avoid creditors. She goes chasing after the kings sister, Jasnah, to steal an item called a Soulcaster. She eventually learns several amazing things about herself and discovers a love of learning, as Jasnah is primarily a scholar. A lot of her story is focused on learning about the world and the history of the world. And finally, Dalinar is the uncle to the King and a Highprince, basically a leader of a country. He is a very honorable man who dislikes the games his fellow highprinces play with the war, and follows a very strict “Code” and forces his children to follow it as well. He bodyguards his nephew against assassins as well. Dalinar is plagued by visions throughout the book and a great deal of his story is him trying to figure out if he is going mad or not, along with dealing with the politics of war. By the end of the story all three plot lines begin to tie together, and the ending was satisfying while also making me want to read the next book to see how things turn out. Some things that are truly fascinating to me is the usage of racism as a way of life. The characters in Aleshi, the main country, are divided by the Lighteyes, and the Darkeyes. Your eye color determines your station and if you are a noble or not. A Darkeyes cannot be a noble and generally must obey the orders of the Lighteyes. Kaladin is a Darkeyes, as an example, while Dalinar and Shallan are lighteyes. Further, woman are the scholars in Aleshi, while men deal with war and the like. In fact, Men do not learn to read or write, having their wives handle such things. Its quite interesting as beyond there, the gender’s are basically equal. The Parshendi are, at least for now, an Enigma. Not much is known about them from the character’s point of view beyond the fact that they sing nearly constantly, and they hold their dead with the highest reverence. Whats really interesting is that there is a race of people who are totally subservient to the Aleshi called Parshman, which appear to be cousins of the Parshendi. The last thing I want to touch on is the magic system. As with all Sanderson novels, there is a magic system here, but there seem to be only a few practitioners. First there is Soulcasting, which is something Jasnah and others like her can do. It basically lets them transmute any one thing into anything else. Like turning stone into bread for example. This is something that people do with the aid of Soulcasters. There is also Surgebinding, of which the only one the reader knows about at the start is the Assassin in White. Surgebinding lets him defy gravity, push or pull objects, and stick objects together. Surgebinding requires Stormlight to use, and a Surgebinder absorbs the Stormlight that is stored in the various gems. Finally, there are the Shardblades and the Shardplate. These are more magical artifacts, left over from a time when a group of beings called Radiants walked the world. These weapons are bound to a person. Shardplate is basically power armor in fantasy form, increasing its wearers strength, speed, and defense. Shadeblades are almost like plasma swords. They can cut nonliving material likes it nothing, and living matter they “kill” without actually damaging it. Get hit by a Shardblade in the arm, the arm itself dies and can never be used. Shardblades also must be summoned, and if the carrier is disarmed of one it vanishes into mist. The Way of Kings is an interesting book and looks like a great intro to a new series. My only real issue is with its length, as some people may put off from its sheer size. But if you enjoyed Sandersons previous works or want a fantasy novel that is not the same old same old, give Way of Kings a try.","2015-09-16","United States","","true","8","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PT4V90C07X6M"
"B003P2WO5E","5","Well...I'm back.","I felt when putting a title on this review that the final words of ""The Lord of the Rings"" would be somewhat appropriate. I, like Samwise the Brave, have returned from a great journey. That journey lies within the pages of Brandon Sanderson's novel, ""The Way of Kings"". There are a couple bottom lines I'd like to make clear before I discuss this book in more depth, and I'll go ahead and set them up here to prevent anyone from unnecessarily spending their valuable time. 1. ""The Way of Kings"" is the best book I've read in a while. 9.5/10 on my scale. 2. I've noticed a lot of reviews draw comparisons between ""Kings"" and Robert Jordan's ""The Eye of the World"" / ""The Wheel of Time"" series. This got me thinking - it's probably good that I make clear what I think of the three prevalent fantasy-series touchstones before I discuss this book so whoever reads this knows how my mind works. This reader loved ""A Game of Thrones"" as well as the subsequent series, but found books 4 and 5 quite tedious. My reactions to Robert Jordan's WoT series are lukewarm at best - I found ""The Eye of the World"" to be derivative, predictable, and a lot of the time very poorly written. This being said, yes, I enjoyed it for what it was. I loved ""The Lord of the Rings,"" but have clearer and fonder memories of ""The Hobbit"". 3. Books like ""Dune"" tax my patience. Heavily. 4. I hate reviews with spoilers. Be at peace, wary reader. Here, there be no dragons. 5. This book is over 1200 pages long. I've spent about three weeks reading it. This review is going to be long as well, and arguably nowhere near as well written. 6. Did I mention that I didn't like ""Dune""? Now that we've gotten the introductions out of the way, on to ""The Way of Kings"" itself. I'll go ahead and call it TWOK from here on out. It sounds cool and it's easier to type. So. Here we go. ATMOSPHERE: As I think I already made clear, this book absolutely blew me away. Carried me away might be a better phrase, actually, or transported me Elsewhere with a capital E. It did everything I want a fantasy book to do - took me out of my world and introduced me to one so fantastic, so alien, so unforgettable and yet so believable that I found myself thinking about it...well, all the time. I would describe the world in detail, but so many other reviews have beaten me to it I'll skip that and relegate myself to saying this - imagine an ocean floor without the ocean. I think someone may have actually already written that. Well done, anonymous person. You hit it right on the head. There are more mysteries in this world than there are answers, and whenever one question is answered another four sprout up in its place. The nature of the highstorms (and their somewhat ominous sounding ""Origin"") was of particular note to me, not to mention the nature of ""spren,"" the strange spirits that accompany basically everything in the world. If I were to pick a character to fall in with, I'd roger up with Axies the Collector, a side character from one of the Interludes who I sincerely wish Sanderson would make into an entire storyline. When you find yourself fascinated by the daily life of characters that have no bearing whatsoever on the overall storyline, you know the author has done something right with their Worldbuilding. This, actually, brings me right into my next point of review. CHARACTERS: The book focuses on four main characters, or maybe it would be more accurate to say three and a half. Kaladin, Dalinar and Shallan account for the majority of the book, and though he appears far less frequently, Szeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar (Yes, that's his name) accounts for what remains. There are a smattering of side characters, some utterly forgettable and others utterly unforgettable (Axies the Collector, for instance, who travels the world studying spren) and they form the interludes between parts. In the end, you'll care about some more than others. Fortunately, Sanderson did this on purpose. The result is that when one chapter ends, you're angry because you don't want to leave their storyline. And then you finish the next chapter, and feel the same way. And so on and so forth. It's similar to what Martin did with his Song of Ice and Fire series, except without the Sansa chapters. I noticed that one of the chief complaints about this book was that it has a lack of gray characters. This fascinates me, because gray characters tend to grate on me after a while. Again, I'll go ahead and reference that Other (pun intended) epic fantasy series, ""A Song of Ice and Fire,"" for a reference point here. I love it when characters surprise me. I don't like it when there aren't really any heroes I feel like I can root for. George Martin, I'm talking to you here. But I digress. Are the characters in TWOK relatively one dimensional? I suppose maybe they are. There are others who suggest the characters found in this book are largely derivative. I disagree, except to say that they are very typical heroes. I think I like that, though. I like that Sanderson has heroes who are capable of heroic things. Who else would a fantasy writer choose to follow? The uneventful people? Would that be like Holden Caulfield goes to Middle Earth? I don't know. Maybe it could work. The point is that Sanderson has characters I can get behind, characters I can fall in love with, who I can fear for (I'm thinking of one character in particular here) and who when they are in genuine danger I can start gnawing my fingernails. I thought the characters in this were great, for what they were. And let's be honest here. The last 75 pages have more twists and character revelations packed into them than the other 1125 pages combined. This brings me around to the next part of my thoughts. PLOT, PROSE AND PROGRESS: One of the chief complaints about ""The Way of Kings"" is that nothing much happens in it. I blame this sentiment (and yes, I use the word blame because I think this is a shortcoming of us as readers) on the fact that we live in a largely instant society. We want everything NOW. Take, for instance, the adoration a lot of people have for ""The Eye of the World"". Things start happening pretty fast in that book and they don't really let up. For a reader like me, that's boring. TWOK is more about setting up a storyline. It's a 1200 page introduction to a 10 book mega-epic that demands an enormous setup. It's the kind of book that has a prelude and a prologue, lots of interludes and lots of parts. This being said, I never once felt like the book was lacking in action. There are battles galore, intrigues, mysteries, romances and failures. There's a real sense of wonder and mystery in this world - its inhabitants are as baffled by it as we are as readers. This comforts me. I liked that I didn't feel stupid reading this book. A lot of the time, I was sitting there going ""Wait, what's this now?"" only to discover a character a few pages later going ""So wait...what was that, then?"" Sanderson is trying something interesting here, introducing a world where characters don't know what's happening. Unlike most other books, which have the standard Wise Old Person to tell them exactly what is happening, this book doesn't have one (yet). The characters, readers and story wander around in the dark with a candle, looking for something while hearing frightening sounds coming from the shadows. The Alethi Kingdom is at war, and yet everyone has a strange sense of creeping dread that we the readers are infected by. We know SOMETHING is coming - we just don't know what. Something called the Night of Sorrows. The True Desolation. What that means and who its bringing, we never do quite figure, but it sure doesn't sound like they're bringing sweeties. Brandon Sanderson has a strange way of writing. I say this fondly. His prose is never astonishing. When I read George Martin, for example, I usually come across a paragraph/line or two that I savor in my mouth for a bit before carrying on. Patrick Rothfuss does this too, and so does R. Scott Bakker. There are always those zingers that I text to my friends, often annoying them with my enthusiasm. Sanderson has none of that. His paragraphs are simple, his words elemental. He sets out to tell us a story, not wow us with his language. I'm wowed anyway. Prose this transparent, this clear, this unpolluted and convincing...it's a gift. In other words, his writing is deceptively intelligent. I was in awe for reasons I've never really been in awe before. In fact, when someone asked me for a good quote from the book, I was genuinely stumped. The book itself is a quote. It cannot be separated from itself. OTHER FACTORS: One of the things that impressed me most about this book was the storyline of Kaladin. Kaladin himself may be your run of the mill hero (the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emp - oh, wait, wrong movie, I mean book, I mean - aw phooey...) but he's approached differently than I've ever seen a character like this approached in fantasy. Here, Kaladin earns his place as a leader by a painstaking process which unfolds over literally hundreds of pages. Leadership isn't a microwave meal, and neither is Kaladin's story. His struggles, his dilemmas, his obstacles and solutions are all strikingly realistic. As a current United States Marine, I found myself thinking a lot about some of the people I serve with while I read this. The portrayal of what it means to be a leader that Sanderson has created here is uncannily accurate, and really gives some good guidance on what it means to be a better leader. This, needless to say, is quite impressive. I noticed some complaints that the women have hardly any role in this book. This is true. Only one of the three main characters is female, and she only has one of the biggest character twists in the story. (If you haven't caught the sarcasm dripping from my words, here's your cue to chuckle.) Look, I'm not going to deny that the women in this book are pretty much the same spunky independent females you get in most fantasy books, but I think that can boil down the fact that it's surprisingly difficult to write a female character everyone can get behind. The closest thing I can think of off the back of my hand is probably Katniss from the recent ""Hunger Games"" trilogy, and even she had her nay-sayers. Plus, she was written by a woman, which definitely helps. This is a story about war, and the women in it are certainly subject to a patriarchal society. I for one have a hunch they will play a bigger role later on in the series (in fact, the twist I mentioned in Shallan's storyline basically assures this). Magic is used in a way unlike anything I've really seen before. Rather than dying out in the world of Roshar, it's coming back, and no one really knows what it is or how to handle it. The result is exhilarating - magic feels mysterious, dangerous and intriguing. Exactly the way magic should feel, in my opinion - unless its in ""Harry Potter"". For example, in TWOK, gems hold stormlight in them which is used to power magical armor called Shardplate or to light a street. Different colored gems means multicolored lanterns. As a result, streets at night turn into little disco parlors. This is just one of the many ways Sanderson uses magic in this world. Most importantly, I think, is the sense of wholeness that Sanderson's world has here. The amount of detail with which he can see the imaginary is nothing less than astonishing. The book comes with a copious amount of artwork inside it, which adds to the story in a way I've never seen used before. The art is beautiful and masterfully done, to the point that I want to buy the hardcover edition of this book just so I can have larger copies of it. WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Not much. I mean that honestly. I noticed one of the chief complaints amongst readers was that the book was too long. This made me chuckle a little bit. It reminded me of when I went to see ""The Return of the King"" in theaters, knowing full well that the film was going to run over three hours, and yet my friends still complained about how long it was. Friends and fellow readers. Please, for the love of everything that is holy, don't pick up a book that is 1200+ pages and then complain that it is long. Yes, it is very long. It was intended to be. It's a comprehensive, detailed look at a magical world. Not every moment is going to be spent in swashbuckling glory. There are going to be times when characters need to sit around campfires discussing the strange natures of markings on other character's chests. This book didn't come out of a microwave. Someone sat down and wrote out 1200 pages of great material that culminated in a great book with a distinct beginning, middle and end. I dare you to try the same. Are there some parts of the story where the language gets carried away with itself? Sure. As long as I'm being honest, I actually had to put down the book a couple times to rub my eyes when a couple of the characters had incredibly emo moments. I also had to put a belt between my teeth early on to avoid breaking all my molars at the shockingly immature use of the word ""storm"" as a swear word. It's funny - the story addresses mature themes such as suicide, murder, rape, the controversy of religion - and yet when it comes to swearing, characters say things like ""Storm you!"" or even ""Storm off!"" I think my favorite was ""Storm off!"". I wondered the first time I read that if I had made a terrible mistake. Are there slow parts? You bet. There were a few slow parts in a couple other books that come to mind, such as ""War and Peace,"" ""Anna Karenina,"" ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" even ""East of Eden"". ""But Sanderson is neither Russian nor a Depression era Californian!"" some people cry. Sure. He's not. He's a 21st Century American writer who wanted to tell a story about a war and a whole lot more than that. A few slow parts in a 1200 page book really isn't that bad. If you are looking for instant gratification, STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK. If you're looking for a world to roll around in and delight in, please, buy it and encourage this man to write more. I honestly don't know what I'm going to be doing for the next year. Last but not least, the real subject matter of the book - namely a couple of the twists towards book's end - made me hesitate. Understand now that this book has a very serious undertone to it, and when it hits you what this series is really about, you'll know. I can think of another fantasy trilogy which addresses themes Sanderson brings up late in this book, but I'm willing to operate on a little faith here. (For those who have read the book, you'll get the pun there.) The twists are great. A couple of them I genuinely didn't see coming, and they blew me clean off my rocker. One was underwhelming. One was genuinely bewildering. So it goes. In the end, I can't recommend this book enough. It's got great - albeit one dimensional - characters, an utterly original storyline with just enough of the familiar fantasy trope to make us feel at home in our own genre. The world it introduces to us is breathtaking, one which we will have no problem whatsoever spending 10 books frolicking in. The questions it raises at books end are tantalizing, not to mention dangerous. It is very well written, and the best thing I've read since I first met the Others north of the Wall over two years ago, shivering in the snow. Bravo, Mr. Sanderson. Bravo. 9.5/10 **EDIT: Upon re-reading ""The Way of Kings"" in preparation for ""Words of Radiance,"" I feel confident in its original score. I will keep a tally of the overall series here as it comes out, as well.** Book 1: The Way of Kings - 9.5/10 Book 2: Words of Radiance - 8.8/10, Excellent but unfulfilled due to pacing issues.

"B003P2WO5E","5","Stormfather!","STORMFATHER! This book was amazing. All the stars. This review may be spoilerish?! It has been a few years since I have read a high fantasy/epic fantasy such as this one. I just recently finished The Name of the Wind and that one is high fantasy, but it does not compare to The Way of Kings. I love books that are about war, swords and fighting just do something for me. I love books that go into detail of war, and strategy and the ins and out of how a war is fought. I sometimes even like the politics, in some books it's over done and some it's done just right. For me, it was done just right in this one. When I felt like it might be too much, the scene changed. The world building was amazing, the descriptions and the fashions of the different lands was awesome. I like to falling into a book that can take me away from every day life. I need a book to do that for me. I mean I even need a book to change my damn vocabulary. Now when I'm mad, I say ""Storm it"", or surprised ""Stormfather!"", or mad ""Damnation!"" Yeah, I think my family and co-workers think I am psycho. I need to want more, to fall in love with strong characters and want to give up my life so I can train in the art of sword fighting. I want two horses, one white and one black, just so I can name them Gallant & Sureblood. I want a ginourmous sword that I can name Oathbringer. If you haven't guessed yet, I love this book. I love it so much, I devoted a whole month to it and only was able to squeeze in three other books. THREE!! I normally read 15-20 books a month! And guess what, I am starting book two in three days! So I need to catch up on other reads before that starts. 119 Status Updates! 119! I think that's the most I have ever left for a book. My kindle app has already crashed from trying to upload all the highlights, notes, and marks I left. I think I might have highlighted half of the book...or more.. ""The love of men is a frigid thing, a mountain stream only three steps from the ice. We are his. Oh Stormfather...we are his. It is but a thousand days, and the Everstorm comes."" Dalinar Kholin, oh Dalinar you sexy man you. Of all the characters he is my favorite. Dalinar Kholin is an Alethi Highprince, he is fighting a war to avenge the death of his brother, the King, Gavilar. He is called the Blackthorn, and is a Shardbearer. To become a Shardbearer one has to win it in battle. You have to kill another Shardbearer and take their Shardplate and Shardblade. His only downfall, he has visions, hallucinations that can bring down him and his house. Dalinar believe in a united Alethkar and fights to bring it together and impose the code on his soldiers. Alethi Codes of War Readiness-The Officer will be prepared at all times for battle. Never drunken on wine never without his weapon. Inspiration-The Officer will wear his uniform when in public to look ready for war and to give strength to his troops. Restraint-The Officer will refrain from needless duels, arguments, or squabbles with other officers in camp, to prevent injury to men who may be needed to command. Leadership-The Officer will require no action of his soldiers that he would not be willing to perform himself. Honor-The Officer will not abandon allies on the field, nor will he seek to profit from the loss of his allies. Before Gavilar dies he tells leaves a message for Dalinar. You must find the most important words a man can say THE THRILL! Dalinar took a deep breath, feeling the Thrill build for the approaching battle. He strode from the war room, footfalls firm and solid. Attendants and servants scattered before him, making way. Wearing Shardplate again after a long period without was like waking up after a night of feeling groggy or disoriented. The spring of the step, the impetus the armor seemed to lend him, made him want to race down the hallway. He broke into a sprint. Teleb and the others cried out in surprise, rushing to keep up. Dalinar outpaced them easily, reaching the front gates of the complex and leaping through, throwing himself off the long steps leading down from his enclave. He exulted, grinning as he hung in the air, then slammed to the ground. The force cracked the stone beneath him, and he crouched into the impact. ^^Favorite scene. Kaladin is the most honorable of heroes I have read. I thought Kvothe was amazing, but Kaladin takes the cake. He is a surgeons son, and now a slave. He fought in Amarams and was eventually betrayed. He's lost his brother, his family and many many people around him. He's an accomplished spearman, and a natural leader. He is sold to Sadeas as a bridgeman and is now apart of bridge four. From the beginning he is determined to keep his team alive, and he does everything he can to win his team over. Gadol spit up blood, coughing. ""They break the land itself!"" he hissed, eyes wild. ""They want it, but in their rage they will destroy it. Like jealous man burns his rich things rather than let them be taken by his enemies! They come!"" He gasped. And then he fell still, his dead eyes staring upward, bloody spittle running in a trail down his cheek. His final, haunting words hung over them. Also I can not mention Syl, she's so funny and cute. I hope for a love match or something between her and Kaladin. ""Soon you'll hardly be a spren at all. You'll be a little translucent philosopher. We'll have to send you off to a monastery to spend your time in deep, important thoughts."" ""Yes,"" she said, ""like how to best get the ardents there to accidentally drink a mixture that will turn his mouth blue."" She smiled mischievously. Then there is Shallan. She is from Jah Keved and she is in Kharbranth seeking out the heretic Jasnah Kholin. She wishes to be become her ward and steal her precious soulcaster. I don't want to go into anymore without giving away what happens, but there are a lot of things we learn about Shallan and still a lot of things we do not know. ""Father,"" Adolin said, feeling pained, ""if there's something wrong here, it's that we're not trying hard enough. You think the highprinces are playing games? Well, show them the way it should be done! Instead of talking of retreat, we should be talking of advancing, striking at the Parshendi instead of besieging them."" Adolin Kholin, I was expecting to dislike him through out the entire book, but that changed the more I got to know him. Adolin love to court women, love to duel and has fierce loyalty to his father and family. He's very much Dalinar's son but unsure of things and unsure of himself. I guess any 23 year old would be. But he does worry about his father and his visions and if his father is really loosing his mind. I think the redeeming part for me is when he is actually fighting by his fathers side and confesses to believe all that his father has told him. The last 20% just threw all over the place. I was sad, happy, angry, in shock, dumbfounded. I wanted to throw the phone/kindle/book across the room. I screamed! I yelled! And then I was determined to read the next damn book to find out what the hell is going on! There are no words to describe the last 20% and I see this review is probably the longest I have written. But know this, I will probably have 200 update statuses for the next book and have an even bigger book hangover having to wait MONTHS for the next. I can say that I am a new Brandon Sanderson addict. I need more..I want more...I will die if I don't get more! So if you love high fantasy, want to loose a month out of your life...please read this. Better yet, get the audio. So you can loose time while you washing clothes, walking to the car, driving to work, cleaning you house, working out at the gym, and while waiting for the doctor. Do it! P.S. There are way to many quotes and descriptions to put here but I will leave you with some of my favorites. MEN RIDE THE STORMS NO LONGER. The voice thunder, crashing in the air. THE OATHPACT IS BROKEN, CHILD OF HONOR. ""I don't understand!"" Kaladin screamed into the tempest. A face formed before him, its eyes full of stars. ODIUM COMES. MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL THE SIXTEEN. YOU WILL NOW GO. ODIUM REIGNS He roared, striking down four Parshendi as two more hit him from behind, making his armor vibrate. He spun and killed one, the other barely dancing out of range. Dalinar began to pant, and when he moved quickly, he left trails of blue Stormlight in the air. He felt like a bloodied prey beast trying to fend off a thousand different snapping predators at once. Never fight other men except when forced to in war. Bang! Let your actions defend you, not your words. Bang! Expect honor from those you meet, and give them the chance to live up to it. Bang! Rule as you would be ruled. Bang!","2014-04-04","United States","","true","10","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YUDGGAAM18YE"
"B003P2WO5E","5","An awesome, epic introduction to a great fantasy series","As one of the most popular fantasy series of the last few years, it should be no surprise that the first book in this series sucked me in from the very beginning. It's epic in scope, well-developed, and hard to put down with all of the action and political machinations and, of course, magic. Huge recommendation for fans of high fantasy. It's nearly impossible to summarize a 1200+ page book in a few sentences, as there are so many characters and sub-plots that run through the story, but the main characters stay consistent in their frequency of appearance in the chapters. Kaladin is a young former soldier of prodigious talent with a spear, who we discover through the book was betrayed by his commander and sold into slavery as a ""bridgeman,"" a worker whose sole purpose is to carry portable bridges to span the chasms on the plains where his nation is fighting a war against a strange race of human-like beings; Kaladin is a natural leader with a painful past, but an ability to encourage men to unite and better themselves. Dalinar is a middle-aged highprince, part of the light-eyed nobility of his nation, brother to a king who had been murdered by an assassin a handful of years ago, sparking the current war, and uncle and principle advisor/general to the current king; Dalinar is plagued with strange visions of the past featuring the Knights Radiant, a near-mythological group of ancient knights with magical weapons, armor, and abilities, some of which have drifted down through history to be held by regular individuals in the current age. Adolin, Dalinar's son, is an excellent solider and duelist, and at times a spoiled prince, who tends to rebel against his father's need to stick to outdated Codes outlining the honorable conduct of a soldier. Shallan is a teenaged girl blossoming into womanhood, left with the weight of saving her declining house from total bankruptcy after her father had lost all fortune and the respect of his peers; Shallan has a brilliant mind, a quick wit, and a true talent for artistry that seems almost supernatural, and seeks to gain the trust of Jasnah, niece of Dalinar and sister of the king, who is a respected and erudite scholar, and just maybe a bit of a heretic against her own culture's religion. The cast of characters is voluminous, but most chapters revolve around these main ones, as they seek to understand the world and their roles in it, and possibly avert a world-changing disaster they've just become aware is brewing. The plot is epic in all meanings of the word: big, lengthy, involved, full of emotions and motivations and purpose, stretching to all points of the world that Sanderson has created out of whole cloth. It's clear that the author has spent a great deal of effort planning the millenia of backstory that predates the setting of the novel, and that plan is detailed and rich. There are multiple independent systems (or sources) of magic, each with its own rules and users, some seeming to be created from nature, others seeming to be fabrications of men and women. The history of the novel's world is deep, and trickles out in small bits throughout the long story, such that once the reader feels the dominant religion/mythology is finally understood, a new bit of ancient history is revealed that shows just how that religion has changed over time and may not be fully grasped by either the reader or the religion's current adherents. The characters are very well-developed, each with his or her own motivations and reasons for being where he or she is in life. All told, the plot is thick and convoluted, but in such a good way that the reader feels each character is growing and developing, while the action and plot still move along at a quick pace. This is one of those books that is incredibly hard to put down, so you may find yourself up all night reading. I really did struggle to find something to criticize in this book, but I did find a few things. While I know the author has his main characters trying to build a better world while battling their society's own shortcomings, there is still a startling undercurrent of racism to the culture being described: the main opponents of the war on the Shattered Plains are a mostly dark-skinned race seen as primitive, whose more docile cousins are used by the other nations as slave labor and described as all looking alike, which is viewed as normal and almost necessary for the culture of the mostly light-skinned and -eyed, and supposedly more noble, race on the other side of the war. At one point, the author made the surprising use of the word ""moolie,"" which shocked me -- its use was as a pejorative nickname for a mute, and not a racial slur, but still it's a choice that the author made that perhaps wasn't well thought out and struck me as unnecessarily offensive when he could have used literally any other existing or made-up word. There was also the problem that I find all too pervasive in many fantasy books, a genre I love: there is a stark overuse of names using the letters A, K, L, and N (e.g., Kaladin, Dalinar, Adolin, Adalar, Elhokar, Navani, Jasnah, Shallan, etc.) -- after a while, all the names seem to have come from a standard Boggle tileset with only a few letters or syllables to choose from. I know that this may be passed on as distinctive for the racial/linguistic setting of the novel, but its similarities to many other names in many other fantasy series leaves me with the taste that such overuse of certain syllables is derivative, rather than original. Also, a surprising number of these names, when combined with the character's family name, follow a strange rule that Aleister Crowley (the occultist) set out that the best-sounding names are a dactyl (three syllables with emphasis on the first syllable) followed by a spondee (two syllables of equal emphasis), as if they were all created specifically for fitting in a certain poetic meter -- I'm not sure if I'm impressed by this, or if I view this as another example of derivative names. As for the writing mechanics, the book is incredibly clean. Sure, there are a few split infinitives and a handful of examples of ""most everyone"" or ""most all,"" but in a book more than 1200 pages long, the number of grammatical or syntactical errors is actually miniscule compared to a lot of books out there these days. I enjoy Sanderson's writing style, which hints at both ""high"" fantasy writing and colloquial conversational banter. It's nice to read such a long book without wanting to throw it against the wall every few pages because of an egregious writing error. Overall, I'm excited to be into this series at long last. I understand it's intended to be a 10-book series, and so far there are only 3 released (with a fourth maybe coming later this year?), so I fully expect to be enjoying this rich world Sanderson has built for another few years. A huge recommendation for anyone who even kind of likes high fantasy series.","2020-05-25","United States","","true","11","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DM5JJLRIU985"
"B003P2WO5E","4","The four stars specifically reflects a one-star deduction as to the Kindle edition.","""The Way of Kings"" is the first book I've read on a Kindle, as the device was a Christmas 2010 present from my parents. I have to say that the Kindle is a lot more comfortable than holding a 1000-page book, especially when you travel. I'll first comment on the book generally as a work and then make a couple of Kindle-specific comments at the end. I don't intend for this to be a review of the Kindle, but I do think it's fair to comment on aspects of THIS book as I read it on that device so that others considering the e-book purchase will have the benefit (if any) of those thoughts. I also want to avoid spoilers. As one of the lead reviews said, I read it spoiler-free and I found that to be very valuable. I was quite impressed with the book. I've read ""Elantris,"" the Mistborn trilogy, and ""Warbreaker,"" as well as the two Wheel of Time volumes, and as far as Sanderson's own work goes I think this one is the most mature work so far. I've always loved a good LONG book that will absorb you to the point where you can get deep into the story before the book is over. It frustrates me insanely when a book feels like it's over before it gets started. ""The Way of Kings"" definitely doesn't do that. But it's also not written to a depth that makes it impossible to follow what's going on or to track the multiple storylines. As much as I love the Wheel of Time, it can get frustrating trying to remember which character is doing what at any given point (a problem surely exacerbated by the slow publishing schedule, though I recognize the extenuating circumstances there in recent years). As other reviews have noted, this book focuses on three main characters and sticks with each one for several chapters at a time, allowing you to immerse yourself in that character's activity before the focus moves. I like that because it allows me to absorb myself more than the style where each chapter jumps you to a different place. That latter style can be effective in giving you a frenzied feeling if a lot is going on, or if storylines are converging, but ""The Way of Kings"" is the first volume of what is to be a massive series. The other thing Sanderson has done is that he's introduced some characters who will clearly play big roles in the future, but he's held off on focusing too much on them, perhaps so as not to fragment the story too much too quickly. I appreciate that. If you read this book, you MUST, and I underscore MUST, remember that you are reading the first volume of a very long series, so you cannot allow yourself to get too focused on a plot point that isn't explained or a character who only appears sporadically. I also rather like the lack of explanation of a lot of things in the story. Sometimes I find it frustrating when a fantasy author introduces new concepts without explaining them. This is the first time Sanderson has done that; in the Mistborn trilogy, for example, I thought Kelsier explained Allomancy fairly well. In ""The Way of Kings,"" we learn about the highstorms and the spren and some of the world's history, but we don't learn a LOT about them. We don't even necessarily learn a lot about some of the major characters, other than the backstory relating to Kaladin (told via a series of flashbacks). Robert Jordan would have used his famous line ""RAFO"" (""Read and find out"") in reference to a lot of these things, and now that I've finished the book I think that a lot of the questions the book leaves open seem to me to have been written that way as plot points for future volumes. Sanderson loves to throw in some major plot twists that will surprise the reader, and this book is no exception. But here, those plot twists serve as major points that will--if you enjoy this book--whet your appetite for future volumes. I'll also mention that some other reviewers have noted that some of the magic in this book, particularly at the start, shows some similarities to the Allomantic material in the Mistborn trilogy. When I started reading the book I was initially a bit wary because I wondered if we'd be seeing something of the same sort (perhaps along the lines of how some readers criticized David Eddings's Elenium and Tamuli series for largely telling the same story that the Belgariad and Malloreon told). After reading the whole book, it's apparent that the particular type of magic in question is something that is to be developed in future volumes. So if you start reading this and your alarm bell goes ""Mistborn Redux, I already read this,"" hit the snooze button on that alarm! All in all, a very well-done work in my opinion. I thought that some of Terry Brooks's early Shannara books (the original trilogy and the Heritage of Shannara quartet) had a depth to the story that has been lacking in most of Mr. Brooks's more recent works, and (aside from the Wheel of Time) I've been waiting for another author to come up with a deeper story along those lines, as opposed to the shorter trilogies that have become common. Terry Goodkind came close with the Sword of Truth series, and while I enjoyed that series a great deal, some of the lengthy speeches and a few repetitive plot points (Richard feeling betrayed by Kahlan) took away from an otherwise good work. Where I think ""The Way of Kings"" differs from those works is that Brandon Sanderson has done more than simply inventing characters, countries, and a system of magic. He's invented a world in which he's contemplated the full ecosystem, if you will--the weather, the creatures, the history, the lost lore, etc. To put that differently--every author has weather involved somewhere. It snows on Caradhras (Tolkien). Belgarion nearly causes an ice age with a thunderstorm (Eddings). Sanderson has taken the weather and made it into an important--though by no means fully-explained as of yet--aspect of the plot. I'm going to be interested in seeing where he goes with this one. I said I'd mention a couple of points about the Kindle edition. I would have given this book five stars, but I took off a point for the Kindle edition because I found the maps and illustrations extremely hard to read (in some cases, almost impossible). I would have liked to have studied the map of Roshar in detail, but the Kindle simply doesn't allow you to zoom in enough to do this in the level of detail I'd prefer to do. I found myself going back to the map fairly frequently, and the Kindle's ""Back"" button is very useful for returning to your point in the text when you do that. One of the lead reviews here on Amazon talks about the artwork in this book being outstanding and a rare addition to a book of this sort. That may be--but if you read it on the Kindle, as I did, don't expect much in terms of the artwork. I do not know whether the inability to zoom and move around the images is a limitation of the Kindle itself or a limitation set by the publisher. I suppose I should do some nosing around online (maybe Sanderson's site) to see if I can find a downloadable map of Roshar. The other thing I have to wonder is whether the chapter artwork might prove to have some meaning at some point. Like the other art, the chapter art just isn't really all that distinct on the Kindle, although I haven't looked at the hardback to compare it. I recall how in the Mistborn trilogy the quotations and other blurbs that began each chapter proved to be very important in terms of revealing things, so I can't help but wonder if the chapter illustrations here might prove similar. As someone who intends to continue reading future volumes of this series via Kindle, that concerns me a bit. I think on the whole the illustrations aren't a huge issue and so I'd probably take off half a point, but Amazon does not allow half-star values in rating books. Therefore, I gave four stars because I didn't think it was right to give five when I thought there was a negative that bore mention. I don't want any potential Kindle reader to get put off by my comments about the illustrations. It's still well worth the read, and it's beyond dispute that reading a 1000+ page hardback is a lot easier when you read it as an e-book compared to hauling a hardback around everywhere you go. (I was so absorbed in this story that I've been taking my Kindle with me to Washington Capitals games so that I can read during intermission and between warmups and the start of the game. I would not have taken a 1000-page book to a hockey game!)","2011-01-18","United States","","true","12","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28K7W26LX528F"
"B003P2WO5E","5","I'm covered in Sandersonspren!","There are times when I hate having grown up to be a fantasy fan. Most of the time it's when I pick up a book that seems promising - maybe because it's from a familiar author, or because you heard from a friend of a friend that it was good - but it turns out to be disappointing. Stock characters, old and tired plotlines, and a world that's basically Tolkien with some greasepaint and false noses added on. Given the number of people who write fantasy, the odds of coming across a truly interesting world with compelling characters and a story that has some surprises is difficult indeed. Fortunately, it looks like Sanderson has managed to pull it off. The world of Roshar is a strange and tempestuous place. The seasons come and go in unpredictable ways, sometimes bringing with them great highstorms that are so powerful that even the plants of this world have evolved ways to hide from them. It is a world filled with spirits, ubiquitous beings called spren, which pop up for almost any reason. There are the spren of nature - windspren, firespren, rotspren, riverspren and the like. There are spren that seem attracted to humans, like alespren, gloryspren, anticipationspren and logicspren. No one really knows what they are or why they exist, but they are everywhere in this world. The greatest kingdom in Roshar is that of Alethkar, which is barely a nation at all. A loosely bound alliance of ten high princes, the people of Alethkar are a hostile, ambitious, violent folk whose first and greatest love is battle and winning. Since the assassination of their king by the savage Parshendi, they have been involved in a seemingly endless siege of revenge on the great Shattered Plains. The greatest warriors of Alethkar - or any nation - are those who wield the amazing shardblades. Swords that seem to condense out of mist, the shardblades can cut through anything, though if they cut through a person their effects are a little more subtle. A warrior armed with a shardblade, wearing shardplate armor, can use the incredible power of stormlight to achieve feats that no normal man could survive. Bound within glowing gemstones and restored by the howling winds of the highstorms, stormlight is Roshar's greatest treasure. Within this world we follow an ensemble cast which, while adhering to certain fantasy archetypes, still is made interesting and worth watching. Dalinar, the brother to the dead Alethi king, is searching for a way to hold together the weak nation that his brother formed. He has been learning of the old ways, the teachings of the vanished and reviled Knights Radiant, in the hopes that they can help hold his people together. On the other end of Alethi society is Kaladin. Once a promising young surgeon, Kaladin joined the army in hopes of being able to fight on the Shattered Plains. He made it there, but not as a soldier - as a member of a bridge crew, one of the most expendable resources in the entire war. He became the lowest of the low, forced to find a reason to stay alive. In a city far from the fighting, young Shallan Davar has fought to become the ward of the great heretic scholar Jasnah Kholin. While she has ostensibly come to learn from the woman, her true purpose is to steal Jasnah's soulcaster, a device which, if used properly, can turn something into something else - stone into smoke, glass into blood, a man into fire. With this, Shallan hopes to revive her family's flagging fortunes after the death of her father. What she discovers with Jasnah, of course, is far, far more. Then there's Szeth-son-son-Vallano, truthless of Shinovar. Poor, poor Szeth. From a race of people known for their peaceful and easygoing natures, Szeth is the most powerful assassin the world has seen. He can harness the stormlight to manipulate gravity, making him able to do the impossible while he uses his shardblade to cut down anyone in his way. In truth, though, Szeth wishes only one thing - to find someone who is good enough to kill him, and end his tormented life. As you may have guessed, it's a complicated tale, and Sanderson doesn't hold to this whole ""Give the reader time to get used to it"" style of writing. If you're not paying attention from the beginning, you are likely to be very, very lost within the first chapter or so. But once everything settles down, the story turns into a fast-paced, multi-leveled adventure that takes place in a world that is imaginative and fascinating. The characters are enthralling, too, with many levels and - most importantly - flaws. While Kaladin is a brilliant organizer and leader, he has to fight continually against the despair of realizing what his life has come to. The easy thing would be to allow himself to die, but he knows he can't let himself do that. Dalinar, plagued by visions of what might be Roshar's ancient past, is fighting centuries of Alethi martial tradition by trying to bring the high princes together and end the war, rather than allowing it to go on. He's pulled between the love of his nephew, the king, and his frustration that the king won't be strong enough to do what needs doing. Shallan, who left her home with a clear purpose, is finding that nothing was what she thought it would be. Jasnah isn't an evil woman, despite being a heretic, and her plan to steal the soulcaster becomes less and less certain the more she learns. All of these characters are at the front edge of thousands of years of history, much of it shrouded in uncertainty - legendary Knights Radiant who fought Voidbringers before giving up their duty and turning against mankind. What actually happened is unknown, and perhaps won't ever be known. But the effects of those events echo to the present day, causing problems which our characters will eventually have to deal with. Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give to Sanderson is that when I finished the book, I immediately went back to the first page and started reading again. There are very few books that have inspired me thus, but this one did - especially after the cascading Big Reveals at the end, which explain a lot, and cast a new light on a whole lot more. What's more, I found myself wishing that I had access to an animation studio while I read the action scenes. Fights can be hard to do in written form - there's a tendency to either describe too much or too little, and very often the reader gets slowed down trying to visualize what's happening in the story. Sanderson is very, very good at writing action, something I first noticed in Towers of Midnight. Even when Szeth is hopping from floor to ceiling to wall, flinging people around like toys, the action was very clear in my mind's eye, and it's something I would love to see animated, if not done in live action. And yes, to get back to why I hate being a fantasy reader sometimes, it is the first book in a series, which means I'm likely to be following it for quite some time. There's nothing truly wrong with that - there are plenty of series that I've followed in my day - but I never look forward to the waiting game that you have to play as the author works on the next book. To be fair, though, Sanderson is busy right now finishing up my favorite series, The Wheel of Time, so I think I can give him a little latitude. In any case, if you're looking for a dense, fun new series to read, definitely pick this up. I plan on getting into some of his other books, mainly in order to have something to do while I wait for the next one of these. -------------------------------------- ""The purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon.

"B003P2WO5E","5","I AM HORRIFIED!","For some reason I had not realized that Brandon Sanderson was coming out with a new novel until I ran into a copy at a Hastings store whilst I was wasting some time. I went straight home and ordered it on Amazon (imagine my shock to find out that it hadn't been released yet - why was it on the shelves at Hastings three days early?!?). Regardless, I am absolutely horrified by this novel. You might wonder why. Please let me explain. I adored the character building that Brandon Sanderson did in Warbreaker, and was eager to read something new from him. Reading the description seemed mildly interesting, but I have to admit the major draw was having read his continuation of Robert Jordan's novel. My theory was that since I had enjoyed that, and Warbreaker, surely I should give this a chance. Oh MY GOD. I was absolutely stunned to find myself drawn into a fantastical world of love and betrayal, politics and death, class warfare, race warfare, and amazing fight choreography. WOW. Then I realized, it is going to potentially be 10 novels and I just CRINGED. I had begun Robert Jordan's work three novels into his projected 10-novel series, The Wheel of Time. Ouch. I thought I'd been smart not starting from the first novel, it saved me a few years of waiting. Sigh. I adore that series but I am tired of reading it. I want to see a conclusion to it. I say this while terribly sad, of course, that Mr. Jordan has left us. :( What a bright star the fantasy world has seen diminish in that man's passing. I do pray that Mr. Sanderson does keep this to 10 novels max, and doesn't space them out too horribly. Please, Mr. Sanderson, if you value our sanity, do not go traipsing off on too many other paths while writing this series! I get that writers have to have a break from their characters from time to time to refocus, but don't be gone too long or too often. There is a responsibility an author and reader agree to when embarking on a lengthy journey of this nature to support one another! :) Essentially, the main plotline revolves around the centuries-old fall of a group called the Knights Radiant. Their magical armor and weapons are all that remain of their protection of society against the Desolation - where Voidbringers wreak havoc on their world and their people. Very little is now known in this time of what these knights did, how they did it, or why they ultimately left. And what became of the mysterious Voidbringers? Were they destroyed? The histories are vague... In this land of Alethkar, their homes have long been virtually abandoned to fight a continuous battle on the Shattered Plains, begun after the assassination of their king, Gavilar. There is a real fear their homeland will fall while they continue a seemingly endless war against the culprits, the Parshendi, far from home. Highprinces are against highprinces, jockeying for power and position, never working together against the Parshendi, to the loss of all. Brightlord Dalinar Kholin begins to have visions of times past, coming to understand more and more of what occurred in the midst of his crazed highstorm ravings and feverishly seeking answers in the ancient book called, ""The Way of Kings"". High political maneuvering, assassinations, and betrayal haunt his discoveries and the eventual tests of both his faith and honor. And what are the highstorms? Brutal tempests that can tear flesh from bone - what are they really? Brightlord Dalinar Kholin and his virtual nemesis, Brightlord Sadeas, share an oath. A pact made upon the assassination of their last king, Gavilar,Dalinar's brother, to protect the new king - Dalinar's nephew Elhokar. But what are Sadeas' REAL intentions? Are his maneuvers still meant to protect the king? And how can Dalinar ""Unite them,"" as his visions told him he MUST do? The man Kaladin, reduced to slavery by the greed of a man he saved, does his best to survive in a world bent on his destruction. With natural leadership skills and insane fight-style, he seems to inherently become ""in charge"" wherever he goes. Desolation follows him too, as death often occurs under his leadership. But his light continues to shine, literally, as he discovers talents he did not know he possessed tied to his honor and loyalty to his men. His partner-in-crime, a spren called Syl, is a mystery. Why can this spren appear to him, speak to him, help him... in a manner seemingly completely at odds with spren-like behavior? Daily, this spren seems to become more attuned to him and give haunting hints to times past and the symbiotic relationship they must share in order to survive. His new-found gifts, too, are a mystery. Why him, why now? Shallan is a desperate young woman driven to theft in order to try to save her family's lands and titles. However in this process, she discovers there is far more going on than she ever suspected, and her family might be more embroiled in it than she could have believed. Driven to betray her brilliant mentor Jasnah, she begins to understand that she is part of an unfolding cataclysm and must learn very quickly in order to survive the coming events. In order to help herself, her mentor, and the world... she must learn. Quickly. Something is coming. In the midst of this are the magical armor and weapons of the ancient Knights Radiant - the Shardplate and Shardblades. These are bitterly fought over among highprinces and envied and desired by the Parshendi, who seem to be seeking someone or something in particular, throwing wave after wave after wave of soldiers against the Alethi. Having begun this madness, the assassin Szeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, carries the weight of countless screams... the blood of his victims... and the guilt of what he has done. It is the way, he must do as he is told by whoever holds his oathstone. Owner after owner orders him to commit murder after murder, and he always succeeds. He continues to wreak havoc to no known end. Why is he sent to do these things? What is the goal? I LOVED this book. There was so much attention to detail in the world-building and characters! I truly became engrossed in their decisions and the struggles that come from deciding exactly WHAT is the right thing to do. If you value honor and integrity and the morals that come into play with power and strife, this is the BOOK FOR YOU! The fight sequences were BRILLIANTLY written in my opinion. I could literally almost picture myself there! To me, ultimately, a book is something I read to become transported into another world - to be able to FEEL the characters - their love, their hate, their humanity, their choices, their pain, their laughter, and their progression through the adventures they have and the things they must do. This book accomplished that for me, and I can think of no higher praise from a true bibliophile. I am NOT the type to give five stars to a book just because I liked it - it has to be truly exceptional. This was. Read it. Love it. Be transported into it. There really IS another world there!","2010-09-23","United States","","true","14","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VGUJ0B1PFCAZ"
"B003P2WO5E","4","Epic Fantasy","The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson is the first book in The Starlight Archive series. This book is an epic fantasy that sets up the world, scene, plot, and characters for this series. Centuries after the fall of the Knights Radiant the world of Rosier is a world of storms and stone. There are several different viewpoints. We have main character chapters and then interlude chapters which have different viewpoints as well. I really loved a few of the characters and connected most with their stories. Shallan and Kaladin were my favorites. When I say epic fantasy I mean epic fantasy. There is so much to this book. So much back story, world building, and character development that it did take me a while to really grasp the book. I think around page 600 I was like oh yeah okay I get it now.

"B003P2WO5E","5","I have a new favorite author.","I have a new favorite author. His name is Brandon Sanderson. [image of Stormfather] This book . . . made me curse like a sailer. If I had tried to read it in public, at the very least, I would have been banned from the property. More likely, I'd have either been locked up for 24-hour observation at the local mental health ward, or locked up at the local precinct for Disturbing the Peace, but only after having passed numerous drug tests, proving that I wasn't Drunk and Disorderly. I am not exaggerating. Honestly, in a book this large, it's nearly impossible to touch on every highlight, so I'm left trying to decide which are the best . . . it's a thankless task, but here goes: Worldbuilding: If it's been done before, I haven't read it, and like Wit said, it's novelty we humans appreciate most. The majority of the world in THE WAY OF KINGS is like a tropical ocean habitat on dry land. Plants retract completely into the ground before a wagon wheel or foot can tread upon them. Instead of cows or oxen pulling those wagons there are ""chulls"" which are over-large hermit crab-sounding things. The monstrous ""chasmfiends"" the nobility hunt for sport are basically giant badass lobsters. Instead of ants or beetles scuttling on the ground, there are ""cremlings"" that sound an awful lot like crawdads. It's kind of awesome. More awesome than that are the people groups. While there were separate and distinct cultures, that wasn't the focus of the differences. The focus was on their Extras: the Alethi who fall into a kind of Berserk warrior state they call the Thrill when they are in battle. Purelakers who can communicate with the fish that fill the waters of their home. Parshendi who grow their own carapace-like armor and have legs strong enough to jump chasms in the Shattered Plains that everyone else needs a bridge to cross. Horneaters who have a kind of fairy sight that allows them to see elemental spren whether the spren wish to be seen or not. I absolutely loved it. Characters: There are so many great characters that I can only give you the gist. These people . . . I wept, but not from sadness, not from loss. I wept b/c my heart could not contain my awe and gratitude and respect for these men, these dregs of society, who one man and one spren had bound together into something so valiant, so courageous, so honorable . . . That I could do nothing but weep. Some people shy away from that sort of thing, and being the kind of person that I am, I view that as its own tragedy. Suffice it to say that if you are a character-driven reader, you will leave this world with a much expanded family. Master of Misdirection: I read this as part of a massive group buddy read (SHOUT OUT to my peeps at Fantasy Buddy Reads (view spoiler)). Several members achieved ""Master of . . . "" titles during the read, and I'm granting Sanderson Master of Misdirection status. Not only did he expertly paint characters as non-threatening nonentities so that your mind was blown when their nefarious true natures were revealed, but he stealthily laid the groundwork consistently throughout the story, making it utterly believable. But he didn't limit himself to grand scale misdirection, no, he did not. He also regularly made your heart stop for the three seconds it took to get past the obvious reaction to the reality of the situation that was entirely different from the path he had lead you down. *salutes* *fights urge to gesture rudely once back is turned* Moral Ambiguity: The singular complaint I saw voiced during the BR was that there wasn't an identifiable Great Evil that Good needed to triumph over. By the end of the book that was no longer the case, but even before that I didn't mind, b/c Sanderson constantly makes you question: what is right? What is good? It's a deliberate tactic to both make the reader really think about right and wrong, good and evil, and also to eventually make the difference abundantly clear. So if you're the kind of reader that needs that distinction, don't give up, b/c, man alive, you will get it. The last 10%: Sanderson followed a strict formula for the last 10% of his book. It goes like this: 1. What's the worst thing that can happen? Let's do that. 2. How can we make it even worse? Let's do that too. 3. Now let's make it look like---despite overwhelming odds---everything will work out fine. 4. Now let's crush that hope. Rinse, wash, REPEAT. Part IV will leave you emotionally wrung-out (in a good way), and Part V will give your FEELS a chance to recover whilst blowing your mind (really, your mind should be in pieces by the time you finish).. Having just finished yesterday afternoon, I'm surprised that I'm not still in some kind of stupor, but I've prevailed. I did have to step away several times during that last 10% to give myself a chance to recover. I used that time to: order paperbacks of both installments for my dad and hardbacks for myself, b/c these books . . . they deserve shelf space. What kept THE WAYS OF KINGS from being a 5.0 star read were a handful of issues in the beginning of the book. I've been told that WoK was shoved through the editing process to get it into bookstores quickly, and it shows in the repetition of phrases, especially in the prologue. The third time Someone came at Someone Else with ""broad, sweeping strokes"" (of his sword), I was over it. And when an Assassin continually referred to a hallway runner as being red . . . like blood . . . well, despite how fantastic the rest of the book was, I couldn't entirely overlook it's less than stellar start.

"B003P2WO5E","5","The Way of Kings","Title: The Way of Kings This is the first book of the upcoming Stormlight Archive. Author: Brandon Sanderson Genre: Fantasy/SciFi This book is the story of three main characters and there role in the world, all connected in some way. Along with Kaladin, Dalinar, and Shallan, we see a cast of supporting characters, as well as a few brief appearances by other minor characters. Most important in my opinion is Kaladin. We follow his life throughout the book in both the present and the past, and therefore spend more time with him than the other characters. Kaladin, an amazing fighter and surgeon, just as he is beginning to make something of himself, finds his whole life shattered, and all of his hopes and dreams torn away from him as he abruptly drops to the bottom of the world's order. He finds himself at the bottom of the chain, a slave, but finds there is even worse to come with the life of a Brideman. In his new life he finds death around every corner, surrounding him, making him nearly yearn for it himself. But what he instead finds is not at all what he expected. In the lowliest station imaginable, he finds not hopelessness, but instead a second chance. A second chance at leadership, a second chance at succeeding, and most importantly, a second chance in his life to protect. Along with this story line we also move, although quickly, through his life up to that point. Starting in Kaladin's childhood, and moving up months or years at a time throughout, we venture into the makings of himself as a person, and learn why he thinks and is the way he is. This gives us a rare and direct insight into the inner workings of one of the main characters, that would usually go unseen. The next main character is Dalinar Kholin, a Highprince of Alethkar. Him as well as his son, are seen at the Shattered Plains, a rugged terrain where there 6 year old war with the Parshendi, a savage sect of the otherwise meek and tamed Parshmen that serve as property of most of the civilized world. Dalinar is plagued with visions of the past, and above all a cause to unite the Highprinces, for reasons far above him, that even he does not understand. In this book Dalinar is struggling with himself, his changing views of the world, and strained relationship with his son, and with his King. His story is one of truly finding himself and truly striving to do what needs to be done, no matter the cost. Thirdly is Shallan. Shallan finds herself seeking the oppurtunity of a lifetime, to learn under one of the world's most renowned scholars, yet her true purpose is one much darker. Truly she seeks to steal a powerful item of great worth that is possessed by that scholar. Haunted by things in her past she has already done, she at first sees this as a simple task, after all, it seems it will be the only way to save her family's house after the death of her father, a secret her family desperately is trying to keep. As she becomes intoxicated by the things she is learning, and people she is meeting, it becomes something much more difficult to accomplish. In the end she has to make decisions that will decide much, life or death even. Now there are a few characters as I've stated, that only appear once in the book, and are mainly there just to show a certain place or event. The last character of import, though with little screen time, is Szeth. Szeth is a Truthless, one bound to whatever master holds his oath stone. After assassinating a monarch, he is for a while cast aside, rotting in his guilt and haunted by his past deeds, bringing him to near insanity. He is happy at least to be of no more use than a slave, at least then he wasn't made to kill. His station changes however, and he is once again forced to do acts of unthinkable atrocity and cruelty, once again and still wanting nothing more than to die. His targets become much more important, until soon, the very fate of the world could be decided on whether or not he succeeds. Ok I'd like to first say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and thought it was a great piece of literature. Brandon Sanderson definitely breaks away from many of his not much liked aspects of his writing style in this book, and definitely sounds much more experienced in his writing. One of the bigger complaints about Sanderson is that in much of his work, all the characters seem to be inherently good, and this too I think he is able to break away from in this book. I thought the flow of the book was excellent. Sanderson arranges each section with certain characters and certain parts, and then places the minor characters in between sections in what he calls the `interludes'. I thought that this style of organization works well because it keeps the main characters and unnecessary characters separate, helping along the events of the plot, and keeping it flowing well, with breaks instead of slow parts. During the beginning the only thing I didn't like about the storyline was Shallan's parts, which while interesting, I found a bit dry. I found this quality later redeemed for the most part, and also found it not that big of a deal, considering she was the least of the main characters. Overall I would rate this book a 9.5/10. I don't think I could give it a full 10, though it was very close. I definitely can't wait for the next book, and think this could be the next epic series of near Wheel of Time proportions.","2011-01-02","United States","","true","25","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U5XIS6RMSQ0A"

"B003P2WO5E","5","Great characters and an excellent innovative universe!","The Way of Kings, by Brandon Sanderson, manages to do something that is rarely seen in modern fantasy and sci-fi writing. Sanderson, by emphasizing the development of characters over small, episodic chapters (similar to George R.R. Martin's Song of Fire and Ice books) creates a world that is novel, living, and highly appealing. The world of Roshar, the setting for Sanderson's book, is lovingly crafted, with a distinct mythology that mixes elements of fantasy with a slightly science fiction twinge. Sanderson also masterfully builds a set of technology powered by gemstones and warfare augmented by ""infused"" Shardplate (a neat mix of the powered armor of Starship Troopers and magical platemail so often seen fantasy) and mysterious Shardblades. The world that Sanderson created is full of mysteries, the nature of which only become briefly delved into by the end (and clearly awaiting sequels in the series to become fully explained). The book is full of action and intrigue and, in a strange way the rich setting, the plots and wars, the powerful characters, and the slowly unveiling mysteries remind me of the first time I read Frank Herbert's Dune. The Way of Kings is a fantasy novel of the old stripe, one that builds a compelling mythology and drops the reader into lives and plans already in progress, with the sense that there is a larger picture just barely out of reach. All of this adds up to a book that is very hard to put down, a quick read despite the large page count. As I said, the driving forces behind The Way of Kings are the rich and well fleshed-out character. Unlike similar books, which rely upon a group of characters only incidentally connected to one another, all of the personalities in The Way of Kings are interesting, easy to relate to, and well-defined. I never found myself trying to rush through one character's section to get to the section of another ""favorite"" character (as I did with the Song of Fire and Ice series). All of the characters were my ""favorite,"" each story had elements that I wanted to find out more about or see more fully developed. It is a testament to Sanderson's skill that all of his characters are so compelling. Some readers might be irked, given the trend in fantasy, to not get the ""bad guy's"" perspective, or that the characters (at least in this initial book) are all relatively well seen as the protagonists of the book, but there is enough internal conflict within each character to keep the story moving without being dull. I suspect this will change as new things are revealed in the next entries in the series. In way of critique, I would say that The Way of Kings, while set in a novel world with strong characters, does tend to fall back on tried fantasy tropes. The journey of self-discovery, finding hidden internal strength, wrestling with mental demons - all of these common elements appear in The Way of Kings and some readers may be less ""floored"" by late-book revelations than others. I was pleasantly surprised by the plot twists that did pop up, however, even if they weren't exactly revolutionary and were a tad derivative. A second critique would be that this first book spends a large amount of time detailing the world and leaving a lot of open plotlines and questions. Clearly this is designed to keep readers coming back and to sell a series, and hopefully Sanderson will be able to answer all the questions in subsequent books while maintaining the momentum of the first. As a side note, I very much appreciated the more family and young-adult friendly content of The Way of Kings. In recent years, the sexual and violent content of the fantasy and science fiction genre has seemed to be increasing. The presence of a graphic sex scene or a horribly violent event in many books has become rather gratuitous, adding very little to storyline. While I am a mature adult, and don't mind this sort of thing if it is integral to developing a novel, it seems silly to include scenes such as these to simply pander to a reader's visceral senses. I am happy to report that The Way of Kings does not fall back on this, and the content is relatively PG without seeming juvenile - proving that not every entry in fantasy and science fiction need rely upon needless graphic content to seem mature and serious. Barring the intense scenes of combat, there is little in The Way of Kings to prevent younger audiences, 12+, from enjoying the story responsibly. Readers that love intricately, well-crafted worlds will very much enjoy Sanderson's new endeavor with the Stormlight Archive. The book has that epic feel that one felt when reading the fantasy of our younger days, when good squared off against an upcoming doom with honor, passion, intelligence, honesty, and sometimes pathos. A stark contrast to the new wave of ""dark"" fantasy, the Way of Kings reinvigorates the days of shining armor and sword, chivalry and majesty, and does so with powerful characters that will grab your interest and have you wanting more. In fact, the wait for book two is already difficult, and I only just now put down the book! N.B. regarding the Kindle Edition, which I read. The Way of Kings includes several interesting maps and beautifully rendered illustrations of events and people in the book. The Kindle Edition makes these a tad more difficult to see, so readers wanting better quality versions of these should think about the physical copy. That being said, the convenience of having a huge and heavy book in the small Kindle format is hard to deny.","2011-09-01","United States","","true","27","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WHIL4OQE8LVP"

"B003P2WO5E","5","Modern fantasy doesn't get any better.","Storm Father be praised, I have found it. At long storming last. For years I've searched, high and low. Six books in, The Wheel of Time couldn't do it. Wizard of Earthsea couldn't do it. None of the many fantasy novels I've picked up only to put down again in short order couldn't do it. What is it you ask? Well, let me explain. Back in 2012 I picked up Gorge R.R. Martins A Song of Ice and Fire after falling in love with HBO's Game of Thrones. I've always been an avid reader, and I credit Tolkien's Lord of the Rings with making me so. But for some reason, though I've always been a huge Tolkien fan, with the exception of the Narnia and Dark Tower books, I never returned to the genre which inspired me to read (and later to write) in the first place. A Song of Ice and Fire changed all that, and I've been looking ever since for a series match its greatness. Of course The Wheel of Time was the first place I turned, but after six overly long, yawn inducing books I don't think I have the stomach to go on. To Earthsea I went, and found its narrative boring, the style of writing not really doing anything for me. In The Way of Kings, by Brandon Sanderson, I have found that series. High praise, considering that I'm comparing it to Song after only one book, but believe me it is worth every word of praise I can give it, and then some. It is in every way A Game of Thrones equal, and if I may be so brash to say Wheel of Times superior. I realize Sanderson is a huge Jordan fan and drew huge inspiration from his work, but in this readers not so humble opinion Sanderson is ten, nay twenty, times the writer Jordan was. No disrespect intended towards Jordan, a true pioneer in the genre, but I'm sorry it’s the truth. The first thing one will notice that sets this book apart is the setting. Yes, Sanderson goes with a traditional mid-evil setting in many ways, but WoK is just as striking with how different it is. Everything about this world, from its plant life, the creatures which inhabit it, and human culture, have evolved to contend with a series of brutal storms known as High Storms which sweep through the land every couple of weeks with hurricane like winds and rain. Plants recoil into the ground when the winds approach, animals evolve with huge shells to protect themselves, and human beings build their structures with roofs slanted towards from the storms. The world Sanderson creates is truly alien, more in line with a science fiction novel then a fantasy one, though technology remains mostly fantasy based. This level of detail is evident in every aspect of this world. Sanderson creates fictional philosophers with contradicting theories regarding various subjects, religious and cultural beliefs are deep and well thought out, and its magic system is exciting and rule based. It’s hard to imagine such a thorough world exists. The level of detail poured into it is simply incredible. The characters are varied and, at first at least, spread throughout the world. From Kaladin, a slave with a mysterious past forced to make suicidal charges at enemy positions, to the artistic Shallan, and the High Prince Dalinar, every single one had me fully invested in their stories. I'm not a man prone to emotion. Rare is the film that can bring me to tears, and rarer the book. Out of the hundreds of books I've read I believe only A Thousand Splendid Suns has ever come close to bringing me to tears. So understand that when I say this book brought me to the edge of tears that I mean that as the highest praise I can possibly give. I don't think Martins Red Wedding even got that kind of emotion from me. Maybe the Purple Wedding, though that was more excited cheers then tears, I’m sure you’ll understand. Only an author with a firm grasp of his characters, their personalities, quirks, wants, desires, motivations, etc, can even hope to illicit such a response, and Sanderson has proven with this one novel that he is a master of characters. Impressive, considering how completely he mastered his world building as well. Not many writers are good at both. Even fewer are masters of them. Sanderson is one of those few. Will the Stormlight Archive prove as good as A Song of Ice and Fire? Only time will tell. One book is hardly enough to source material to make a fair comparison between the two. The stories are also vastly different, with Sanderson focusing more on mysticism and magic rather than the gritty realism of Martins tale. Even so, I can firmly say that I am more than excited to dig deeper into the world of the Stormlight Archive and follow along with Sanderson for as many books as he wishes to write. What's that? He's going to write TEN? Ten freaking books? Funny thing. After The Eye of the World, the prospect of reading Jordan's tale to the end seemed more like a chore then a pleasure. Not here. If the remaining books are even half as good as Way of Kings, I will happily read whatever Sanderson gives me.","2015-05-05","United States","","true","31","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QNFOYYW4E5D8"

"B003P2WO5E","5","An epic fantasy that you won't ever forget","It is epic, it is foreboading, it is filled with lore and it is down right amazing. The overall plot intrigue of just this first installment in the continuing Stormlight Archive series, is enticing and gratifying. I don’t read fantasy generally, though I have dabbled with it in senses of horror fantasies and some previous engagements with Neil Gaiman, and even Brandon Sanderson already. This was my second novel ever read by him and bam, what an easy hook. This book has everything. EVERYTHING. Brandon Sanderson, although relatively new to me personally, should and possibly already is regarded as one of the greatest writers of this time period. He has dynamics and characters so appealing, this will be the most interesting slow read you’ll ever have the pleasure to ingest. It’s slow in reference to action but that in no way holds this writing back. It’s dark and holds depth that will make you well up for these characters. I felt never ending impending doom the entirety of reading this 1100 page tale. And it’s only just begun. Im enthralled. I need more now. All of the build, the care and devotion into creating his lore and character ensemble. You’ll have favorites, you’ll despise others and, those who you will never trust and then the others you would trust with your own life. The imagination of this man astounds me. So many things are being alluded to the entire time but you get the pleasure of falling in love with these characters and learning about who each of them are or have the potential to be. He flaws in one area for me personally though. While his male characters are so strong in development, depth and versatility within themselves and with others which make them feel so raw and real, the women are extremely more lacking. They have some depth and some intrigue, but overall they feel extremely overshadowed and created with less care. There are far more similarities within their design then within his male characters and most do not show much of their true personalities making them somewhat tiresome to read about. It also feels as if he has a somewhat recurring theme to how he writes female characters. In Elantris, his debut novel, his male and female setups were somewhat generic and too stagnant. He had progressed extremely with all other aspects of his writing from that novel to Way of Kings, whereas his female characters seem to mimic his original creation of a female lead. It is not anywhere near making this an unenjoyable story, but it is somewhat dull at certain times because of it, and doesn’t give much way of attachment to the females. That being said, I have higher hopes for their development in the continuing series and everything else was brilliant. He has so many elements all at play, so many underlying mysteries and a tone that will change with every storyline you get into. This book probably made me experience every emotion. It hits and it hits hard. You won’t want to put this down. As you find out more and more, you’ll find yourself asking for more and more. It is masterfully written and full of heroics and depression so overpowering you will binge read to continue to get as much information as possible to stop drowning in the pain of not knowing what will happen next. What does it all mean? What is real? You will question everything but put full faith into those you trust in this book. You never know what will really happen because there’s always a seed of doubt in every step. This is war after all and all is fair in love and war. I couldn’t have asked for more out of a fantasy. I am now mid second installment and it’s just getting better. With every word I fill with anticipation. I love the dynamics and plot building. If you want to enter the world of Brandon Sanderson’s Cosmere, this is the best and worst place to start. It has so much that is tied to other areas of his works but still delivers so much on its own. This. This is what we read for. This promotes all feelings you want from a book. I don’t think I’ve read many books with this much depth and all encompassing satisfaction. This has made me a Brandon Sanderson fan to the fullest.","2020-03-03","United States","","true","39","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31JXXII3FYBM8"

"B003P2WO5E","5","Sanderson is a King","Beginning a ten book series can be daunting. It takes a kind of commitment that many of us just don't have the time for. It takes effort to stick with a single story for a decade, gobbling up installments every year or so. We're an impatient people, by and large, and waiting is something we loathe. Just look at the vitriol surrounding GRRM's prolonged release of A Dance with Dragons. Nevertheless, Brandon Sanderson's The Way of Kings, Book One of The Stormlight Archive, delivers such an impressive story that it's impossible to resist. The hardcover spans over one thousand pages, but it's populated with beautiful internal artwork that goes right along with the story, not to mention the mesmerizing cover art. TWoK is difficult to summarize succinctly. Roshar is a land wracked and ravaged by storms. These storms are ferocious and lethal, with winds and rain strong enough that to be caught out in them is to die. In part, these storms have shaped the geography, ecology, and sociology of the ten countries that make up Roshar. Some animals have developed rock-shells for protection. In some lands, the grass even recedes. The creatures and places of Roshar are as much a story as the main characters. It's obvious Sanderson has labored and put thought into his grand epic, and the thrill of experiencing these unusual settings is absolutely delightful. But more than this, tWoK is a tight focused tale centering on a trio of characters. Kaladin, this novel's major POV character, has wanted to fight in the war on the Shattered Plains for years, and he's finally found himself there, though as a branded member of a bridge crew. Bridgemen are lower than slaves, especially the bridgemen of Sadeas' warcamp. To be a bridgeman is to have a death sentence. Dalinar Kholin, brother to the murdered king that started the war and uncle to the reigning king, is a man of honor and does thing the Old Ways. He will not let himself get entangled in the squabble of politics and quests for power, much to the chagrin of the other generals, and insists on doing things Right. But when Dalinar begins having vicious dreams during the highstorms, rumors circulate the warcamps that the Blackthorn is losing his mind. And Dalinar can't help but wonder the same. The third major player is Shallan, a girl who's family is plunged into impossible debt after the patriarch dies. Shallan decides to seek out Jasnah, the king's heretic sister, and steal her Soulcaster. She'll use the money to free her family, and possibly survive the quarreling houses. But the more Shallan learns about Jasnah, the more she begins to question her motives. These three characters are the major players of tWoK, but they are by far not the only ones. Sanderson has crafted a dramatis personae filled with memorable characters, from the enigmatic Szeth-son-son-Vallano, a Truthless Shin and an angst-driven assassin, to the equally enigmatic Wit, who I'll keep silent about, to Adolin, Dalinar's up-and-coming heir apparent and established warrior on the Plains. Each person has a wealth of information and life in them, and I eagerly look forward to seeing them all develop over the course of the series. Brandon Sanderson is widely known for his unique magic systems, and tWoK does not fail here. In fact, if you've read any other Sanderson, you'll certainly notice some similarities between the magic systems, but also some very original concepts, too. As this is Book One, there was a lot introduced, but also a lot of mystery left behind the magics waiting to be revealed. I could go on and on about this book, and I really haven't scratched the surface. The Way of Kings is a solid first novel for a series. It wraps up a lot of things, not leaving too many cliff hangers, but not enough to lull the excitement, either. The stories about these characters--all of them, not just the three primaries--are amazing. Sanderson knows how to turn a phrase, as well as keep the reader turning pages, and the plot never dies down during this massive read. If you want a completely different epic fantasy, one that leaves you eager for the next volume and filled with a sense of wonder and awe, then I heartily recommend The Way of Kings. I'm invested for the duration of the series, and I cannot wait to see where Sanderson takes us.

"B003P2WO5E","4","A 1000 Page Introduction That Shows a Lot of Potential","The Way of Kings is the first novel of an expected ten in the Stormlight Archive series by Brandon Sanderson. The rather complex plot revolves, at least so far, around a conflict between the dominant empire of the time and what they see as a group of savages, fought over a massive series of disconnected plateaus called the Shattered Plains. But the novel isn't really about the war, nor is there a lot of fighting or battle scenes. Instead, the novel focuses on building up an incredibly complex, imaginative and realistic world, and populating it with a wide array of people and magic. There are quite a few main characters, but the novel focuses more on three particular ones. The first, Kaladin, is a former spearman turned slave, who is sold into a bridge crew, whose mission is to carry portable bridges into battle to allow the troops to cross from plateau to plateau, which is, in effect, a death sentence as the unprotected bridgemen are regularly struck down by enemy arrows. Kaladin struggles through depression, regret and hopelessness and he tries to find a way to save both himself and the other bridgement. Dalinar is the king's uncle, struggling with his sanity as he suffers from repeated hallucinations that weaken his position as the fractious princes jockey for power and influence. Shallan is a timid girl forced out into the world by necessity, with a dangerous goal in mind, who becomes enmeshed with one of the great scholars of the time. Sanderson typically excels in three things. The first is character development. He has the remarkable ability to create incredibly real and complex characters, and he can plumb the depths of human emotion with aplomb. Some might be put off by the fact that the main characters tend, on the whole, to be good people, so those who prefer grayer main characters may want to look elsewhere. The second thing that Sanderson excels at in the Way of Kings is in world building. I recall another review referring to the world Sanderson built as a character unto itself. After reading the Way of Kings, I can honestly say that the world is the most fascinating aspect of the novel. It's incredibly complex and rich, but shares very little in common with Earth. It has unique wildlife and plantlife that are vividly described. Yet, most importantly, it all makes sense. Some authors create weird creatures just to have something different, but in no way do they seem plausible. Everything Sanderson creates seems like it could be real. The third thing that Sanderson excels at in the Way of Kings is the development of his magic systems. This praise, like the others, is typical of a Sanderson work. He consistently manages to create unique and fascinating magic systems that are, at the same time, extremely well-constructed and follow very specific rules. This isn't vague, unexplainable power or amorphous waves of magic being thrown across a battlefield. The magic system isn't, perhaps, as well defined and manageable as was the alomancy system in Sanderson's Mistborn series, but it is still very well done. Sanderson doesn't do anything badly in the Way of Kings, but some areas are less spectacular than others. Pacing has never been Sanderson's strong suit. As with his other novels, the first 75% of the novel seems to plod on before blitzing to a conclusion in the last couple hundred pages. This weakness is more noticeable in the 1000 page Way of Kings, where it seems like 700-800 pages plod on before coming to a screeching conclusion. Although I enjoyed every page of the novel, the Way of Kings definitely moved very slowly for quite a while. A large part of this is, perhaps, that he spends so much time developing his world and his characters that he puts plot development to the side. The novel probably could have been a much tighter, more evenly paced 800-850 pages. Further, because Sanderson doesn't seem to focus too much on plot, there were very few surprises. In fact, pretty much all of the major plot turns were fairly predictable. As I mentioned at the start, the Way of Kings is the first novel in a planned 10 novel series. If each one weighs in around 1000 pages, you are looking at a major time commitment. After reading the Way of Kings, and having read five other Sanderson novels, I have little doubt that the series will be worthwhile. If nothing else, I can't wait to spend more time in the world Sanderson built. I'm giving the Way of Kings four stars, primarily because the pacing was far, far too slow and uneven and because the novel was rather predictable, but keep in mind that the Way of Kings really is just a protracted introduction. There is so much more coming, and Sanderson has laid the ground work for a truly remarkable series.","2011-03-24","United States","","true","49","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2J18CWKIMQBCT"

"B003P2WO5E","5","Highly ambitious work of high fantasy - manages to live up to the hype/ expectations","Very few 'high fantasy' books being written right now show the level of ambition and scale that this book does. I stand in awe of Brandon Sanderson for having attempted it - and for having pulled it off! I can see why he put off writing it until he was ready. as he nursed it behind the scenes, developing it over decades. Welcome then, to the world of Roshar. A planet ravaged by 'highstorms' that originate in the east and sweep across what seems to be a single landmass. Its flora and fauna have adapted to this hostile reality. It is home to a ravaged civilization thousands of years old; one that has survived several cataclysmic 'Desolations' - and another one, perhaps the final one, is about to begin. It is already an established fact that there are few authors out there that are as good at world-building or at dreaming up multiple magic systems as Sanderson. I got the sense that since this was the book/ series that he has lived with the longest - his dream project - he has really pulled out all the stops for it. I know it's a cliche to say this, but the world itself is a major character in this book. We not only discover it by reading about it, but also get to see it through some excellent artwork that intersperses the pages. The plot is a tangled but intriguing thing, and the characterization strong as expected from any Sanderson book. There are four main characters - an ageing Warlord, a slave resigned to a dismal fate (very 'Gladiator'), a precocious teenage girl who is a scholar/ artist, and a very intriguing reluctant assassin. While most of the novel is told through the four protagonist's viewpoint, there are also brief 'interludes' where the POV characters are very intriguing indeed and represent promises of things to come. This is very much book one in a long series that will see slow pay-off, and yet I was surprised by how satisfied I was at the end. This is a standalone book that can be read on its own, as each major character completes a well defined arc. Yes, the dialogue is clunky at times, especially when Sanderson is writing 'witty' lines mouthed by a teenage girl, or by a court jester of sorts. But that is the only - and completely forgivable - flaw in what is otherwise a master-work. I was delighted by how the final 6 or 7 chapters delivered one knock-out punch after another - not only in terms of action (though there's plenty of that!), but also in terms of surprising revelations. They turned my understanding of the world and the approaching crisis on its head. These waters run deep indeed. The 'many endings' were like the end of Peter Jackson's Return of the King. Where the movie made you more and more wistful with each 'end', this book just pumps up the adrenaline and excites you for the next volume. That said, I actually have book 2 right in my hand (I'd held off reading this book until the second was out, though I bought it a while ago) and it is a testament to the quality of book 1 that I am in no hurry to read it. Yes, I'll start the second book at some point, but I want to savor the end of the first, er... first. I'm an unabashed fan of Sanderson's, and have always been intrigued by his assertion that all his books happen on planets set in the same overall universe, called Cosmere. This series, conventional wisdom says, will bring that to light more than any other. Already, planet-hopping characters that made minor cameos in other books seem to have major roles in this series. No matter; you don't need to be a geek like me spending hours poring over his previous work, or online forums, or every hint dropped in the pages of this book to enjoy it as a fresh, exciting fantasy read. Right then. I'm off to wiki and those fantasy forums myself to geek out. Someone take care of petitioning HBO to make this into a series, OK?","2014-03-23","United States","","true","51","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HNGSMFTL4VEH"
"B003P2WO5E","5","Screw you Sanderson, now I'm sucked into ANOTHER epic fantasy series.","I mean I'm so hooked into Wheel of Time that I take my handle from it. So hooked, that I haven't finished it because, like a 12 year old girl, I don't want it to end (that and my extreme depression on this subject from having to throw out every book I owned in the series including the 8 chapter promo book from before it was fully released. Man I hate my life sometimes). But at least reading this I understand why Sanderson was the choosen one to finish off WoT. Something I didn't get from Steelheart. I had chalked it up to ""Younger demo"" and I'm satisfied to see that I was right. But with TWoKs I have the complaint I often have with epic fantasy. Stop nerding out so hard. So many people were like me mind numbingly bored in the first few chapters. Not even because it was particularly boring but because there's nothing that makes sense. For instance I STILL don't understand spren and how they work. I don't know if it's a universal concept, or if it's just ""Western Civ"" who acknowledge spren and there are far continents that don't see spren. I can't tell if they're visible or not because the book was never clear on that especially in the early chapters. Everyone kept talking about spren but subsequently they also talked about how sporadically they could and then could not see spren. Even now this was never fully clarified. I tried to use the maps but nothing. Maybe I'll go back and try again but what I hoped would be a valuable resource to help me fix some sort of relation between the different regions turned out to be pointless to the point where I stopped trying to look for these foreign words on the map. But once it gets going TWoK is a compelling read. A satisfying thousand page read. It's everything a movie can't be. The book eventually settles down on three major players whom turn out to have major roles in the changing of the world. While reading this book I came to a mild epiphany on what it is I enjoy about fantasy. Because I love fantasy novels and hate the overly political ones like A Game of Thrones. Fantasy is like a mystery. I love a good mystery book. It's all about unlocking the story. Trying to figure out what happened. Oftentimes in fantasy we know the tropes and authors don't stray from them. I know the heroic character will transform from slave to champion from wench to magi supreme. But the fun part the enjoyable part is trying to figure out how. To unlock the mystery of what will happen in this version. Will he arrive alone? Who will make it to the end etc etc. The best parts of this book were, for me, when I was engage in trying to figure out what would happen next. Even when I have a vague idea of what's going to happen in the end of the book I still enjoy trying to find out how things will happen. The world crafted is very holistic. Sanderson apparently spend ten years on and off working on this book and creating it's universe. He's very effectively shown one side of the universe and then towards the end he gives a hint of how much bigger the world is. As the unexpected changes plans. Tropes thought long established unravel just enough to slide into other tropes and in doing so expand the world. The next book, the recently (relatively) published Words of Radiance, promises to look at some of the over looked characters in the series. Those who weren't explored and in theory explore them. The Wheel of Time series was, as we WOTheads jokingly quote, supposed to be a trilogy once upon a time. But Sanderson shoots for heavy ambitions with this 10 book saga. At roughly a thousand pages per book that's a lot of room to fill in the world he's created. The Way of Kings does an excellent job of showing me Sanderson's go the chops to fill it out.","2015-02-06","United States","","true","52","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P1TC7WFLSJ5U"

"B003P2WO5E","5","Awesome Doesn't Begin to Describe It!","This, ladies and gentlemen, is why I read. I am going to do my best to explain why this one made it into my favorites list which is not easy to do given the total number of books I've read. First, I will say that I am a relative newcomer to Sanderson's work. I read the Mistborn Trilogy Boxed Set last year and Elantris earlier this year. I knew after just reading that first Mistborn book that Sanderson would be one of my must-read authors and by the end of that trilogy I had vowed to read everything he writes, even if it means traversing the entire Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan just to get to those final volumes by Sanderson. I had not actually intended on reading Way of Kings next, mostly because of the sheer size of it. Size, in and of itself, doesn't bother me and I've read numerous ""doorstoppers"" before. But they can sometimes seem too drawn out and slow moving and I was simply worried that the same might happen to my beloved Sanderson. But no, it was not to be. Sanderson has written the near perfect novel here. His world building, as incredible as always, is beyond my ability to describe adequately. While complicated, the cultural, religious, and political systems upon which the plot is developed makes sense and yet still does not divert the reader from where his/her attention should be focused: upon the plot and the characters. Same goes for the magic system that we get to explore with the characters, discovering its nuances at the same time as the characters. And speaking of characters, many other lengthy books or series in the fantasy genre that I've read suffer from too many characters, too many points-of-view. And there are a lot of characters here as well, but Sanderson chooses to focus on a select few so that we readers don't get bogged down, flipping back pages to try and remember who so-and-so is. And each of his focus characters is intriguing in their own ways. They have complex backgrounds and motivations and none of them are all good or all bad. They are real. And each time a new chapter opened and returned me to that particular character, I would instantly sink into their part of the story. And the plot. I won't rehash that here; I could never do it justice. Suffice it to say that all the elements of good story-telling are here: intrigue, peril, action, romance, noble honor, dastardly betrayal...I could go on and on. But to put it all together and make it soooo enjoyable requires the genius of Brandon Sanderson. Usually when I read a long work such as this, I churn through the final hundred pages or so to get that feeling of finally conquering that mountain of pages. But with this one I found myself stalling, not wanting it to end, despite its page length. As I write this I actually am feeling a little in withdrawal about the whole thing. And this is the beginning of what is reportedly a 10-book series? I don't know how I will wait until the next volume is out. I know this sounds like total fanboy gushing but reading this novel really did effect me more than 99% of the novels I read. And I'm the type of reader who likes most of what he reads. So if you haven't discovered Sanderson yet, I suggest you still start out with Mistborn: The Final Empire and work your way through from there. For me, I still have several of his other books that I still get to enjoy and by then, hopefully, Book 2 of this series will be ready. Highest possible recommendation!","2013-02-01","United States","","true","55","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SACSVP4B6SE8"
"B003P2WO5E","5","An Epic Experience","The Way of Kings is a fantasy epic that stretches the boundaries of imagination. Following three major plot lines that are expertly woven together, and numerous side plots, Sanderson fully realizes the world of Roshar. Roshar is a vast, diverse land unlike our own world in so many aspects that it is completely unique. Most of the land is frequently ravaged by ferocious high storms which has forced the land to adapt, and the people even more so. For example, in Roshar, the grass that we know fades into the ground at the slightest movement on the surface. Roshar is a world like our own in that they are at a time of crucial technological innovation and breakthroughs to secrets left from the past. The scientists call these new innovations fabrials, and they can be used in anything from heating, to a sort of email system with pens that transcribe onto sheets of paper that can be thousands of miles away. In Roshar, however, the past may have been more advanced than the present day and scientists work furiously to re-discover the technological advancements from the past. There are multiple races in Roshar, including the Shin of Shinovar, the Alethi of Alethkar, the Thaylens from Thaylenah, and the people of Jah Keved and Kharbranth, among others. Most of the book takes place in Alethkar, which was governed by ten separate princedoms until King Gavilar Kholin united them. After King Gavilar is assassinated under mysterious circumstances, his son Elhokar Kholin becomes king. King Elhokar declares war on the Parshendi, a newly discovered race who are seemingly responsible for the murder of Gavilar. The Alethi armies go to war on the Shattered Plains, fighting the Parshendi in a nearly endless battle. There are three main characters who each have their own separate plot line. Kaladin is a surgeon's son hailing from a small town called Hearthstone. As a war hero he was known as kaladin Stormblessed because of his supposed luck. Now he has been branded a slave, and must find inner peace so that he can once again try to help those around him who are in need of someone to fight for them; something that it seems he is destined to do again and again, until he succeeds, or dies trying. Then there is Dalinar Kholin, a high prince of Alethkar; seemingly the last one to uphold the ancient codes of honor and warfare. Since his brother, Gavilar Kholin, the former king of Alethkar was assassinated, Dalinar has been obsessed with an ancient book called the way of kings, which details the Alethi codes of honor and warfare as well as how a king should rule. This book has been all but outlawed and is shunned by the Alethi lords for its unusual ideals on leadership. As Dalinar also begins to be bombarded by visions during the high storms, he must choose whether or not to heed the persistent message in these increasingly intense visions; ""unite them!"" After the death of her father and the subsequent collapse of the Davar House of Jah Keved, the last but not least main character, Shallan Davar, sails to the city of Kharbranth where she hopes to study under the renowned scholar Jasnah Kholin, sister to Gavilar Kholin, the deceased king. However, her motives for seeking out Jasnah are more nefarious then simple scholarly interests as this plan that she has concocted is the last hope for her and her four older brothers to save their house. In a world where ancient evils are stirring and events are unfolding that confuse the people of Roshar, we follow three people who must find themselves, struggle with their inner doubts and emerge stronger for it, so that they may become heroes to help the people of Roshar through devastation. It seems that only by revealing the past, and learning its secrets, will they be able to unlock the future.","2013-04-10","United States","","true","56","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3H3R6J0KIMNCK"
"B003P2WO5E","4","A good start to a series in an incredibly characterized world","Sanderson kicks off his magnum opus decalogy (yes, you read that right -- ten books) in the world of Roshar. Roshar is a world battered by periodic storms -- gigantic winds travel across it from east to west, starting at hurricane force in the east and falling to mere zephyrs in the west. These winds heavily affect life: eastern life is mostly rock-based as it must be able to withstand these winds when they appear. (We don't see much of life in the west, except to know that it has soil, and some well-traveled characters who visit from the east find the ideas of soil and grass completely unnatural.) Stormwinds also supply stormlight, giving certain gems (which serve as the world's money) an inner glow for a time. If you think this might have something to do with the world's magic systems (what! a magic system in a Sanderson book? I am shocked, shocked to find such a thing!), have a gold star. The Way of Kings follows the stories of several characters: Kaladin, a soldier-turned-slave conscripted for use in the fight by Alethkar against the Parshendi, in revenge for their having killed Alethkar's king; Shallan, an aspiring scholar seeking to study under the atheist heretic Jasnah; Dalinar Kholin, a highprince of Alethkar and a leader in the fight against the Parshendi; and Szeth-son-son-Vallano, the assassin who killed Alethkar's king. The book particularly focuses on Kaladin's backstory, interspersing it with the stories of the three other characters as they progress. The world itself -- its creatures, its environment, its features, its weather -- are much of what make this book a good read. This is a world whose features strongly affect the story, to the point of its almost being a character of sorts. Throw in Sanderson's creative, patented magic systems, and you've got a winner. Storywise, however, some aspects of this book are kind of predictable. Kaladin and Dalinar are in the same place, so it's pretty much given their stories will intersect. Kaladin starts out as a lowly slave, browbeaten by the captain overseeing him -- take a guess how his status will change. Shallan aspires to study under Jasnah for not entirely noble purposes -- guess at how that secret will play out. But even still, exactly how the story plays out isn't so obviously guessable. And when it does play out, it's such a joy watching the slow reveal of the world's magic (there are more kinds than one, and we certainly don't learn everything about any of them). The world itself with its distinctive geographic features and its powerful weather system also plays a strong part in the story. So while the book deals in some tropes, it does so entertainingly. The other thing worth noting about this book is its length. I don't mind, even enjoy long books. But this one probably could have been trimmed a bit without losing too much, and probably should have. So is it the best book in the world? Probably not. But it has promise, and it sets up a world whose stories I want to read, and will read as Sanderson writes more of his grand vision. Pick it up if you like long epic fantasy and don't mind that it's going to take at least a decade to fully unwind it. A parting word on this edition of the book: I purchased the hardcover on a whim passing a bookstore going-out-of-business sale. When I opened the hardcover, I discovered that this book contains the most incredible inner artwork: twenty-plus full pages of art, illustrations of settings, beasts, and allusions not fully explained yet. It is magnificent. I was skeptical the paperback (let alone any electronic copies) would come anywhere close to doing the illustrations justice. (I usually buy paperbacks, borrowing library copies when I can't wait. And if I do buy a hardcover, I buy the paperback when it's released.) When I looked at a paperback months later in stores, I discovered I was right. The illustrations in the paperback are rubbish -- it's like you're only getting half the book that way. Don't shortchange yourself here -- get the hardcover. It's worth it for the illustrations alone. (Feel free to get the ebook too if you like portability, but beware that it can't be appreciated nearly as well in that format.)","2013-02-17","United States","","true","57","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KW3NDAH4MFAN"
"B003P2WO5E","5","A 3AM page turner, you WILL find this book hard to put down","Incredible writing and story telling. Brandon Sanderson should be rewarded with an HBO series as his content is well crafted, imaginative and constantly gripping--not wordy. This book has kept me up late nights, sometimes until 3AM reading and reading and reading, not able to just put it down when I know I've got to get up in the morning. With character development above and beyond a series like Song if Ice and Fire (with far fewer characters), above and beyond creativity in a fantasy novel since the reading the Lord of the Rings or the Dark Elf Trilogy. Sanderson weaves a world not like earth, something set more in a dessert like origin with strange bugs, vegetation and storm systems that don't mimic what we have hear on Earth. Most writers of fantasy seem to take an ""old world' view of earth and throw that into their environment but not Sanderson. A new magic system that's more subtle and mysterious along side a completely different cast system. This book brings a fresh view to fantasy with plenty of hidden mythos and dark histories not yet explained, something that will probably unroll throughout the series and lose some of its ""magic"" as you start understanding more on what is going on. One of the best parts of the book is fresh history and mystery that is yet to be uncovered (sort of like the first season of HEROES compared to what came later.) Sanderson does an amazing job of leading you down the path of the stories mythical beginnings without coming out and bluntly stating it--you have to learn as you go from characters reactions and small tidbits of history as it unravels. I'm 88% through the book and I still feel I don't have a good solid clue as to why specific wars are being fought, why the antagonists act like they do nor do I know exactly what the story is really ""about"" or where it's ""progressing"" and I really don't care! Sanderson makes you want to read more about the characters and their lives, watch them play out and get pieces of history as you go without the frustration of not having all the answers. Every night when I close the book I try to guess exactly what the purpose is for these characters and were it's going, it makes you think. The storyline follows a series of individual characters all intertwined in ways you really don't learn in this book (at least not 88% in or so) but you know deep down they're going to come together at some point. Each character has their flaws and strengths yet none of them are your archetypical hero that can just do anything they want, the characters are built roundly like any human with no single thing that has built their personality but has been molded by the experiences of their past and the world around them. You will spend a good deal of time ""flashing back"" to the past to learn a bit about how the characters grew the way they did. I am still not 100% certain who Sanderson is writing this book about, there are at least four characters that could be the focus of the book but no one character dominates (if any, maybe Kaladin). Just too fantastic to put into words, but I tried as best I could. By the second page of this book I was hooked and that almost never happens. Even deep into the book I'm hooked liked the first day. Detailed enough but not as wordy as Song of Ice and Fire series where you can skip large paragraphs and it doesn't impact the story--when I did find myself skipping or reading faster it was because I just couldn't wait to see how it was going to turn out.","2015-06-13","United States","","true","58","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L1H4HCDLARYA"

"B003P2WO5E","5","A Towering Achievement in Fantasy Writing","Brandon Sanderson’s “The Way of Kings” stands as a towering achievement in modern epic fantasy literature. The novel, the first in the “Stormlight Archive” series, is not just a testament to Sanderson’s mastery of world-building but also showcases his deep understanding of human nature and moral complexity. World-Building: The world of Roshar is meticulously crafted, with its unique ecology, diverse cultures, and complex history. The attention to detail in the setting provides a rich backdrop for the narrative and adds a layer of authenticity to the story. Character Development: Sanderson excels in creating multifaceted characters who undergo significant growth throughout the story. Kaladin, a slave turned leader, embodies resilience and moral fortitude. His journey from despair to becoming the protector of his bridge crew is both heart-wrenching and inspiring. Dalinar, representing the archetypal honorable warrior, grapples with his past and ideals in a world rife with political machinations. His evolution from a warlord to a visionary leader is compelling. Shallan’s quest for knowledge leads to unexpected self-discovery and alliances, depicting the complexity of a young woman’s journey in a patriarchal society. Thematic Depth: The novel’s themes are profound and thought-provoking. “Journey before destination,” a key tenet in the book, serves as a metaphor for the characters’ growth and the narrative’s progress. The exploration of sacrifice, duty, and the cost of doing what is right, as seen through Lirin and Dalinar’s stories, adds a philosophical layer to the novel. Epic Moments: Sanderson’s skill in crafting epic narrative moments is unmatched. Dalinar’s confrontation with Szeth and his noble act of giving up his Shardblade are moments of high drama and moral victory. The dynamic between Jasnah and Shallan, marked by betrayal and eventual reconciliation, adds layers of intrigue and character depth. Mystery and Satire: The enigmatic character of Hoid, with his cynical satire and special insights, adds an element of mystery and charm. His presence keeps readers engaged and speculating about the deeper lore of the universe. In conclusion, “The Way of Kings” is more than just a fantasy novel; it’s a study in character resilience, moral complexity, and epic storytelling. Sanderson’s ability to weave together intricate plotlines, develop deeply flawed yet relatable characters, and explore profound themes makes this book a standout in the fantasy genre.","2024-01-15","United States","","true","65","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYKS03XG8981V"
"B003P2WO5E","5","Another Fantastic Book by Sanderson","After finally finishing this book I can sit back and really think on it. I know when you see the page count, a whopping 1,252 pages, you are likely to shy away but I must ask that if you love epic fantasy please give this one a chance. It’s massive in size but there were very few chapters that I felt were “fillers” and now that I can see it all as a whole it really does feel like most of it is in fact important. But I’m getting ahead of myself. First let’s talk about the huge world Sanderson has created. One of my favorite things about epic fantasy is that it is truly epic in its scale. The author will give you not only the story, but geography, art, and literature to further the depth if the world. Sanderson does this perfectly. He gives you such rich detail in the story that you can easily imagine this world he’s created and then to add on that he gives you short quotes from books within that world at the beginning of every chapter, he gives you detailed sketches of objects and wildlife, and of course as with all epics he gives you a map and a glossary. I do have a recommendation if you plan on buying this, if you want to see the sketches in their best quality get the hardcover edition. I have the paperback and some of the written words are a tad hard to see in it. I will say that in the beginning of this you will be a bit confused as it opens with a chapter right in the middle of a very important event, and you will be introduced to a concept called Lashing. It took me awhile to get what was going on with that aspect but after a few chapters for that particular character you become somewhat familiar with it. There is also new types of creatures and inventions to feast your mind on. The characters are fantastic as well, and they each come with their own chapters through out the book. There are a few chapters for those of lesser import but the most important and main focus characters are: Kaladin, Shallan, Dalinar, and Szeth. Each gives you a different perspective of everything that is occurring and their reactions to it. I usually don’t particularly like POV changes in a book but this is the perfect way to tell this story as you get even more depth and it was extremely fun to put pieces together as it unfolded. None of the characters are truly all that similar and so they bring something unique to the table in each chapter, and I found myself looking forward to each POV change. My favorite characters over all are Kaladin and Wit, they bring a certain amount of power to the book all on their own. As a main character Kaladin has more opportunity to shine than Wit did but Wit definitely left a lasting impression thanks to his witty and sarcastic persona. Overall this was a fantastic book and I couldn’t recommend it more. If you enjoy books like Lord of the Rings or Wheel of Time then I suggest you find a copy of The Way of Kings. They even a version that is split into two books (part 1 and 2) for ease if you fear a larger book. I’ve read only one other book from Sanderson (Elantris) and I adore it as well, so I would definitely say that it’s worth grabbing and continuing on to book two when it’s released.","2015-01-24","United States","","true","66","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UXEK1116BYFW"
"B003P2WO5E","5","Believe the Hype and Hope They're All This Good","This is the seventh book of Sanderson’s that I’ve read, and this one is the best. Shocking, I know, but this book lived up to all of its hype and is now, easily, one of my all-time favorites. The characters are honorable, twisted, conflicted and gritty without becoming sordid. The landscape is beautiful and mysterious. The story is immense, but the writing focuses on just a few characters that the reader gets to know very well. The action is furious, frenetic and filled with death but is presented so clearly that visualizing the chaos is simple and extremely satisfying. And the plot, it twists. And the shadows, they hide more twists. And the dreams, they hold the most twists of all. Oh, and the ending...I love it. LOVE IT! Hrm...ahem... As a voracious SF/F reader, I’m constantly impressed at how Sanderson fills his worlds with magic and magic users, but how the magic never gets in the way of the plot, nor does it ever absurdly fly in the face of common sense (such as the magic of Harry Potter’s world, for example). Sanderson’s magic is always a perfect combination of logic and awe. Not an easy feat to accomplish. Is this series the next Game of Thrones? Well, it should be, but the books are so different in tone, style and setting that it’s hard to compare. Yes, both series have large men wielding swords, both have assassins, both have magic-y stuff, and both have epic, world spanning plots, but other than that (what’s left?), the books are very different. For one thing, the worlds are very different: GRRM sets his epic in a traditional medieval European setting, and Sanderson sets his epic in a setting that feels downright alien (the hiding grass was my favorite) - and I must admit, I like Sanderson’s world a whole lot more. Another difference is in the two author’s writing styles. GRRM is more ponderous and rank than Sanderson, who goes out of his way to make the writing accessible to today’s reader - also, Sanderson uses no swearing nor sex to get his plot across. Once again, I prefer Sanderson. Finally, the biggest difference is that GRRM lets decades pass between the publication of his novels, but Sanderson has repeatedly stated that he will release a new book in this series every eighteen months. That’s a lot of writing folks, but the man is indeed a machine. Is this the perfect book? No. But it’s immense grandeur towers over, dwarfs, and crushes any minor quibbles I might have. (In case you are curious, the one chapter that I thought was truly awful was chapter 58 wherein Adolin sits with shallow, snot-faced friends, who all act like pampered brats. I know that Adolin always talks about how much he hates The Code, but there had to be a better method of imparting this scene’s characterization without sitting through such a boring conversation with a bunch of high society mouth-breathers. The dialogue was boring, the characters were awkward, the plot came to a tumbling halt, and I don’t think anything was gained by reading this chapter. Man, this one was a bad, bad chapter.) Sanderson’s Mistborn trilogy is already my favorite fantasy trilogy, and now (barring any unthinkable literary disasters) his Stormlight Archive is on its way to becoming my favorite fantasy series. (Just don’t tell my wife - she really loves GoT…) This book is everything the reviews claim it is, and there’s still nine more books to come!","2014-08-04","United States","","true","67","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LYN4W8LIF38L"

I read a review that if you had read WoT series, go with this saga. Yep. They were right. A really fun and exciting read, though after some revelations at the end, I need to go back and read the notes at the beginning of the chapters. I really grew to love the characters and book one was wrapped up so well I didn’t feel like I was left hanging. Instead, I’m really excited to go on to the next book.

"B003P2WO5E","5","I'm hooked.","The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson I don't feel like I owe this book a review--it's traditionally published and already has literally thousands of reviews already--but I have to share. The Way of Kings is epic fantasy at its most epic. If you don't like 1,200 page novels about utterly fantastical worlds and peoples, you won't like this. It took me a while to get into it because the world was so foreign and I really had to adapt my brain to the way things worked, but oh, it was wonderful. Well, horrible in all the right places, but the book itself was wonderful. It handles some really serious issues and rides on a profound understanding of honor and justice, but I didn't feel preached at. I need to go back and steal a dozen or so quotes for my wall. Really, amazing. And the serious issues I mentioned include classism and a sort of racism, except that it isn't racism, it's eye-colorism. Although the characters do have diverse skin shades, they don't discriminate based upon skin color, but eye color. And to some degree hair color. I admit that I did skim a couple of battle scenes because blow by blow just really isn't my thing, but considering the length of the book, there wasn't much at all to skim. Sometimes long books are so long because the characters go in circles over and over in their minds, but in this case I felt that there was a perfect balance of introspection and motion. The world is so incredibly original and complex, but it fits together perfectly. No leaps in logic, nothing that doesn't eventually make sense. I whole-heartedly recommend to fantasy lovers, especially those who are looking for substance and diversity. Language: They have their own curse words, of course, just like they have their own cultures, traditions, laws, religion, and expectations. Sexual Content: Nope. A 1,200 page book and absolutely no reliance on romance or sex to keep us interested. There are a couple places when bits of romance enhance the story, but it's no kind of crutch and it stays absolutely clean. It's one thing I love about this book. Who would have thought it could be done? I briefly thought about how this could become a TV series, but then I realized that it just wouldn’t work. No incest, no adultery, no rape. Who would watch it? But I'm being sarcastic, because obviously people can live without all that crap or this book wouldn't be so stinking popular in fantasy circles. Violence: Oh, yeah, people killing, dismembering, dying, cutting up corpses. It's horrible, though surprisingly little time is spent describing gore. Overall message/theme: It's heavy on important themes, has a complicated plot that's revealed at a satisfyingly careful pace, and still character driven. It's weird, for sure, but still manages to say some serious things. I'm eventually going to have to reread it and take notes so I can discuss it with people. And put the quotes on my wall. I already bought the next book, which is even longer and supposedly better than this one. Both books are at or under $9.99 (though I got this one on sale or free, I don't remember) and for this much excellent reading material, I wouldn't blink an eye at spending the money if you like fantasy.

"B003P2WO5E","5","Perfect foundation for the rest of the series.","If you want a ""bottom line"" summary skip to the bottom: The book is a bit daunting. It is just over 1000 pages and it doesn't waste much time throwing you into the world. But here is the thing to keep in mind: when you don't fully ""get"" something in a book/series this long, don't get hung up on it. As mentioned in some other reviews, there is a lot of mention of *blank*-spren and you aren't given anything else to go on to figure out what they are. So you are left with a name and the context that the spren show up to piece it together. Some readers seem to want answers as to what things are immediately as they are introduced but half the fun of an epic fantasy series is learning about the world/characters as things unfold. You learn what things are along with the characters because it is made clear that they don't know what most of the most intriguing aspects of the world are themselves. What causes the highstorms? Who were the radiants? What are spren? What does it mean to be Truthless? The point of a book/series like this is to immerse yourself in the world and go along for the ride and Sanderson does this expertly. One review complained that Sanderson jumps around from character to character while you're left trying to figure things out. I already addressed why you shouldn't worry about trying to figure every little thing out and when he does transition from character to character he never does it at break-neck speed. The character switches are always done at key moments that leave you wanting to read more and there were several times that I stayed up late reading through a character switch because I wanted to learn more about what the previous character was doing. By the time I got to the end of the character that interrupted the story I wanted to read more of, I wanted to read more about what happened to THAT character. By the end of the book some of the characters began to overlap and because of the build up to those points, I couldn't help but get extremely excited to see how they would interact with each other. If you're still concerned with numerous character shifts, there are really only 4 main characters, one of which only shows up in the interludes between main sections. The other three characters are the main focus of the rest of the book and their stories are distinct enough that there is no real danger of getting them mixed up or losing track of one of them. Bottom line: ""The Way of Kings"" is a fantastic foundation book for a long series. Sanderson leaves you wondering about enough while still giving you plenty of character development and world-building to keep you hooked. I'm excited to continue reading about this world and it's characters. The bottom line is to not get hung up on wanting every little thing answered as it comes. If you can't stand loose ends then you shouldn't be getting into a series like this to begin with. If you're looking for an immersive, expansive, unique world that you can explore along with the characters then you should give this book a shot.","2012-12-25","United States","","true","70","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DJ5FOCD7Y0PO"
"B003P2WO5E","5","IT'S WORTH READING THE ENORMITY OF THIS BOOK","Brandon Sanderson knows how to write a character arc. The only thing I have against this book is how massive it is, which is why it has taken me so long to finally read it, and if it wasn't for people telling me how good it was, I might not have. I love being immersed in deep fantasy worlds, the time is just not there anymore-But this one was well worth the time. I’ll be honest, I was about 150-200 pages into this thousand-page spread, and I googled (very carefully) if it was worth continuing. Because I’d been introduced to multiple different characters, but I still wasn’t picking up on what the main story thread was and how it all came together. Everyone said it was worth it to keep going, so I did. Shortly thereafter, all of the pieces started clicking into place, connecting the different threads and how they related to one another, and now I don’t think there is any other way that he could have written it. And it was so good. When the character arcs all came together and how everything wrapped up in the end was just absolutely incredible. Chapter 51 GUTTED me. Shredded my soul. But that character arc was so beautifully done. Not gonna lie, anytime there were interludes I was rolling my eyes and upping the audiobook to 2x speed. I’m sure they’re important later, but all I really cared about in those moments was getting back to Kaladin 😂 I loved the theme of honor and nobility, gave me vibes from watching Lord of the Rings for the first time and the admiration for the characters and what they stood for. It was just so refreshing to read characters so full of honor and dignity. Like stories of old. I'm not even quite sure of the words to actively describe what I'm trying to convey, but whatever the specific words might be, it made me feel something. Not to mention the wit, and the worldbuilding. It took me a while to process everything because there was just so much going on. This was just so incredibly well done, and I can’t wait to read more.","2023-06-07","United States","","true","71","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DNH2VY918AAH"

"B003P2WO5E","5","This has quickly become my favorite fantasy series of all time.","Brandon Sanderson is quickly becoming my favorite author. I grew up with Tolkein, Asimov, Herbert, and other gifted writers. Though I was young and didn't understand everything on the page, the stories came alive for me. I was also a huge fan of Orson Scott Card in high school, and the past 15 years of George RR Martin. In my opinion Brandon Sanderson might just beat them all. I know that will be taken as blasphemous and borderline heresy, because Tolkein and Asimov are considered two of the greatest writers of all time. Just hear me out as to why I think Sanderson has something special with this series. The Way of Kings is the first in a planned 10 book series in the Stormlight Archive. These 10 books take place on a planet called Roshar, a planet with a unique and rich history. While humans are present, the world is very different than our own. The world is a very unforgiving place, with hurricane level storms traveling across the world every couple of weeks, giant crab like crustaceans roaming the world, and trees and other plant life have evolved a rock-like resilience to the elements. Right away you can see that this differs from the more traditional fantasy worlds of other authors. As if this isn't interesting enough, Sanderson goes one step further and introduces a magic system that hasn't been seen before. I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil it, but the discovery of this ""magic"" (if it can be called that) is both interesting and refreshing. Though this book and presumably all books in the Stormlight Archive will take place on the planet Roshar, Brandon Sanderson has done something even more ambitious with his books than other authors have attempted in the past. He has other series, such as Elantris, Mistborn, Warbreaker, etc that take place IN THE SAME UNIVERSE. Though these books take place in the same universe they take place on different planets, with different magic systems on each. How are there different magic systems? Well there is an explanation, (a really good one I might add) but for it to make sense, you really need to read the books. Do you have to have read one series first to enjoy another series? Absolutely not! That said, if you HAVE read some of the other books, there are numerous ""Easter Eggs"" that you will discover in some of the books that will make you smile. There is an over-arching plot between all of the books in each of Sanderson's series in the Cosmere Universe, but that plot is still in its infancy. Sanderson has said he knows his end game, and thankfully he is a very fast writer. It is amazing to me that Sanderson can write so quickly and yet so well at the same time. The character development each of the characters experiences is amazing. Each is well written, and even though I get annoyed at some of the decisions the characters make, I am not annoyed at the WRITING of those characters. The characters don't always make the best decisions, because Sanderson writes them as humans, and humans make mistakes. There are twists in the books that would rate very highly on the M. Night Shamalayan scale. There are very few books that have made me tear up as if someone cut an onion in the room, but for some reason this book (as well as Words of Radiance and Oathbringer) has made me do so. Do yourself a favor and buy this book. There's humor, romance, comedy, drama, and best of all, GOOD WRITING.","2018-01-30","United States","","true","73","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMOA3NAI7JDP5"
"B003P2WO5E","5","Amazing! Read it.","Did I enjoy The Way of Kings? I think I can safely assure you I did as I am currently rereading it. Look at its length and you’ll see what I mean. There are a lot of factors going on in this story, but I want to quickly (as short as I can) summarize the book as there are other detailed reviews concerning it. First, things I disliked: I couldn’t concentrate on anything else while I was reading it. Since I’m currently in school it was problem. So I suppose you could say that it is a positive, maybe, that I was so obsessed with the book I couldn’t put it down. Actually to be honest, I have nothing bad to say about it. Unless you hate long books, then I’d recommend you stay away from this. Things I did like: I loved Kaladin. I thought he was an intriguing likable character. Throughout the story I was on the edge of my seat begging Sanderson to not hurt my favorite character. Whether or not he did. . . well, you need to read it yourself. But in today’s fiction, it’s impressive if an author manages to convince me to actually LIKE his character. The way his story is told was interesting, different. Who he was, who he became are in some ways blurred. The oddest thing about Kaladin was the fact that he changed and yet he remained so much the same. I can’t explain it quite right. If you’ve read Sorrow, Memory and Thorn then you know what I’m talking about. Needless to say, he was fascinating and I would continue to read the story simply for his sake. I loved the world. It was so different and so familiar that I was delighted. Sanderson creates a believable world that I adored. It was scary, mysterious, comforting, and sprawling. I would love to visit it. The creatures, the high-storms, and the people were vivid and captivating. Again, I’d continue to read the story simply for the world building. All the characters are different, well-written, and likable. They each have their own struggles, their own strengths, and their own style. The world is fabulous. Have I raved enough about characters and Roshar? But this is my favorite part: the moral questions the story raises. I am convinced the “simple” questions are the deepest hardest ones to answer. Sanderson questions throughout his story: what is leadership? What makes a leader? How is good leadership shown? It is profound thinking that I was left to ponder far after the story had finished. The questions it also asks about religion are probing too. What if a society builds everything on a religion only to have the religion be wrong? What makes a religion right? Is it okay to believe something personally even if it’s wrong? I don’t know. The questions though make the story. It leaves an impression far deeper than a simple fantasy tale. You are left looking at your own world more thoughtfully. That is a good author’s mark and I am thoroughly impressed! If you dislike long books, don’t read it. If you dislike profound questions, avoid this book! Otherwise, enjoy this book! I know I certainly did.

"B003P2WO5E","5","Amazing Read!","This book is simply amazing with an incredibly detailed world and excellent character development and I felt compelled to write a review so others could get excited and take the plunge into this 1000 page book 1 of 10 adventure! Here's why I couldn't put this book down: I've always enjoyed reading Brandon Sanderson's books because he does such a wonderful job of creating believable and interesting characters filled with emotion that connect me as a reader to their stories. Although this book has several character arcs going on at the same time, they are each interesting and I never felt upset about leaving one arc and going to the other arc. Also the pacing between arcs kept me excited and I never felt bored with any of the stories. Each also had a bit of mystery and intrigue and not all the arcs get completely resolved at the end, leaving a few mysteries for the next book as a tie-in. I also thought it really cool that the end of the book brought closure to the prelude and opened up a whole 'Oh Dear' wellspring of thought for the next book. To accompany character development, Brandon has also created a very rich and diverse magic system, multiple religions, ancient artifacts, and current mechanical-magical inventions to add to the mix. Couple this with murder-mystery intrigue, political maneuvering, fighting, philosophy, romance, laughing, crying, and unexpected twists and you get everything you could possibly want in a fantasy epic. The other incredible feature about a Brandon Sanderson book is the care he takes to develop the world and this book tops his others. I've read other books that had incredible storms or made up creatures but this is the first one I've ever read that had such widespread flora and fauna adapted to the world in such an integral way. The world feels very oceanic-based but without the water - most animals are crustaceans and tree leaves and grass act like a sea anemone and withdraws when endangered. I got great enjoyment during one of the interludes where a woman visiting a rare Earth-like region where the grass and trees didn't react compares this to a ""man who was born without all his brains, one who didn't know when to protect himself, but instead just stared at the wall drooling."" The Shattered Plains is a also a very interesting geographical feature which provides a unique twist as arrmies struggle to get across numerous chasms to engage the enemy quickly. The artwork adds a very special element to the book and really helps bring this world to life. Drawings of plants, animals, buildings, and unique geographical features allows the reader a detailed glimpse into the author's visions and really adds to the enjoyment of this world. I hope we get more art in future books! I'd actually recommend buying the hard back just for the art. This is a really great beginning for an epic saga. I'm definitely excited about seeing the rest of the series and truly hope Brandon Sanderson can keep the momentum and excitement going throughout (and the art!).","2010-09-04","United States","","true","78","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZTYHS8PFX5LA"

This is part of a series called the stormlight archives, which is apart of a universe called the cosmere!

"B003P2WO5E","5","Mr. Sanderson keeps his promises!","Admittedly, I was a little intimidated by the length of this book and the prospect of having to read the whole series to get the full story. However, within a few pages, I was swept into the world of Alethkar and found myself rooting for the characters. I won't describe the whole book - that's for you to enjoy - but I will point out in general what I enjoyed. The author does a great job of describing the characters in a way that doesn't bog down the story. He puts in interjections of how they look and think throughout the story, and you see the characters grow as the story moves on. Several times in the book, he does a ""flashback"" to an earlier part of the character's life. IN OTHER BOOKS, this can sometimes get kind of boring as you want to get back to the action. However, through the end of this book and much of the second book in the series (more on that later), Mr. Sanderson rewards you for sticking through those flashbacks as they reveal and aspect of the plot or character that comes up later. The plot itself consists of many threads that at first seem only superficially connected, but as you weave through the book you see that the characters and their activities all flow towards each other. In this way, I found this to have a lot of tension, which was great overall but frustrating because I kept thinking to myself, ""I want to find out where this goes, but I know I have to wait several chapters!"" However, despite this, I have come to trust the author and know that I will be rewarded for paying attention in a most spectacular way. The author describes the setting quite well. Although visually I harken to other fantasy worlds or analogies to our world when he describes Roshar (the planet they are on)...the world is quite unique and pleasing to imagine. Within that, the systems of magic, spiritualism, and hierarchy of politics are both familiar and unique at the same time. Brandon does a great job of giving you what you need to know to keep the story moving without ploddingly describing how everything works all at once. He makes you think, which is another thing I enjoyed about the book. If I had to come up with any criticism it would only be that this type of story is not for everyone. If you read this book, you are committing to reading the rest of the series (in my opinion). Although the end of the book is satisfying in itself, it definitely leads right into the 2nd book of the series (which I'm currently finishing up). If you like the more direct and quick action and resolution of shorter stories, you will not get it here. However, if you enjoy immersing yourself in a world and following its deep and rich main characters for hours (of reading time) and putting some thought and effort for a satisfying reward, this book could just be for you.","2018-09-11","United States","","true","80","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PSMCMXV2S1QF"
"B003P2WO5E","5","Sanderson Keeps Getting Better","First of all, do yourself a favor and pick up the hardback version of this book. Physically, it is a beautiful book with an imprint of a sword on the front and gorgeous full-color artwork in the front and back. Additionally the book contains frequent illustrations that are expertly drawn and do a great job of filling in little details without going so far as to completely remove your imagination's part in rendering the scenes. At over 1000 pages, this is a hefty book that seems daunting at first glance and could understandably lead a potential reader to assume that he or she would be in for a lot of filler and fluff. Let me put those fears aside for you- this is a serious page turner with almost no wasted space. I found every chapter to be either directly or indirectly relevant to the plot. Even the interludes served to fill in a little more detail about important people or places without being entirely unrelated to the rest of the book. The fantasy world that Sanderson has crafted is one of the best of its kind. There is magic, but at least in this first book, it mostly integrates in a logical, realistic fashion. Yes, there are a few soldiers storming about with the fantasy equivalent of power armor and lightsabers, but the author ensures that these men are not invincible and serve a logical purpose within a larger army. The greatest magic users, known as Soulcasters, are able to transmute matter from one form into another, and are naturally a vital resource of shelter and supplies for the armies represented. The ""fuel"" needed to perform these tasks is also, again logically, a central part of the battles. There is an incredible amount of detail beyond the magic system, including the cultures of the land and the organization of the armies, but what is perhaps most impressive is that these details are revealed naturally during the course of the story. Sanderson practices ""show, don't tell"" very effectively in this regard. The handfull of main characters are interesting with well developed backgrounds who most importantly act in a believable, human fashion. I really can't stress that last part enough. At no point was I frustrated because the characters were ""playing dumb"" for the sake of the story, as is often the case in fantasy novels. These characters have strong convictions, but each one changes his or her mind or compromises on points either do to natural character progression or urgency. Finally, I'd like to note that while this is the first book in a planned series, it stands well on its own as a complete story. I was left wanting more and excited about the next book, but I was not left feeling unfulfilled. The characters all reached important milestones near the end and the major plots reached good points to pause at. Furthermore there is no ""all is going according to plan until the last two chapters and then everything falls apart"" moment that marginalizes the characters' efforts and has become so cliche for books with planned sequels. Five stars, excellent read, can't wait for the next one.","2011-09-21","United States","","true","81","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24BAXH9HHYM8S"

"B003P2WO5E","5","It is good","I don't know where to begin. I don't think I can write a review worthy of this book, either. First I should mention that I have read all of Sanderson's novels thus far, excluding the final Wheel of Time book. After I read the final Mistborn book I mentally sat in the corner and cried for a week or so, but I think that's what I seek most in Fantasy. I think my favorite thing about Sanderson's writing is how he leaps around from character to character flawlessly. At first I was a little overwhelmed by all the jumping around, but I think that that only makes it stronger. I settled into it quickly enough, and started really enjoying all the different settings that Sanderson has created. Way of Kings, like all Sanderson's other novels, is layer upon layer, and the unwrapping in the tale is believable but still titillating. Obviously I'm struggling to write this but I don't know how to express how much I loved this book. I desperately want to know more about Dalinar and his past. I want to learn about Szeth's and Kaldin's powers. And I desperately want to unravel the truth behind the desolation and the High-storms. The only negative to this book, I think, is the character Shallan, but I think that that is because I don't like the type of person she represents. I am still giving this book five stars because Shallan is tolerable and Sanderson more than makes up for her with the other fantastic characters. I love this book, I know others may not, but I think it is wonderful and I anxiously await its successors. Now to talk about my problem with Shallan. In general, I think she is sort of annoying. She has this sort of subtle little-miss-perfect attitude that I can't stand. It's not that I didn't find myself rooting for her, it's just that sometimes I had to roll my eyes. I think maybe the problem here is that Sanderson has more trouble writing from the viewpoint of a teenage girl, though maybe not because I loved Vin in Mistborn. I guess that maybe Shallan's attitude corresponds to that of a lesser noble-type, but that doesn't make her any less annoying. I hope that she will change a little in the books to come. I did like the plot line surrounding her, though, and I like Jasnah quite a bit. But I do have to rant about one more thing. The concept of her memory snap-shots made me want to hit my head against a wall. I am an artist and as one I can say with certainty that that is not the way it works. I understand it's fantasy, but the concept of totally photographic memory is complete bs, and I wished Sanderson could have avoided that. But I guess it was rectified with some of her other abilities as a soul-caster. But seriously, no one can look at something and memorize the image totally. That is stupid beyond belief. Anyway, that is my rant. I give this five stars anyway because everything else is amazingly well-written. I loved it!","2011-11-14","United States","","true","83","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BTPK6JYU62FJ"
"B003P2WO5E","5","Please survive long enough to finish the series...","Robert Jordan sort of had the last laugh on a lot of us when he passed away before finishing the Wheel of Time. Brandon Sanderson, who is finishing up Jordan's seminal fantasy series, seems to have gotten a bad case of 'Encyclopedic Fantasy Novelitis'. With the first edition of this multi-tombed series topping off at 1,008 pages, and the well known phenomenon of fantasy series novels getting longer as they go, we may be looking at 15,000 plus total pages by the time that this series finishes. That being said, I cannot think of a single time during the reading of this book that I ever felt bored, annoyed or anything other than totally absorbed in the richly detailed world described by Sanderson. The world is described down to the level of how grass would evolve in a world without top soil (think underwater tube worms)and how some races of people have physical traits such as metallic hair accents, inherently two-toned skin and kevlar-like armor plating in place of skin. Don't worry though, you won't have to suffer through descriptions of 'smoothing of skirts', the internal musings of unimportant characters, or extraneous plot lines. In this regards at least, Sanderson has learned the lesson that I wished Jordan had learned around book 3 of the Wheel of Time series. All of Sanderson's observations of his creations add flavor rather than simply adding verbiage. This book features plenty of combat, and the tactics and weapons are new and interesting. Most of the book though allows several characters to be very well developed, and I assume that this development will be critical to the plot line as the series moves forward. In fact, some reviewers have criticized the book for really beginning in the last 100 or so pages of the book. I understand their point, but I disagree. One of the greatest assets that Sanderson brings to novel writing is a vivid sense of character development. All of his novels benefit from characters that we can actually care about, flawed though they may be. Perhaps the most compelling character in this novel is Kaladin. Much has been said by other top reviewers, but I find his development compelling. I also find Sanderson's observations on leadership, as illustrated by Kaladin's story, to be richly nuanced and insightful. These are lessons in this portion of the story that should be learned by all leaders. A couple of other notes. This novel, as all Sanderson novels do, has a fair share of strong female characters. Violence is real, but it is not glorified. Rather, war is treated as a painful reality with real consequences for real people. Finally, there is a strong moral sense to the book, without and sense of preaching. I highly recommend this book, and hope that Sanderson is taking good care of himself so that he can live long enough to complete the series, probably around 2022 or so.","2010-09-27","United States","","true","84","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LMNWVX6W5FI4"
"B003P2WO5E","3","Has great potential","I've read the Mistborn books, Elantris and Warbreaker. I've also read the one released Wheel of Time book authored by Brandon Sanderson. Brandon Sanderson excels at clever and rational magic systems, complex world building and writing many words without being repetitive or seeming like he's being paid by the word. He also did an amazing thing with the Wheel of Time in that he told a great story and still managed to cut out the excessive ramblings favored by Robert Jordan and RJ's second rate editor. The only issue with Brandon Sanderson is that I sometimes find his conversation awkward and his characters a little less than three-dimensional. Warbreaker especially was a little wooden in delivery, it seemed to me (although I thought the Warbreaker plot was fantastic). So I went into the Way of Kings with some trepidation, but knowing that I'd probably like it regardless. Unlike many, I had no feel for length or size of the book as I bought an ebook. I knew it was long as I'd read in his blog about how it would be epic in size and length. It sounds like I made a good decision and that, when it comes out in paperback, no normal book glue will hold it together. The book started out slow. I didn't care for Shallan at first. However, her development was interesting and I found myself interested despite her slightly difficult-to-believe motivations. Kaladin also felt somewhat contrived at the beginning. I made headway slowly. I liked Szethe, despite his silly name. I also found the Adolin/Dalinar characters difficult at first. Everyone felt a little contrived. I say this because I want you to know that the book gets better. The characters do grow over time and become more interesting. I suspect that my re-read when the next book comes out will show me liking the characters a lot more because I already know them. The world building is complex and interesting. The evolution of the natural world, in reaction to the strong elemental storms is fascinating and I love that he comes up with this stuff. Politically I was lost for some of the book. Light eyes and dark eyes were ok, but there were some shifts between cities and people that I wasn't always following. It did all come together in the end though. Again, a re-read will probably bring me much satisfaction. The hints of history revealed throughout the book offer increased depth. I can see that this story will be long in the telling. Some of the plot reveals at the end were unexpected (although I don't tend to over-analyze until after a book is finished)and made me excited for the next book. The ending of Kaladin and Shallan's plot lines were interesting, satisfying and even a little heartwarming. I found myself liking just about everyone at the end. I admit to a preference for Dalinar which probably means he's going to die horribly in a book or two, knowing my luck. I also liked Jasnah quite a bit. Adolin might grow on me with time. We'll see. He has potential. A few awkward moments that were really jarring for me: at two different points in the book, two different characters used the word, ""Wow!"" I'm not a fan of modern slang in my fantasy novels and it took me a while to get over it. There were a few different slangy spots in the book. Those spots, along with Shallan's iffy plot motivations and some wooden characterizations at first are what contributed to my 3-star rating. However, I went into the book with expectations very similar to what I found and was in no way disappointed by The Way of Kings. I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to someone who likes dense books with complex world building and political situations, as long as they were willing to commit for the long haul as we wait each year for a book to come out. It's very likely that this series of books could progress to a 4 or 5-star rating in my overall repertoire. See my profile for how I rate books. A 3 is very good and I'd go so far as to call it a 3.5.","2010-10-31","United States","","true","85","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2O56W8L6J65EE"
"B003P2WO5E","5","Character and world building like none other, this will be a classic it's so great","WOW! OK I came from the Wheel of Time series where I thought Sanderson did a great job, but did not think he was the same caliber as Jordan. But at the same time (no disrespect intended to Jordan, RIP) I was grateful that Sanderson was able to move along the story, and finally minimized the incessant henpecking, nagging, and looking down the women of Jordan's universe did. I was quite unsatisfied with the Wheel of Time's ending and think Sanderson dropped the ball on that, but ok this isn't about that. I read a few of Sanderson's other stuff and haven't been really impressed, writes great but not a great writer...yet. Well I picked up this book mainly because Michael Kramer narrates most of it (WOW, if you haven't heard him you need to get the audio book), he also narrated the WOT series. The book starts off very slowly, but you have to realized it's a 10 book series and what Sanderson is doing is setting the stage, but more importantly he is fleshing out the world and characters. His attention to detail is AMAZING, and the depth of character is completely unparalleled IMO, even by Jordan who seemed to spread himself too thin among way too many characters. Once again referencing Sanderson in WOT what he did in the final few books was really concentrate one character, sometimes minor ones, and flesh them out over a few chapters and really get you into them. Well what he does here is take the entire book to flesh out 3 main characters, and to a lesser extent the 4th main character Szeth, and also really really flesh out every character, location, motivation and mythos around those main characters. By the end of the book I really felt I knew them personally, sometimes forgetting myself and even becoming that character while I read. The world building is also wonderful and so detailed, yet realistic you believe it is true in a far off world. The weather plays such a huge part in everything and it's fascinating and entrancing to see it unfold hand in hand with the characters, especially Kaladin. Folks, this is one you cannot miss. There is a decent amount of action, but don't go in expecting it to be action packed. The beauty is in the characters and the world, and just how incredibly immersive their past and present lives become in that world. With this book I can truly say Sanderson IS a great writer. Can't wait to read the 2nd one, then complain about how long the 3rd one is taking to come out only because I want to read it so much. Oh and by the way, he still hasn't topped the tower of Ghenjei chapters in the WOT series, but I'm hoping he does!!!","2016-12-04","United States","","true","86","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDOPTEAS5EG03"

"B003P2WO5E","5","Incredible!","Minor spoilers ahead: This book has blown me away. Normally with books this long, you expect the story to slow down but that was not the case. Like the highstorms described throughout the story, this story was a tour de force. From start to finish, I was intrigued and moved. This is probably one of the best books I've read in the last 5 years. The story is told from the perspective of several characters; Kaladin, Dalinar and Shaladin being the main ones. The main story opens with a key event, the assassination of the King that will change the future of the nation of Alethkar. We are introduced to Dalinar Kholin, warrior, leader and uncle to the current King. Through Dalinar, we see the war between Alethkar and the Parshendi forces. Kaladin Stormblessed, the son of a surgeon, warrior with a heart of gold. Shallan is the artistic noblewoman who becomes a ward of the renowned scholar, Jasnah Kholin. Sanderson writes one of the most fascinating characters. I found Dalinar and Kaladin refreshing and entertaining. Kaladin is our hero, but he is a true hero in the sense that we see his weaknesses, we know his struggle, we live and feel it through each word. We see the youth who naively saw the world one way become a cynic. He was beaten emotionally and physically and was close to giving up completely, but he managed to pull himself out of it all. He dragged himself out of the despair and clawed his way out of the darkness inside of him. The void that scared him. I rooted for Kaladin the entire time, several moments in the story had me panicking (I've read the Mistborn series and I just could not go through another Kelsier moment). Dalinar reminded me of a ""good"" Tywin Lannister. He is a man of honor and loves his family. His sense of duty and the code of honor he tried to follow was really admirable. This is a man who had lived his life one way and reflected on his mistakes later on and tried his best to be better. That is something that I could respect and Dalinar's interior struggles also made his character seem even more real to me. Sanderson manages to make these characters relatable on a certain level, not only because they are flawed but because they have heart. That is what makes a good story, having characters that you care for and want to learn more about. The prose is fluid and it doesn't interfere with the rhythm of the story. The plot was well constructed. At times it seemed predictable, but there were enough surprises to keep you wide eyed and wanting more. Way of Kings was an enjoyable reading experience and it's definitely one of the books that I will read more than twice...perhaps even five times. If you're a fan of Sanderson, you will definitely enjoy this book.","2014-06-28","United States","","true","88","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCWJTEKUCFTRO"
"B003P2WO5E","5","The Way of Masters","Many other reviewers have left very good and detailed glimpses at why this book by Sanderson is so exceptional. For that reason, I will refrain from writing another 3000 word review. So, if you want details about the book, its characters, and plot, please look elsewhere. I just felt that Sanderson deserves one more great review. So here is a brief overview of why this book is a fantastic addition to the fantasy genre. The Way of Kings is really, really good. Brandon Sanderson has created a genuine work of art. It is clear that he poured much love into this project. His world-building and imagination is phenomenal. As other reviewers have mentioned, some people complain that this book is LONG. Well it is, but in a good way. Unlike many other stories you do not instantly fall in love with Sanderson's characters. In fact, I found them to be somewhat boring at first. However as I continued the story I found myself appreciating this a little more. The characters Sanderson introduces become very real, and the world they find themselves in is completely believable. It is full of mystery that unlocks a little more as you go along, almost as if I were building a close relationship with a long-time acquaintance that I just never took the time to get to know. The story continues to charm, shock, and intrigue. A little patience really pays off here. I found myself empathizing more and more with the characters as the story unfolds. To me, it added to the believability of Sanderson's world and to the retainment value of his projected series. I will eagerly await the second book of this series. I like the time that Sanderson put into developing this story and I enjoyed the ""slowness"" of the world and character building. It makes the reader care more about this world. A Way of Kings is slow and methodical without being boring (especially the first 500 pages). In the first half of the book nothing that extraordinary really happens, but I didn't care at all. That speaks volumes of the author's quality. Still, the book is set with moments of combat, betrayal, mystery, philosophy, religion, and political intrigue. The setting of Roshar feels eerily ""real"" and believable while simultaneously remaining refreshingly fantastical. I like it, and I was encouraged that many other readers do too! This is a story that the reader can get lost in for its highly imaginative and well-thought-out nature. A Way of Kings is a masterful debut title of the projected 10-book ""Stormlight Archive."" I'm looking very forward to the second. IMHO, If Sanderson retains his quality of authorship throughout this series, I would dare say that this could turn out to be one of the finest examples of fantasy literature ever written.

"B003P2WO5E","4","Not bad writing, just not great","I read about 200 pages. I might eventually finish it, but it's not really the kind of writing I enjoy. I liked Kaladin as a character. He is very intriguing and well developed. The writing itself is decent. However, I have trouble reading all of the seemingly disconnected parts that pepper throughout the book. Some say it is world building, but George R R Martin was able to build a very vivid and realistic world without deviating from the storyline. This book consistently divulges bucket loads of unnecessary ramblings that have nothing to do with the storyline, but perhaps, are for the purpose of world building. After getting 200 pages deep, I started reading Mistborn, and said to myself, ""Mistborn is an amazing storyline right out of the gate!"" Therefore, I realized that Brandon Sanderson is perfectly capable of writing a book with an awesome storyline, and perhaps, this particular book just isn't for me. So, I am putting this book down and reading the Mistborn series instead. Because of this, I am giving 4 stars rather than 3 because Sanderson is a good writer; it's just this particular book is not good for me. If the storyline of Mistborn remains as intriguing as the beginning, I will be giving that book 5 stars when I review it. So, do not be deterred from buying Brandon Sanderson books if you do not like this one as I don't. He has other better books out there. And perhaps, you will be one of those people who like this one as well. If you enjoy reading dumps of unnecessary information that don't relate to the storyline, then this book might be for you.","2023-04-07","United States","","true","91","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KMWCBO3EGIO"
"B003P2WO5E","5","thanks to that amazing ending! Here's the review","5 amazon stars for this one, thanks to that amazing ending! Here's the review, free of spoilers as I have goodreads friends who have just started reading this book. So Way of Kinds is set in a fantasy world that's essentially a never ending high desert type of landscape. There's magical spren creatures, catastrophic storms are normal, and men fight in special armor with special blades that can cut anything and kill anyone. A unique take that's a far cry from the normal thick wooded areas of most high fantasy settings. So it's got that going for it, and Sanderson was very skilled in weaving many, many aspects seamlessly into one solid world. Even the currency is based around the storms! Well done! There are essentially 3 main characters, with a good number of side and supporting characters that all work independently towards separate goals with their own ideals and attitudes. Great stuff again, and the plot REALLY came together in the end with so many ""Ah-ha!"" moments that just made me want to dive into the next immediately! Between the world building, the characters, and the plot, this book had all the makings of a 5 star piece of art. So let me just tap on real quick why that last star got knocked off. 1) I got the feeling that Sanderson doesn't do villains very well. Not one single character felt ""evil"" per se. Minus one exception, all characters did the bad things they did without coming across as bad people. Even the assassin slaughtering thousands of people was just mired in guilt throughout the whole thing, which seemed annoying to me. In fact, most characters seemed far TOO honorable to me, especially Kaladin. I realize he's supposed to be mister-goody-two-shoes, but wow Sanderson. This guy's guilt over losing people was so severe I felt convinced he wasn't human! I'll just be honest. I don't like Kaladin as a hero. To me, he's a whiny little bitch who needs to grow up, who's only saving grace is that he isn't afraid to fight. 2) Between about 40% to 75% of this book, the writing dragged on way too much for me. Sanderson has this tendency to ask redundant questions and them answer them with a ""no"" over and over again. ""Should I abandon my kingdom? Leave my friends? Forget everything I've ever learned? No."" ""Can it be me? Have I done this all before? Can I truly have seen this coming? No."" Basically, several paragraphs of inconclusive inner dialogue that by 50% in, I just started skipping altogether. By the end of the book, whenever I saw a spree of question marks at the end of a paragraph, I'd skip that paragraph and the next one, and I never felt like I missed a thing. But yeah, besides those two things, great book! Totally going to dive into the second one right now!","2015-11-08","United States","","true","92","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2P5J1IZDH069O"

"B003P2WO5E","4","Loved this book","This is a book that I've wanted to read for years, but I've always been a little daunted by its size. If you haven't seen The Way of Kings it's about 1,000 pages. I usually love Sanderson (he's probably my all-time favorite fantasy author), but I just didn't feel like I had the time to dedicate to reading this book. That changed when I started driving more than an hour a day and decided to take the plunge into Audible. I bought this book with one of my first credits even though I owned the paper copy. At 33 hours, I figured I could complete the book in about a month, especially since I upped the speed. In all, I did really enjoy it. The Way of Kings follows three main characters: Shallan, Kaladin, and Dalinar. Shallan is a girl from a destitute noble house. She tracks down Jasnah Kholin, the princess, in an attempt to become her student and steal her magical device. Kaladin is a slave who was once a soldier. He is transported to the Shattered Plains, the sight of a prolonged war between races. Once there, he is assigned to Bridge 4, the worst place for any slave, essentially a death sentence. Dalinar is a prince, the brother of the murdered king. He is honor bent, determined to hold to the codes. By the end of the book, the characters' stories do start to meld, and it is apparent that they will continue together in future books. I did ultimately enjoy The Way of Kings. Somethings that I loved about it: Sanderson is a master of magic. I love his magic systems in all of his novels, and this one is no different. Sanderson is also a master of planning and foreshadowing. One of the great beauties of all of his novels, in my opinion, is the amount of careful planning that goes into every one of his novels. The scenes included always end up having a purpose, something that some authors forget. I loved the rotation between characters. This is one of the beauties of his shorter but also well-written fantasy Elantris, and it is even more masterfully done here in The Way of Kings. Some authors dabble in this, but they don't truly master it as well as Sanderson. Some things that were a struggle: I got tired have having to keep track of the massive cast of characters, especially when I took breaks while reading the book. I struggled for a while to get into the book. There is just so much background that goes into understanding a book of this complexity. It made it tough for me to stay engaged. In all, if you are not prepared for a long book in a long series, this one isn't for you. You really have to be dedicated to understand the sheer beauty of the book. In all, I rate this book: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ PG-13 for violence","2020-05-15","United States","","true","94","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JTZBJK7NU3O5"

"B003P2WO5E","5","incredible","So many people recommended this series, and now I see why. This epic story had me in tears multiple times as I rooted for the triumph of my favorite characters. It made me laugh and it explored deep, complex and real philosophical questions about humanity. Marvelous. Stop deliberating and buy it now.","2025-02-19","United States","","true","96","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNX4TW30RFVPI"
"B003P2WO5E","5","This book rocks.","The hype is deserved. Can’t believe it took me this long to dive into the epic setting of Roshar. Really terrific writing, lots of great characters and moments. Try to stay away from spoilers if you can. Go into this book knowing as little as possible for the best experience. If you’re on the fence about checking Way of Kings out, just dive in. You won’t regret it. Can’t wait to read further into the series.","2025-01-12","United States","","true","97","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ITO5NYAOR41J"
"B003P2WO5E","5","Amazing book","The book itself is incredibly good, so much so that I’ve bought every other book in the series. The formatting of the book, however, is periodically shoddy. There’s numerous instances where words like ‘is’ and ‘that’ are either out of order, in the sentence, or not present at all. For example: ‘I have said I that cannot be’. That should be ‘I have said that I cannot be’. I understand that the book is massive but editing standards still need to be met.","2024-12-27","United States","","true","98","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1L7LP7WDWJY0N"
"B003P2WO5E","5","simply brilliant","What an awesome book! I loved every single, nearly every single page. For a book of fantasy this far surpasses literary works","2025-03-20","United States","","true","99","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PXQRONHW8C16"
"B003P2WO5E","5","The hype is real!!!","This is such a big book. It was so intimidating to get into and it was worth it. Brandon Sanderson is a master when it comes to world building the beginning of the storm light archives does a great job at setting the scene and getting to know the characters. This is an epic high fantasy that is worth the read the first five books are available in the series. I look forward to reading them all.","2025-01-07","United States","","true","100","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RURGFNP097QYN"
