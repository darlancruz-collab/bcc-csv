"B0CPWQZNQB","5","Oaths fulfilled, not broken","When I read The Way of Kings way back when it first came out, I remember a couple recurring thoughts popping up throughout the reading: ""Wow, I'm X% through a 1000+ pg book and I'm sad I only have Y more pages of this awesomeness"" and ""Holy crap this entire book is basically a prologue to something bigger."" Wind and Truth started slow. It felt like a soft lit reel of feel-good reflections by the main characters set to ""Time of Your Life"" by Green Day as they mournfully braced themselves for the epic final adventure. This bugged me more than most of my friends apparently. Me: ""Ugh this is Brandon's slowest start to a book EVER. We get it. People have grown and changed and there's a lot of feels and goodbyes because probably people are going to die and the rest of the book is going to be insane non-stop action."" Others: ""I mean it feels appropriate and I kind of like it..."" Me: [rolls eyes and looks elsewhere for commiseration] Given the context now of the, ahem, journey and destination, I'm allowing myself to feel the feels of those early chapters. Unsurprisingly for Sanderson, the master of sticking the landing, Wind and Truth delivers. In appropriate counterpoint to The Way of Kings, it feels like a 1000 page climax. That feeling that ultimately happens in a Sanderson book near the end where something VERY COOL happens alongside a surprising and satisfying conclusion? There were so many of those in this book starting around the halfway point. Taln on the pile of bodies and Ash's dying words... I almost jumped out of my chair. So much brilliant resolution of favorite character arcs (I'm left a bit breathless by Kaladin) - even the lingering unresolved tension in other arcs feels so very right (Shallan...). The significant criticisms are mostly true. Some of the writing felt slapdash. The book would have benefited from a powerful editor's red pen. There's a lot of telling rather than showing. There was some content new to Cosmere stories that made some readers uncomfortable (Rlain and Renarin's romance and the explicit ""revelation"" that some characters have sex). The mental health themes got a bit heavy-handed (Kaladin responding to Ishar ""I'm his therapist"" might be the low point of the whole series). And there wasn't as much resolution as many expected for the ""end"" of the five-book arc (I thought that was perfect, actually). Some of the criticisms are baseless contrarianism - as common as windspren when an author reaches a certain level of popularity. Stephen King writes great characters and sucks at endings. Patrick Rothfuss writes beautiful sentences but sucks at... actually writing. And for Sanderson, his prose isn't Dickens. But where he shines, he is brighter than Nightblood's self-perception. Sanderson uses the framework of fantasy to explore questions like ""what is truth?"" ""what is good?"" ""what is leadership?"" ""how do people grow?"" ""why is there suffering?"" and ""what do healthy boundaries look like?"" Rarely does he try and tell us what to think - even if a trusted character is coming to a conclusion, you can usually find someone else with a counterpoint or challenging a pithy answer with nuance. (A favorite exception in Wind and Truth is Wit's rant against the Thaylen Passions religion - a thinly veiled and fantastically vicious condemnation of health and wealth style religions.) This distinction is so important and addresses some of the gripes popping up in one star reviews. Is Sanderson ""pushing"" a worldview down his reader's throats? In my opinion, no. Do characters see particular worldviews as good and provide thoughtful reasons for them? Yes. It has always been that way in his books. Jasnah has been providing compelling reasons for atheism and Utilitarianism since The Way of Kings. Sazed argues for Universalism in Mistborn. Wayne (Mistborn Era 2) steals everything. I love Jasnah and Sazed and am not a Utilitarian or Universalist. I love Wayne and think his kleptomania is wrong. But I don't think I can believe in a thing if I can't provide compelling arguments for the opposing options. Part of why Sanderson's characters are so compelling is their willingness to think, argue, grow and change - just like us. What Dalinar was convinced was right and good changes as he learns and grows. Same with Szeth, Kaladin, Shallan, Navani, Adolin... you get the point. And the arcs are not necessarily linear - just like us they can be iterative and recursive. So to assume a character (or the author behind the pen) is telling you that their previously held beliefs are wrong because they've progressed to the next thing is an intellectual fallacy of progressive ideology (that Sanderson has already shown he does not fall for). Readers who are upset by Wind and Truth are reading fantasy for the wrong reasons. To be fair, the genre label is misleading. If you want saccharine thoughtless unchallenging escapism that fits and protects a narrow worldview, every flavor is available. But this is a series of books that is literally about people being challenged and growing. Seen for what it is, I think Wind and Truth is satisfying on a visceral ""well that was freaking awesome"" level as well as emotionally and intellectually. In my opinion, the people who don't like it haven't been paying close attention to the Cosmere books. No matter your opinions (and mine are high - it could be my favorite Cosmere novel to date), he has changed fantasy forever.","2025-02-05","United States","","true","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WCCMT4E2BQ5T"
"B0CPWQZNQB","5","Spectacularly ties most loose ends","I did not enjoy this as much as the best of the previous ones. This book is full of exposition, the amount of backstory we got feels like it doubles what we had been given for all the series so far! It’s amazing however that the outcome was not predictable at all and that we got pretty good answers. So, this part of the story focused on understanding Roshar history and crafting a satisfying finale. While these goals might seem weak, most writers fail to deliver a proper ending or to fill the gaps in their stories. They build expectations, sheltered behind obscurity and when the time comes to drop the curtain, there hardly anything to show. Well, Sanderson does a pretty good job at that. Our protagonists all have their moments and progress. If you have read more of Sanderson’s works you know what kind of ending to expect and yes, this feels like an ending, though there is a lot left untold. But yeah the scope of this story was so huge that not everything could be tied cleanly. Without going into spoilers I will say that the pacing is slow. You know all will happen at the last 15% but you don’t feel that the first 85% is not worthy. I wanted to read this book in 1-2 days, though it was too large so it took me like 4-5. I could hardly stop reading. There is emotion - not as strong as in some previous books, but enough to leave you in tears at times. Mainly that’s why I gave the 5th star. If you reached this book I doubt you will skip it no matter what I write. If you do care, I will say that this whole journey (as journeys are often mentioned in the series) has been a precious experience for me - maybe my best book series. The ending is a bit more chaotic that Mistborn 1, but I will hold the 2 intros of the way of the kings in my heart until I die. I must also add that if you are facing depression this series will probably help!

"B0CPWQZNQB","5","Long awaited, long in form, unique in my reading experience.","I have never read anything like Wind and Truth. It is not perfect. For one, it is LONG. There are sections that I almost want to rush past. The buffeting back and forth between characters, settings, and timelines is disorienting and at times frustrating. In the end though, the story is so fresh, so different, and so satisfying that I am a bit sad I am done with it. I love some of these characters. I am all over the place with my reactions… it is hard to accept that some of the ultimate threads are still not fully resolved. The tale is one of growth and I like that. I eagerly await the second Arc, whenever that comes.","2025-02-16","United States","","true","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Y8BY50DRR76E"
"B0CPWQZNQB","4","Do the Winds carry the answers needed?...","Well, what a rollercoaster of a book this was for me! Wind and Truth from the one and only Brandon Sanderson, long awaited and highly anticipated book 5 in the massively popular Stormlight Archive series has landed and made its mark on us all...good and bad it seems so far. The conclusion to the first half of the Saga, in what will be a 10 book epic has us looking at a loooong wait to continue where book 5 leaves us, on the edge of a massive cliff, looking at a aggressive storm front... with more questions than ever before! 🥴 With that said however, this massive volume is chock full of that next level world building, character depth, insanely deep lore and breath stealing twists and betrayals that we have come to expect and crave from Sanderson and his unparalleled skill with the pen. The unique magic system introduced in this world continues to impress and shock me, even 5 massive books in. Just when you think you've got the next couple steps figured out, you are knocked into another realm with no idea what just happened or how to navigate what is to come. Brilliant story arc weaving creates a beautifully woven blanket of PoV's that wrap us readers in a cocoon of trials, transformation and sacrifice that seem to demand so much attention, you can't help but to lose most of your day in this shattered landscape. Written in what was just a brilliant idea to structure a story, we are following our characters through a 10 day lead up to a chaotic and emotional final confrontation. The fate of Roshar is teetering on the edge of destruction...can the Winds of Truth usher in the answer needed to prevail?! During these ever expanding different paths our characters take us through is where I found my one and only issue (which I briefly saw in earlier books in this series) and that is, I felt at times, this book could have maybe been trimmed by about 300 or so pages. Perhaps just me, but the many PoV's all seemed to have quite a bit of (imo) too much unwarranted context that wasn't truly necessary to progress the story? Seemed like content fluff to pad the book size ..and good God why would we need that!! 😋 I at points started to ask myself if this was going to be the entry I might not resonate with and find disappointment...yea, there's the ""rollercoaster"" part of the review, boy did it prove NOT to be! The last quarter of the book grabbed me like a lashing and yanked my devotion and love of this world back on track! 🔥 The ending is the other part of the earlier mentioned start of the review ...more questions. I guess I had my own ideas as to how this would wrap up by the end of this entry...but man, things just seemed to blow open and leave us scrambling to grab a hold of everything that happened and ""try"" to piece it together! 🤯 Pacing at points and what is not a definitive conclusion by any stretch, should absolutely NOT deter you or your love of this Saga. As I stated, the level of story telling, character depth, world building and creativity from Sanderson will guide you through this all, and present you with a work of art that will continue to dazzle and change every time you look at it or discuss in forms for years to come. Thank God for this...as we are now looking at years before we continue our journey through the Cosmere. So break out your deck of cards and get your skill at Towers trained up...the battle will continue, will you be ready?! 💪 4⭐ and man was that hard for me ...these are usually 5⭐ but between the ""at times"" bloated chapters, jaw dropping (but wide open) ending and the years till our answers, I landed on a rock solid 4 almost 4.5. Each journey is it's own...what will yours bring you? Enjoy my fellow Cosmere fans, this is far from over! 🔥🍻","2025-02-23","United States","","true","4","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KEL2A45ARO2X"
"B0CPWQZNQB","5","Masterpiece","Masterpiece. This is one of the most creative and talented authors I've ever read. Every bit as good as Tolkien and George R R Martin in his ability to develop dynamic characters and rich lore. This is my favorite series since A Song of Ice and Fire. You realize that Sanderson has had this entire series in his head - in all its glorious and voluminous depth - since the beginning of book one. Amazing. He creates characters you really connect with while seamlessly factoring in complex topics like mental health, spirituality/religion, human relations, and so much more. I'm truly grateful for this series - it is a gift - and could not recommend it strongly enough to fans of fantasy fiction.","2025-03-23","United States","","true","5","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLU4FUS4TO08D"
"B0CPWQZNQB","5","And brilliant ending of an arc that only Brandon Sanderson could write","First, for some of the key plot elements of this book to make sense you must at least finish the original mistborn trilogy. Understanding Cosmere is relevant for understanding this book. That aside, Brandon Sanderson has done it again. Treating almost all of his major characters with humanity and depth that makes you unable to resist rooting for them. I've never read epic fantasy that was actually good for my mental health, but that's how kindly and compassionately he treats the characters dealing with problems both on a cosmic scale but also the same ones we face every day. The pacing of this book was excellent, the narrative arcs satisfying for the characters you care about, and the ending something you would have never predicted...one that leaves you happy, sad, and eagerly anticipating the conclusion of the entire series. The primary questions that the series asks in book one are answered and divine characters are revealed to be surprisingly human and flawed. This book does this while opening up new questions and forcing the reader to beg the question, ""how is this going to play out"". The stormlight archive for me personally is cemented on my Mount Rushmore of favorite fiction series, and you should read this and the whole series if you love epic fantasy, swords, powers, heroes you can root for and villains you loathe, world building, and mystery. Must read. Epic conclusion","2025-02-23","United States","","true","6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R390A8LFS1B7O8"
"B0CPWQZNQB","5","This is the best Sanderson YET!","I'm a huge reader, Probably 2-3 books a week. Sanderson, admittedly, is one of my favorite authors due to his unique writing style and worlds. This book blows anything away that he's written in my opinion! There are 3 main point of views you follow through this book and they change up pretty darn often which keeps the pace moving pretty quick. I remember seeing that I was only 20% of the way through the book and I couldn't believe how hooked I was and how much was happening already. Brandon has a way of being a little sloggish in the Stormlight Series... NOT in this book. The pacing is perfect. There is a lot of introspect in this book. A lot of self discovery, but it's not boring - it's tied together with constant happenings. None of it feels forced and some of it is a bit surprising. You have to actually think about the whole book to even realize it's surprising because of how well it's done. You will see some people completely different at the end of this book. One in particular, in my opinion. I laughed out loud plenty of times. I sat on the edge of my seat plenty of times. I thought I had it all figured out plenty of times (I was right about a couple of things throughout the book). In typical BS fashion Brandon tosses ya a few things that are almost impossible to feel out even though he does foreshadow here and there. You have to realize he loves a fake foreshadowing as well though. Overall, this is my favorite book I've read of his. It brought so much together, elightened quite a bit, and really has me wondering what's happening next. VERY hard to try to figure out. But I CANNOT wait to see. One note: As usual, you don't need to read the rest of the cosmere books for this, but oh boy if you do it's a lot more fun (at least I think it would be since I have). No matter what, get this book!","2024-12-10","United States","","true","7","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RO3B2MFQC0N2W"

"B0CPWQZNQB","2","A Monumental Failure | Not really invested| YA Style | Quality Nosedive","Has Stormlight shifted toward more of a Young Adult style, losing some of the depth and internal consistency of the previous books? I find it genuinely difficult to understand how readers who enjoyed the first four books might find this one equally satisfying. Many dedicated Sanderson fans I know have expressed disappointment with this latest installment, and personally, it diminished my enthusiasm for the Cosmere overall. If I'm being very gracious, I would appreciate the fact that at least Brandon Sanderson’s sense of moral depth still shines through—he clearly cares about weaving meaningful lessons into his stories. But man, Wind and Truth was a huge letdown for me. It starts off with some promising ideas, a powerful preface, and a good sense of epicness, but the actual reading experience felt rough, choppy, and far less engaging than past Stormlight entries. Significantly so. What Happened? Rushed editing schedules and the looming Dragonsteel convention supposedly ""forced"" an early release—by at least a year, maybe even two. But I just think Brandon is coasting on his success and becoming too enraptured with the freedom of being able to write whatever he wants and is simply not listening enough to feedback. That’s his choice, but it's the same reason so many things fail after success, and it seems to be a major misstep. Yes, there are pockets of good stuff, but overall it reads like a draft that needed much more polishing. I honestly have no idea how this ever got published. Strengths Strong Morals and Ethics Sanderson stays true to his habit of infusing genuinely good lessons into his work. You can see his thoughtfulness and heart, which is nice in a fantasy world that often gets stuck in endless battles and drama with horribly immoral characters everywhere. You get noblebright with Sanderson, and I like that. Ambitious Ideas There’s no shortage of grand plans in the high-level plot, character arcs, and Cosmere connections. Some truly bold twists show what Sanderson show that he can risk big things in a book. Unfortunately, so many of them fell flat due to horrible execution and writing that was cringeworthy sometimes. Emotional Moments There are still a few heart-wrenching scenes that show off his usual talent for big, stirring climaxes. Unfortunately, they don’t pop up often enough to carry the entire novel because everything changes so much. He blames expanding scope of world, but this is still an excuse. It is extremely clear he didn't need to write as much as he did to almost everyone except him. Main Criticisms Uneven Execution This is the major problem. Maybe he could have pulled it off. But the editing was horrendous. The structural ideas are interesting, but the actual prose and scene-to-scene flow never really come together. It feels more like a decently revised draft than the polished novel we usually expect. Excessive Length and Bloating It's not how big the book is... 1,330 pages could have been done well, but the story drags in the middle (roughly pages 700–900). This would have been fine but so much of it felt completely unnecessary, or were obviously just soapboxes for Sanderson to info dump and share his beliefs. Spending more time with the central plot and characters would have enhanced this book dramatically. Overuse of POV Shifts We bounce between characters almost every few pages, which leads to constant narrative whiplash. I can't express how much this completely kills the moments that should have been impactful. This is so obvious and almost everyone is complaining about it. It is not possible that Sanderson didn't realize this feedback, he just ignored it. Awkward Withholding of Information A lot of scenes cut off right when something major is about to happen, sentences don't finish, and other super cheap devices to create tension are so overused in this book. This is such a stark contrast to the masterful way Sanderson fulfilled promises in previous installments. It feels like a gimmick rather than genuine tension. After it happens enough times, those “big reveals” just don’t hit as hard. A Shoehorned Plot The whole book feels like every single plot point is too artificial and shoehorned in to some idea Sanderson had for where it should go instead of actually considering whether things truly worked or not. Previous books felt so much more organic and real, and this felt completely artificial and synthetic. Like I was ""seeing through"" the novel the entire time and never getting pulled in. Inconsistent Tone and Style Every now and then, random modern phrases pop up on Roshar, which is jarring and completely ridiculous. Cringeworthy phrases abound in this book, and my eyes could not stop rolling at the utter stupidity of some of the things characters say. No one on Roshar ever said to be ""the adult in the room"" or cursed with Earth terms or got hot and heavy in certain scenes. This is inconceivable and ridiculous that someone as skilled as Sanderson doesn't understand how bad that is to do. I don't care how you rationalize it. It's bad dude. No one likes it. They're just telling you what you want to hear. Limited Character Growth After so many pages spent with these people, I was hoping for deeper development. Szeth is our main character, and things started out so interesting with him, but his path was SO repetitive and boring after a while that something that could have been amazing just fell completely flat. Most characters just rehash old lessons or add a thin layer of a new lesson on topic of that. Characters and plot were usually deeply tied together, and this time, it just didn't work. Editing Shortcomings It’s surprising that a large group of early readers didn't scream at Sanderson to stop what he was doing with the rough pacing, repetitive themes, clichés, and other tone issues. This could have been a masterpiece. There's no excuse for releasing it early. Reading Experience Flow and Pacing I found myself taking a lot of breaks to slog through the sluggish middle portion, battling frustration almost every chapter. There are cool reveals, but we don't get to savor any of them because the POV shifts are way too much in this book.. Emotional Exhaustion and Frustration with The Book Steal The Good Moments Some folks might still enjoy the big reveals and the overarching Cosmere connections. I, however, felt worn down by the uneven pace and frequently puzzled by certain narrative choices. Sanderlanche was less than hoped for Yes, the final act does ramp up. But with so many perspective shifts piled on top of the rest of the book’s problems, it felt more chaotic than thrilling. The ending was okay, not the jaw-dropper I’d hoped for. So many things were just dropped or ended quicker than I felt they ought to have. It Ruined The Cosmere For Me I no longer really care what happens in the Cosmere with any emotional investment. This was the biggest let down of the year and the worst book I read in 2024. His writing is becoming increasingly predictable, juvenile, and unpolished. I thought this was going to be the best series ever written, this book made it clear that it won't be by a long shot. Conclusion As someone who used to be totally on board with Stormlight, this left me bummed out and honestly ready for a break from Sanderson. I’ll likely keep reading his stuff—especially the graphic audio editions I enjoy more—but my excitement for the series took a major hit. Some readers might still find things to like, but for me, it was a draining read that fell short of what I’ve come to expect.","2024-12-22","United States","","true","9","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RZEVXPDSO395"

I think this is the longest book in the series thus far, and I think it could have used another round of editing to cut it down some more. There were certain parts that just dragged on for too long. It's an okay conclusion to the five part story arc but of course there is much more to come, since this is supposed to be ten books.

I like that Syl tried to help Kaladin feel better. I like that in some of the chapters in this novel Kaladin practiced playing his flute and became better at playing that flute. I like the chapters that take place while Dalinar, Navani, Shallan, Renarin, and Rlain were in the Spiritual Realm. I don’t like that Shallan lied in Chapter Five in this novel.

I don’t like that King Gavilar lowered Navani’s confidence. I don’t like that Sozen committed suicide in front of Szeth. I don’t like that in this novel Taravangian and Nale thought that the moral thing and the right thing to do were different. Taravangian and Nale were wrong: the moral thing and the right thing are the same. I don’t like that some of the Skybreakers were with some of the Parshendi when they fought people on Narak. I don’t like that in this novel Moash murdered two of the Windrunners. I don’t like that one of the Shin honorbearers lied when he said “the Voidbringers won’t return.” Eighteen of the sentences in this novel aren’t grammatically correct. One of the questions in this novel isn’t grammatically correct. I don't like that the author described Shallan as an adult in this novel because she wasn't an adult then. Shallan wasn't an adult then because her brain wasn't developed then. Her brain was going to finish developing several years after the epilogue in in this novel when she was twenty-three. In this novel Shallan was nineteen. I don’t like that the author described Neturo (Szeth’s father) as bald and had hair on the sides of his head. Clearly Neturo wasn’t bald then. The author misspelled two words in one of the sentences Lift said when she talked to Gavinor in this novel. Brandon Sanderson needs to type sentences that are grammatically correct, avoid misspelling a word, and avoid typing a question that isn’t grammatically correct in the sixth novel in The Stormlight Archive.

"B0CPWQZNQB","4","Halfway through seems so far","I had many mixed feelings about this book. As much as I love the Storm light Archives, I feel like this book gave me too much to digest. I don't want to say I'm afraid of large books, but getting my hardcopy in the mail, set the tone for me and finding out at the end of the book this is the halfway point of the archive gave me shudders of exhaustion and disappointment. I was ready to put this story to bed and focus on how this story plays out in the Greater Cosmere. Nope. Not yet. Don't get me wrong, the story is amazing. We still get character growth, struggles, and many resolutions. However, I felt this book was like the title of the Michelle Yeoh movie, Everything Everywhere All at Once. Chapters were long and hopped from character story to character story and as soon as I'd settle in with a part of the story, we were off to someone else who either I wasn't invested in as much or the actual story wasn't invested in as much. Action by Sanderson was awesome as always. You will not hunger from lack of battle external or internal. No one does introspection better than Sanderson in my opinion. His characters tend to make me feel better than most. He is meticulous when it comes to battles as his words leap off the page and perform in front of you. His use of tempo of the text aid as you are trapped reading (and listening) the events. It is mindblowing. My main issue with this book, is it's just exhausting. It's good, but after every reading session, I was mentally tired. The next time I went to open my Kindle, the hardcore, or pop into Audible, my heart said yay, but my soul was like ""can we just stop and listen to our favorite songs or read a short story or novelle for a bit?"" It lead me to serious guilt and I couldn't get through this book as fast as the last four. If anything, I take off a star for the story because the level of fatigue I got during this book. Hate me if you like, but as heavy as concepts of this book, it felt a little like reading War and Peace. I would have preferred this book broken in half. If you made it this far, thanks! Here's my spoiler. Totally worth the struggle for Kalodin. Journey before Destination.","2025-01-03","United States","","true","21","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OKO5A6V7XRHB"
"B0CPWQZNQB","3","Didn't enjoy surprisingly","I have loved the Stormlight Series and the cast of diverse characters, a seemingly endless magic system and ties to other stories in a vast cosmere. I have been very excited for this last book and although I still finished it quickly and its a must-read if you've already committed to the series, I honestly found this to be my least favorite book in the series. Sanderson is a great writer and I have loved the moral and theological questions posed in the series as characters struggle to sort out their personal belief systems with their life experiences. The tension with the tug and pull of these has been a beautiful part of the series for me as the action reinforces and brings to life the importance of figuring out your own answers. This particular book however feels very...overt? Less nuanced? Boring? Where all the other books felt like real explorations of big questions, this book felt like a hammer to the head. In trying to give the story closure and deep background, it felt like there was a lot of expository filler and repetition in a way I don't think he's done before and that I didn't enjoy. That said I thought the conclusion was creative and not predictable, but I don't think I would read more of the series. Maybe its just time to find a new series. Although I will miss my favorite characters, there just isn't enough to keep me engaged with them anymore and wished I'd just stopped reading at the previous book.","2025-06-23","United States","","true","22","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EMON545FMISF"

"B0CPWQZNQB","5","Finally! It Was Worth the Wait for Fans","So, when one speaks/writes of Brandon Sanderson, it is known he is a prolific writer. He has so many books and short stories, etc! But they all hold this thread which connects them all to the same universe. Fans understand this very well. So that is one feature that makes him stand out. I’ve been a fan for so long I actually cannot pinpoint my first time date-wise. But I do know it was strangely enough his first novel of the “Cosmere”. That story remains one of my favorites out of all his stories. Then one Stormlight Archive. When I see a thick book of MANY, MANY pages, I simply cannot wait to attack it & go on the journey that is within. I have done a re-read of the entire Stormlight Archives which I had to do so I could have a fresh understanding of everything within these book & so that I would be ready for this novel. And let me tell you it was very much worth it! I waited so long for this book that I had forgotten when the presumed release would be. So when I saw that it was actually being ready for publication by a specific date , I had to buy the Amazon pre-purchase deal. So that very day they said it was to be delivered I waited for that package until it was in my hands. Yeah, I have total geek tendencies & they are at their peak during times such as these. Well, it is one of his largest books he’s ever written & it’s taken me done time because I don’t speed read, I digest as I read so I can enjoy. That’s is what I did with this book. I was there with every character at every turn & it was great! So now I will go on to the next release because this is only the first arc end of the Stormlight Archive.","2024-12-28","United States","","true","28","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R108GMLN8HDQAH"

"B0CPWQZNQB","4","""The Wind and Truth"" is solid but doesn’t quite soar","Brandon Sanderson’s signature strength is taking us on deep, transformative journeys with his characters. This book leans heavily into that—maybe too heavily. Some of the self-realization arcs felt drawn out, and honestly, trimming about 200 pages wouldn’t have hurt. That said, one character who absolutely shines here is Adolin. He’s someone I’ve loved from the very beginning, and it was so satisfying to see him finally get his due in this book. Sanderson really gave him the spotlight, and it added a much-needed spark to the story. As for the ending? Well... it left me a little conflicted. It felt more ethereal, more high-concept than I was hoping for. After trekking through such a long and grueling journey with these characters, I wanted a strong emotional gut-punch to cap it all off. That said, I get why Sanderson chose this ending. It’s not the end of Roshar’s story—far from it. We’re at the start of a new arc, and this was more of a bridge than a conclusion. But still! I craved a little more oomph to close this chapter. Even with those quibbles, I have to say—I simply love Sanderson’s writing. The phrase “Journey before Destination” comes up a lot in this series, and it really resonates with me. Whatever bumps there might be along the way, Sanderson has created a world and characters that are pure brilliance. I’m glad to be on this journey with them—and I’ll definitely be back for the next one!","2025-01-23","United States","","true","31","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKUUHK006NWRN"

Sanderson is one of the few authors who elicits audible reactions from me, and this book continued that trend. There are so many great moments in this book that I wish I could relive for the first time. The characters continue to be well done, and the pacing of this book was well-done to me due to the structure of the final 10 days. Sanderson neatly wraps up a lot of loose ends but leaves a big enough cliffhanger that I’m already craving book 6 and am sad I’ll have to wait so many years to interact with new Stormlight Acrhive material!","2025-05-05","United States","","true","34","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3A1UUPS6134J9"

There is no debate that this is one of the greatest high fantasy series ever written, and thus is 5/5 stars. My three star review is not of the author and story, it is of the physical product itself (the book). Beautiful cover art and nice weight. HOWEVER, the pages are made from super cheap, thin, WHITE, printer paper. I was severely disappointed in this, I expected higher quality from TOR fantasy, especially considering the price of the book. You can see the difference in my picture. The left book is Winds and Truth and the right one is Towers of Midnight, from 2010. The difference is significant. The pages in the older TOR fantasy book are thicker, creamier, and have a much nicer luxury feel.

When I get overwhelmed, I write out the first three oaths. Now, some of the follow up books have been underwhelming, but I read them anyway. I would say this book is better than or equal to the previous three books, but not as good as the first. All in all, I am happy to own it. One thing I did do is read the book more slowly this time. I devoured the first book. I read it in a dark, difficult time, and it genuinely helped get me through it. The next few books were paced more slowly. I felt less connected to the characters, with the exception of Lyft. I adore Lyft. Kaladin plays a minor role in this book. I give that as a fair warning because he is my favorite character. Lyft also plays a minor role, but hopefully she will develop into a larger one (if you have not read Edgedancer, buy it now).","2025-02-23","United States","","true","41","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39ZY5958RCCL2"

I love most of his material, with a few exceptions for quirks in his writing style. But then, ALL writers have quirks! I am only giving 4 stars, due to the quality of the materials, in almost ALL of his books that I have purchased, including THIS book. The covers, spines, and binding, in general, are lower quality. The covers LOVE to bend BACKWARDS in a curve. The spines pull free and/or break. Both of these are caused by cheap book-binding. I believe that his EPIC sized books, being so thick and heavy, are the most susceptible to this. I returned the first copy I received of this book, due to this very kind of damage.

"B0CPWQZNQB","2","What was that? Did Brandon even write this?","I've been waiting for this book for how long? So eager! Anticipation spren all around me! Excited beyond words! It's finally here! Oh boy I'm so Ready!!! FOR: Disappointment. I feel robbed and cheated. This was 1300 pages of a review of the first 4 books while trying to set you up for the next 5 books with just a big disappointment for an ending. Did he forget the action? Where are the heroes? He didn't include the cosmere in the first four books, then changes his mind and shovels it all in the fifth? What? Kal is a Shardbearer ..... But now he's a really bad therapist? Wow. Not for me. I thought Dalinar asked him to be King? Shouldn't there have been closure about the unmade spren with Rlain/Renarin? Shallan's story was just a very long, boring epilogue that should have been at the end of book 4... Adolin... It's should have been spectacular. We've been waiting for what happens with him and Maya since the first book.... This kind of felt like a epilogue too... Maya kept saying she would save them... She didn't ever get there tho... When she did, it was just so-so .... So what Five book series. Then five more. Ok. The first book has its own arc while connecting to the overall five/ten book arc. Yay perfect! 2nd book also Yay!!! Books 3 & 4, yes. All 4 books had their separate story that has a beginning, climax, and end while still connecting to the overall cosmere story with Easter eggs. I greatly enjoyed those! Book 5 didn't have its own story arc.... Did we have heroes that save everyone at the end in miraculous ways after their Ascension to their last and most important Ideal!!!! (The ideal that most radiants are unable to ever achieve!-- thats how special it is!) Nope.... nothing happens like that. No twist, no surprises, no miraculous duels to win the war, Not one special or exciting thing happened in this book at all.... Parts that you thought were going to be special (Adolin & Maya, Seth & Kal), were just a let down... So bad that I said out loud on several different occasions....""that's it?""... ""How can that be it?""..... 1300 pages of just a downward slope of failure for every one of your most favorite characters..... The whole time you're holding hope in your heart for a Brandon save at the end that leaves you wanting to read the whole book again!! Nope! Not happening. All you get is: Everyone failed THE END! Aren't you excited for the next 5 books??? Ummm no. I'm not.. I may not ever buy them at all... This has to have been the worst ending to a book series that I've ever read. I might have to get off the Brandon boat here. I'm not going to waste my money and read 1300 pages to just be sad that everyone failed and died. I don't read to be bored and unhappy at the end..... I read to enjoy getting away from the real world and enjoy fantasy happiness.... This feels like 1300 pages of not caring about the end of this story line because he's too busy tryin to set you up for the next 5 books. The setup for the next 5 books shouldn't be the whole last book of of the first 5. The setup for the next five should have been a epilogue at the end... NOT the entire book 5. We deserved to have a conclusion to all the effort these characters put in through out the first 4 books. NOT. It was all a waste of time they shouldn't have bothered even trying. Just let Odium have it all at the beginning and don't bother with the journey because it meant nothing at the end. It was a big waste of time and effort... Not a fan. Very upset. Disappointed to the point of feeling cheated by Brandon for taking my money in exchange for this trash. Will I recommend this series..... I don't think I can in good conscience.... He needs to take this book and redo it like he did the original Stormlight....","2025-01-06","United States","","true","43","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EHZJ9M4JUGDY"
"B0CPWQZNQB","4","Superb world and story, but…","I’m done with Stormlight until he's totally completed it. The books are way too long and he's taking way too much time in between them. I can't possibly remember all of it and no story - no matter how good, and make no mistake, this story is GOOD - is worth having to keep rereading or relistening to over and over again to jog the memory, and especially not one that will require investing hundreds of hours when I can be reading and listening to so many other things. Not worth it. Not even remotely. If it takes him 20 more years to finish it (and it might), I'll probably have forgotten so much that when I do get back to it, it'll be like experiencing it for the first time again. I would compare it to traveling: repeatedly going back and rereading Stormlight over and over again when I can be experiencing other stories would be like forking out huge sums of money and time to revisit the same place when I could use that money and time to see other parts of the world.","2025-01-09","United States","","true","44","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDT6XVP5PGS6N"

"B0CPWQZNQB","3","A little sad and unfulfilled","I just want to start out by saying, I love Brandon Sanderson and have unabashedly raved about him since the early 2000's. I believe I've read about 90% of all his works, and in the case of the Stormlight Archive, I enjoyed multiple re-reads for the first 4 books in the series. Sadly, Book 5 is, by far, my least favorite. If I had to distill it down to one concise aspect, I'd say this: His characters are no longer allowed to ""win"" -- everything is now a pyrrhic victory (at best). One of the things I love about Brandon's writing style is that he seems to have everything mapped out so thoroughly and strategically -- but at the same time, he maintained the visceral excitement about what was happening in that moment. Kaladin jumping across the chasm, against all odds in Book 1 brought tears to my eyes. Kaladin jumping into the arena to stand with Adolin against overwhelming odds in Book 2 made me cheer out loud. Etc, etc. The problem with Book 5, is that every decision made by the main characters is immediately buzzkilled by informing the audience that the consequences are probably going to be way worse. Again and again. I never once got emotionally charged by the characters in this book. Honestly, I rather felt like Sanderson was trying to channel ""Game of Thrones"" fatalism into his writing style -- which has _never_ been a draw for me. I'm a little sad and unfulfilled after reading this book.","2025-05-04","United States","","true","46","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU3R9QFTUPDN7"

Even though I have read every Sanderson book and loved every minute, I had my doubts about how he would wrap up the first arc in such an exceptional series. I had doubts that characters would get their happy or deserved endings. The first four books set up so many emotions and plotlines for so many characters and I did not believe it was possible to be satisfied on all fronts. Believe me when I tell you that this book managed to deliver everything masterfully. The perfect mix of tragedy and happy endings has left me speechless. Every single page delivered new twists that were as unexpected but somehow made me feel like there was no other possible outcome. The antithetic array of emotions I have from the finale is going to keep me up all night. I am distraught that we will have to wait so long for the continuation of this amazing world but, that is all part of the journey.

"B0CPWQZNQB","2","Product of its time","Extremely disappointing. I have read the first four books (and both novellas) multiple times. I read through them again in preparation for reading book five. I love them. I recommended to my two teenage sons that they read them along with me and we could all read book five together. I regret this. Up until this point Sanderson has been very squeamish about putting ""romance"" in his books. He's not good at writing it, it is awkward and makes him uncomfortable, and it isn't why we are here anyways. He was squeamish about it until now. But he’s still not good at it, it’s awkward and uncomfortable, and it for sure isn’t why we’re here. It isn't super in your face, but it's there. Shallan and Adolin take a shower together, embrace, and cut to Shallan laying on the floor of the shower watching Adolin get dressed. Two male characters spend the entire book struggling with homosexual feelings, accepting them, and then acting on them which culminates in a kissing scene between them. This for me cheapened the bond and relationship between them. It could have been an amazing and intimate friendship, akin to Gimli and Legolas. Bridging worlds. Instead it just felt middle-school immature/cheap. Other than that, there's just some boring stuff, which basically comes down to there being so many people that spend so much of the book just whining about their trauma and inadequacies and things that happened to them. At one point I was just like, ""is everyone just deciding their a victim here???"" And finally there's some really obnoxious scenes where Sanderson makes some people the viewpoint character and repeatedly bludgeons you over the head with their neuro-divergence. There's no showing here, it's all telling, and thus (and I can't believe I'm saying this) bad writing. This book truly feels like a product of its time. Written just after the pandemic, middle of the trans-craze, early 2020's when everyone was deciding they were autistic or trans or traumatized or somehow or other neuro-divergent or non-CIS, and maybe all 5, and Sanderson just went ham on trying to be inclusive and cram as much of that in this book as he possibly could. There were several times when I looked up and wondered allowed, ""did he have a ghost-writer to a bunch of this? Like, what is going on???"" Don't just assume that because it is Sanderson it is safe for your kids (used to be a fairly good assumption). Some spoilers ahead... As for the story/conclusion of the arc? I didn't like it. Everyone just basically went, ""oh, we were wrong the whole time. Honor kinda sucks, and oaths are stupid, and everything we've been working towards was kinda bad."" He didn't end it so much as did a huge pivot, and I felt like I was watching a TV series that instead of giving a good respectful satisfying ending to my favorite characters, they killed off all the ones that wouldn't sign on for their new spin-off show that comes out next year and put all the focus on setting everything up for that show, thus making this entire show a glorified prologue. I've read the first four books multiple multiple times. This does not feel like the ending Sanderson set out to write. I wish if he'd changed his mind he'd just abandoned this series and gone and done something different. Book five ruins it. It's like I read an entire epic fantasy novel set in the Wild West of the US and at the end the US goes, ""oh no! We're accidentally evil!"" and then either kills themselves or gets back in boats and goes back to Europe or something, but they've already killed all the leaders and completely ruined all the land and so the Indians get stuck in a horrible desolate wasteland with no chiefs, and no actual society or culture and the only people with an actual culture or infrastructure/government just left.

"B0CPWQZNQB","3","No longer sure the destination is worth the journey.","Certainly, Sanderson is one of the best writers working when it comes to the ability to craft a character that readers care about. His books are full of them, and their interactions are the best part of any Sanderson novel. That said, there comes a point when the reader gets worn out with the incessant nature of their flaws. The fact that every single one of them is nearly paralyzed with worry and uncertainty. That all they seem to focus on is introspection. That those flaws are the entire point of their existence. That another 100 pages of them dealing with those flaws finally becomes boring.. When it’s not just the characters themselves that really need a therapist. And yes, in this novel Sanderson has to take a warrior character and literally turn him into a therapist. As in the word “therapist” is actually used to describe his function. Ugh. When your characters are beginning to prove that yes, in fact, broken people can become tedious, you might start to wonder about having jumped the shark. The Cosmere itself is a huge project that sounds like an interesting grand narrative, but I think Sanderson is finding its risks here. This novel, like the entire SA, this is a long, dark, melancholy story that ends, as far as we can really see, in an end of many of the most interesting aspects of Roshar. Yes, we can see Sanderson advanced the grand Cosmere story, but we don’t really have much investment in that one. It’s too vague. Too long. So large that we can’t even see that there IS a destination for certain. So why take the journey? The other worlds are too separated by time and distance. We can’t keep track of the characters read years ago in previous novels, and Hoid, the thread meant to keep them all woven together, is inadequate to the task as a character. Aside from some great dialogue…. Just another periphery character with secrets. Well, secrets usually don’t age too well, after a while people just move on and stop caring about them. People have to feel like they’re even ON a journey or all they really care about is where they ARE at the moment, and that means the book they’re reading has to move them along. This book, sadly, leaves the reader having slogged through pages and pages off molasses only to find a destination as monochromatic as storm clouds.","2024-12-24","United States","","true","52","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VHWXTS0WKPYW"

Every character in the story is busy becoming a kinder gentler version of themselves. The characters are constantly monologuing their emotional journeys in a way that's not authentic and robs them of interest as individual characters. It feels like a young adult novel. Sanderson wants to impart all the wisdom of the universe, but is he qualified to do so? The pacing is bad. This book is a marathon.

"B0CPWQZNQB","3","Uncharacteristically slow, bordering on boring, with no tangible stakes or investment...","I won't lie, it's hard for me to write a somewhat negative review for Brandon Sanderson - far and away my favorite author. I always wait with bated breath for his next release, and have written everything he's published. This has become a bit of a let down. It's moving at such a slow, plodding pace is one thing - not a deal breaker, but not the normal 'something-is-always-happening' cadence of a Sanderson book. I get that this is a huge book and meant to be of a different pace and flavor... But there is SO much time spent flashing back to ""replay"" the experiences of characters we barely know and definitely don't care about, that I find myself simply not caring at all what's going on. I get that there's some mystery waiting to be unlocked, but I have NOT enjoyed spending half the book in flash-backs, flash-sideways, flash-upside-downs in other bodies and ""things that already happened"" (which means there is no threat or stake for the characters, as we already know how things eventually turn out in the ""future"" of the observers who are recording these visions). There simply aren't stakes enough or enough investment in the huge number of characters being ""observed"" in visions for us to really care. Even though ""the fate of the world"" may depend on what Dalinar discovers in the visions, it's just too abstract a 'threat' to keep you sitting on the edge of your seat - or even really caring. I miss the ""page turning"" engagement I'm used to with Brandon's other books - even the much longer ones. I hope this is a one-book divergence. Brandon, I love your writing...

As a HUGE Brandon Sanderson fan, who has recommended the Cosmere to a plethora of family and friends, I'm disappointed in Wind & Truth. We've gone through the depression arcs with the characters in the previous books. It seems that every character has the requirement to be self-loathing and insecure to make it in Stormlight.. This track plays on repeat.. Besides the above, I had hopes that B.S. would take from his writing of the Wax & Wayne series and bring a tight storyline to Wind & Truth. However, many chapters felt slow and full of bloat. Honestly, it was unnecessarily long. I won't spoil any aspects of the characters and stories themselves, as this can be up to each individuals opinion on how he wrapped up this time period. Personally, I wanted more. I will continue reading the Cosmere as I'm very invested, but felt like Sanderson lost his way here.

"B0CPWQZNQB","2","RUINED. Hopefully not forever.","Man, I love Sanderson. Mistborn was awesome. Both parts. The first two Stormlight books were phenomenal. Third was mid. Fourth mid. This book. Sub mid. At best. My parents loved Tolkien. That was my gateway into fantasy. I can re-read The Hobbit, or LotR every few years and be like, ""yeah, that was a great story with relatable characters. Bravo."" My kids like those books too. TIMELESS. They are timeless. Mistborn and the first two Stormlight books were all of that on steroids. The characters were all so good but also so deliciously flawed. That one tiny thorn in the flesh. Characters like Kelsier who I still can't decide my feelings on. Villain? Every man hero? Well. Probably going to be the leader of a Marxist uprising in the next book ;( Mr. Sanderson took a DEI class and everything fell apart. Literally 90% of the characters are now on the DEI bingo sheet. I get it, fantasy readers are a troubled and nerdy lot. ME TOO! A lot of people probably identify as shunned by the mainstream and its cool to write a character, maybe two, for those people to be like, yeah, thats me. Thanks for seeing me. But maybe spread it out over the next 10 books instead of taking the slides from my corporate DEI training PPT and making each one a character. This book will always stink so hard of 2020-2024 that I might not be able to find out what happens to the Cosmere. I just see way too much of Mr. Sanderson's political ideology in the books. Its jarring and ejects me from any deep immersion into the story. I read to escape the buzz kill that is the idiocy of modern politics. STOP DOING THIS BRANDON. I really enjoy your writing style. I love your character development. But please don't ever interject a love story (of any kind, gay, straight, single species, interspecies) into the middle of an epic fight scene. SERIOUSLY. Who read that and thought it helped the story?! Especially when that one frat boy that was in my calculus class and had to cheat off my test to pass but was still cool and invited me to a party once is about to get murked. Just to be clear, I would be equally miffed if there was some malarky about stolen elections or witch hunts or tariffs or whatever the right is getting on about these days too. Just write stories with characters that appeal to most people. I am just one person but I bet I speak for a lot of people. If you must inject your politics, PLEASE. With tact and subtleness. You just turned the most bad a warrior into a therapist. Not cool. The dude that jumped in the arena unplated, without shard blade. Like, John Wick with a spear. Now wears corny glasses and a cardigan sweater. Bruh. This book deserved 1 star but I gave it 2 because I don't want Mr. Sanderson to give up writing forever. I just want him to get back to whatever he was doing when he wrote Mistborn, the first two stormlight books, warbreaker, and most of arcanum.

"B0CPWQZNQB","5","A Brilliant Triumph","Branden Sanderson has truly emerged as one of fantasies great titans. I can’t say anything about the plot because I don’t want to give anything away, but what a testament to the kind of stories that can be written with careful outlining. In some ways, maybe Taravangian is a metaphor for Sanderson’s project, because he must have had this whole thing planned out from the get go. The cosmere books are truly a grand tapestry in the fantasy genre. Sanderson may not have the sentence to sentence elegance of Tolkien, Martin, or Rothus, but he is the GOAT of actually finishing books in a timely manner, and I think Wind and truth makes him the GOAT of planning a great story ark. While other authors get stuck on perfecting one book, Sanderson plunges ahead brilliantly at forging a universe. I think this book finally gives readers a glimpse at the true scope of Sanderson’s ambitious vision for the cosmere and I have every confidence he will deliver another ten years of master pieces as he completes the series.","2024-12-27","United States","","true","72","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P864Z1XDLDCM"

However, starting with the second arc of Mistborn (Wax and Wayne) and continuing through the second half of Stormlight, I found the “meta-plot” of the entire Cosmere struggle to be getting a bit too ponderous and dense. For me, the characters and plots of the individual books and arcs are really starting to suffer due to the author’s need to flesh out the “meta-plot’ of the Cosmere struggle. This was especially true of the Wax and Wayne Mistborn arc, but it has now infected the Stormlight series completely. One shudders to think what will happen once Warbreaker and Elantris sequels are released. This entire book felt rushed and could have used more rigorous editing. The author is rightly praised for his rigor in releasing books on time, however I would have preferred if Wind and Truth had gotten more time in the oven-it really felt half-baked. The plot-line of Kaladin essentially becoming a therapist, was profoundly unsatisfying, as was most of Szeths quest arc. The sojourn in the Spiritual Realm was meandering and unfocused. The Azish scenes were better and more gripping. The book felt a bit too “focus grouped”. I know it’s en vogue for everyone to talk about “their trauma” in popular culture, but to focus on such topics to the extend done in this book was a tad extreme for me. It seems that half of the characters in this book need a very hefty dose of Prozac….I don’t mind nuance and complexity in my hero’s, but Shallan, Szeth, and Kaladin were all reading from the same script of ‘overcoming trauma’, and very similar trauma at that.

Or he doesn't trust us to get his points unless he crams hardly-believable dialogue into character's mouths to explain why they're doing what they are doing. In one scene, Adolin offers to have a spren serve as a messenger for a leader in a command post. Most authors would trust their readers to understand that any rational leader in that situation would accept the offer becuase of the obvious benefits. Not Sanderson. He uses nearly a full page of dialogue and thought process to have his characters explain the benefits of near lightspeed communication and the pressures of the battlefield. Then, finally the leader accepts the offer -- the result that all but the most dense reader expected. Another problem is that the dialogue isn't believable in that situation. People don't talk out their problems like that, especially in a high-stress situation. This formula repeats over and over with almost all decisions. Also, a lot of the dialogue feels anachronistic. I know that term doesn't apply so much with fiction, but here I think it does. People or entities that are thousands of years old, even in Sanderson's world, would not speak the same way his 'modern day' characters would speak. Yet they engage in the same banter the rest of the characters do. It kind of cheapens the experience.","2024-12-10","United States","","true","96","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1U4AKKWK3A5TK"
"B0CPWQZNQB","3","What a mess","This book, the final one in the first half of the STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE, should have either been two books, or more focused. Instead it is all over the place in what are obvious machinations to wrap up storylines in an all too hasty manner. The result is a slow plod through backstories, visions, and occasional new territory. At least the cosmere feels a little bit bigger now.","2025-05-31","United States","","true","97","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NZZ9C64G2CAM"

It’s ripping and breaking and I love my books.","2025-06-29","United States","","true","98","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RRBWHBKR4OOB"
