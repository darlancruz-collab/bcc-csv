"B01NAWAH85","5","Wonderfully-Written Third Installment in The Stormlight Archives","Oathbringer is the third installment of The Stormlight Archive, Brandon Sanderson’s highly-acclaimed series set in the Cosmere. The story has major middle-book vibes, which makes sense considering this is a 5-book series. While it may not have the panache of the first two books in the series, I thoroughly enjoyed Oathbringer. READER BE WARNED, SPOILERS FOR THE WAY OF KINGS AND WORDS OF RADIANCE ARE BELOW. If you have not read my reviews for the first two books, I recommend doing that first as there are continuing themes. When I say “panache” I mean that books 1 and 2 of the series came through like a highstorm, with so much power as to be destructive and restorative at the same time. They were wall-to-wall action, almost never allowing the reader to come up for air, finishing in fabulous style with the way everything culminated at the end of Words of Radiance. And to that I say: take my breath away. I do not need it, for the stormlight will sustain me. Oathbringer, by contrast, is a very typical middle book (if anything Sanderson writes can be called “typical”), more gambit than check chase. With the coming of the Everstorm and many secrets unlocked, Dalinar, Kaladin, et al are resetting and learning a new way of life. The main protagonists have all evolved and are occupying the ancient city of Urithiru, and the Parshmen have been freed. All of the players are moving pieces around the board, searching for an opportunity to put their opponent into zugzswang. This is a long series, and as a reader I enjoyed the break from the constant war, death, and destruction of the first two installments. The way Oathbringer is written, it gives the reader many opportunities to survey the scene, learn more about Roshar, its people and history. One way Sanderson accomplishes this is with flashback narratives, which is an underrated aspect of this series. I do not believe I mentioned this in my previous reviews, so this is a great time to do so. From a writing perspective, flashbacks are hard. If they are going to take my interest away from the main storyline, they should not overwhelm, but at the same time need to be relevant and interesting. This type of narrative can be a detriment to a book if not done well, but when an author finds a balance it can be a boon. That is exactly what Sanderson has accomplished with this seres, as the flashbacks were phenomenal in providing supplementary information, focusing on first on Kaladin and Shallan in the first two books and now Dalinar and the Parshmen in Oathbringer. To me, this provides even more depth to a series that is already overflowing with it. I think that is a good thing, as a story can never be too deep (watch Sanderson take that comment and run with it – not that the encouragement is all that necessary). Another great aspect of Oathbringer is that it really ups the ante for the rest of the series. In the first two books there is a lot of standard warfare, introducing the reader to many of the players and how their powers work. It was a really exciting start, but Oathbringer has a different feeling. The Big Bang at the end of Words of Radiance put the pieces in place to rebuild sections of the story. It is much slower than the first two books, working to a longer crescendo. At the same time, the world is entirely different now. Because the it has changed so much, and because everything is going through a bit of reset, the reader is able to learn so much about this new-age right along with the characters. And that really is the brilliance of Sanderson’s writing overall (as I have come to find), which is that is feels so interactive as the reader is able to experience every event right along with the characters. That feeling of immersion has often been what has made this series so unputdownable, and Oathbringer taking a different narrative path than the first two books in the series is helped by this immersive atmosphere. Here is the thing about the ending: I cannot talk about it. In typical Sanderson style that crescendo that has been building culminates in an unbelievable way. It is easily the best ending of the first three books, and that saying something because I felt that way about each subsequent book in the series. The fact that Sanderson continues to up the ante is impressive, and I left this book with my jaw dropped. While Oathbringer is incredibly well-done, there was one detraction I want to mention. Certain events (small[ish] ones, none of the big reveals) felt rushed to me. There is a scene at the beginning of the book that felt that way to me (if you read it you will know what I am talking about), and a few others like it along the way. I know it is hard to say in a 1,000+-page book, but I would have preferred to ruminate on certain events for a bit. It is a bit of a weird thought because Sanderson at times can be the King of Rumination, so take those words with a grain of salt. This Stormlight Archive continues to be absolutely fabulous. Oathbringer is another phenomenal entry into the series, and yet again gets my highest recommendation. It has set things up for what I expect to be an amazing second half to the series, and I am very much looking forward to Rhythm of War.","2020-12-17","United States","","true","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMJPFE1ILTR8J"
"B01NAWAH85","5","*Review from The Illustrated Page*","Oathbringer is another spectacular installment in one of my all time favorite epic fantasy series. The Stormlight Archive starts with The Way of Kings, which you need to have read (along with the second book, Words of Radiance) before you pick up Oathbringer. I love this series. It’s got excellent ideas, world building, characters, and it’s all exciting enough to keep my flipping the pages in this gigantic book. A lot of times, I’ve found the third volume in an epic fantasy series is where I tend to quit. I start realizing that the plot’s moving super slow, the characters are basically treading water, and then I start asking myself why I’m reading. I was a bit nervous the same would happen with Oathbringer, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. If anything, Oathbringer left me even more invested in this series and willing to follow it to the end, however many decades that’ll take. At the end of Words of Radiance, the Parshendi summoned the Everstorm and became possessed, losing the independence they’d so craved. Dalinar and the Alethi armies have retreated to the city of Urithiru, an ancient stronghold above the force of the storm. Dalinar still has to fulfill his god’s last command: “Unite them.” But the nations of Roshar don’t trust him, seeing all his diplomatic outreaches as pretenses that will lead to an Alethi army on their doorsteps. Meanwhile, the Everstorm has awakened the parshmen, a species the humans have kept enslaved for millennia. The parshmen are angry, and their anger is not unreserved. What looks to have been a simple battle between good and evil grows a lot more complicated. Are the humans of Roshar really in the right? Where The Way of Kings focused on Kaladin and Words of Radiance on Shallen, Oathbringer focuses in on Dalinar. I’ll be honest, when I first started reading, I thought Dalinar was kind of annoying, and I started questioning how I’d liked him in previous books. He felt like such a stereotypical character, you know, the super honorable older warrior. It was boring. But then Sanderson completely flips that on its head. Dalinar has gaps in his memory, something we’ve known about since book one. In Oathbringer, those gaps start to disappear, and Dalinar remembers just what sort of man he used to be and what he’s done. <blockquote>“Sometimes a hypocrite is nothing more than a man in the process of changing.”</blockquote> Of course, other characters have their own arcs. Shallen’s admitted to herself what she’s done, and it’s growing increasingly hard for her to hide from that knowledge. She’s started constructing alternate personas and losing herself in them. She hates herself and would rather be someone else. Obviously, this isn’t exactly a healthy cooping mechanism. Kaladin’s in a much better place than he was in The Way of Kings, but his mental health issues (which I read as being depression) don’t just magically go away. I think this is something he’ll be dealing with for the rest of the series. I hope he finds a way to manage it. I’m really happy Sanderson’s addressing mental health issues, as it’s something that really interests me, especially in a fantasy or historic setting. When the modern combination of drugs and therapy isn’t available, how do you learn to live with your mental health issues and still function? I’m noticing that the Stormlight Archives contains more disabled characters than I normally see in fantasy. Depression, healing from trauma, addiction and other mental health issues are all notable, but there’s characters with physical abilities as well, such as Renarian and Rysn, an apprentice merchant who appears in some of the interludes. She actually has an incredibly badass scene in Oathbringer that’s one of my favorite parts of the whole book. I’ve decided to stop quibbling over the size of these books. Yeah, you could probably find stuff to cut here or there (some of the bridgemen chapters for instance), but this story is suited for a large size. I got an ebook copy so I didn’t have to haul a honking 1200+ page monstrosity around with me, but I do sort of want a hardback copy. The book design looks so gorgeous. Back to the topic of characters, I wish there was more explanation for why Szeth made the major decision he did. That’s probably my main complaint about Oathbringer. Oh, and Eshoni continues to give me so many feels! I mean, they all do, but Eshoni especially. Oathbringer is another installment in a truly great epic fantasy series that’s becoming surprisingly subversive. If you at all like fantasy, please do yourself a favor and read The Stormlight Archives. I love this world and love these characters. My only problem is now I’ve got to wait years for another book, blast it. Still, I’m sure whatever Sanderson writes next will be worth the wait.","2018-01-02","United States","","true","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R389BGXX0NOFG8"
"B01NAWAH85","5","What a great series!","I continue to love this series and have consumed roughly 4000 pages of it in about a month. It’s well-written, full of action, laden with character development, and overflowing with interesting ideas about magic and mythology. For any sheltered fans of the fantasy genre who have not heard of this series or this author, I give it the hugest possible recommendation. I’m just sorry that I finished book #3 in the series a few months before book #4 is set to be released. The third book in the Stormlight Archive series finds the main characters all facing crises: of conscience, of memory, of their personal relationships, and, most importantly, of what they want their lives to become. Kaladin, increasing in his power as a Windrunner (one of the orders of Knights Radiant, reborn after thousands of years), faces one of his periodic bouts of self-doubt, the darkness nearly consuming him into giving up. Dalinar, King of Urithiru (the rediscovered City of Knights Radiant) and uncle to the King of Alethkar, tries to understand his role in the Radiants as a Bondsmith, facing the fracturing of the alliance of nations he formed in the last book. Shallan, betrothed to Dalinar’s son, Adolin, and a Lightweaver Radiant in her own right with the abilities to project illusions and become other people, faces difficulties in deciding which of her alter egos is really her. The supporting cast (Kaladin’s Bridge Four teammates, now Windrunners themselves; Dalinar’s former sister-in-law (and now wife), Navani; Navani’s daughter, Jasnah, seemingly returned from the dead; the Assassin in White, Szeth, somehow still alive and serving as a Skybreaker Radiant trainee; and a host of others from previous books) all face similar crises of faith. Meanwhile, the army of once-Parshendi (many of whom have been transformed into Fused, a sort of counterpart on their side to the Radiants) marches towards a confrontation with the allied forces of man, just when that alliance is crumbling and many of the alliance’s strongest supporters have disappeared into a parallel plane of existence. And along the way, the world discovers a shocking secret about the nature of the conflict that shakes the very foundations of everyone’s beliefs. The plot is incredibly intricate, with dozens of interweaving storylines that all support each other in a grand whole. With so many pages in each novel (each one ranges just above or below 1300 pages), there’s ample space to have complex arcs for every character, even the minor ones, while making sure there’s plenty of plot movement and action. There’s political intrigue, soul-searching inner conflict, pledges to higher ideals, conversations with deities, loads of fighting, and a good bit of humor (thanks to Rock, Lopen, Shallan, and Lift in particular). Even the undercurrent of racism I noted in previous reviews in this series seems to be addressed as one of the main plot points (as I thought it might), and the solution to that problem will likely be central to the later books in this series. It really is one of those books that has so much going on that it’s hard to put down. As for the mechanics, it’s incredibly tight in its editing, a few split infinitives or pronoun errors aside. Page-for-page, it’s one of the cleanest series of books I’ve read in a long time, so kudos to Sanderson and his editorial team for presenting a well-written final product. I can’t say enough good things about this series. Go read it.","2020-06-11","United States","","true","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30Y3TMM2GN7H5"
"B01NAWAH85","4","Revelation after revelation in this action packed Stormlight installment","I had complained (mostly to myself) that ‘The Way of Kings’ and ‘Words of Radiance’ almost felt like the same book and I wondered if somehow they could have been crammed into one volume by cutting some of the fat. I enjoy both of those books and Sanderson’s world-building is incredible in the Stormlight series, but I did get just a tad bored with the sheer amount of plateau runs Kaladin and his team ran, as well as the general setting of the Shattered Plains. Well it’s almost like Sanderson heard me loud and clear when he made Oathbringer, which in itself feels like it has two books worth of content into one volume rather than the other way around. In fact, the first two books almost felt like an insanely long prologue for this one. I’m almost not even sure where to begin actually reviewing this book. The Stormlight series by no means conforms to standard story structures or plot development and it definitely does not borrow from atypical fantasy tropes.The world here is strange and unique and made even more so now that we’re seeing more of it. The action is just as evenly spaced as in the first two books (little snippets of action scattered throughout the tome, punctuated by a giant action sequence at the end) with a lot of that action actually taking place in Dalinar’s past segments. There is actually more political maneuvering and scheming in Oathbringer than there is actual fighting. This part may be boring to some, but I enjoyed it. As readers, we finally get to see past the Plains and the Alethi and get an idea of how some of the other nations work. One thing this book does a lot of, and I mean a lot, is answer questions. The first two books introduce a lot of ideas and give us plenty of hints, but not a lot of concrete answers as to why all of the magic works the way it does and why the Parshendi conflict started the way it did and... you get the idea. I never thought I’d say this, but there may be a point where a story can actually answer TOO many questions. By the end of Oathbringer, I almost felt overloaded with information. It wasn’t that I couldn’t keep track of it all, it was more that I got to thinking, “after all of this, where in the hell is the next book even going to go?” I don’t have a lot to say that hasn’t already been covered in countless reviews of this massive book, so perhaps I’ll break the rest up by the main characters with a few thoughts on their progress through this story. Kaladin: Kaladin remains my least favorite of the primary characters of the Stormlight series. My reasons for this are almost too vague to me to even understand, but I suppose in simple terms, it can boil down to one thing: he’s kind of boring. If this were an RPG, he’s the character I wouldn’t pick because I’d be bored playing him. He doesn’t have character faults, so the only negative things about him are what other people have done to him, not really what he’s done to himself. He’s mopey, sarcastic and distrustful because of his past plights, yet a natural leader and able to motivate anyone. He’s the warrior, the healer and now he’s a super powerful radiant with mastery of his wind powers powers. Kaladin reminds me more of an anime character than someone I could actually meet in real life. I enjoy his chapters, as fun things tend to happen in them, but as a character, I care about him the least. Dalinar: Dalinar has a lot of the same traits as Kaladin but he’s a much more interesting character. His faults are his own. Many of his problems were brought about by his own decisions, some of which he made decades ago, and he’s still working to overcome those faults. He’s noble, but he only got there by learning many harsh lessons along the way. He may also become ultra powerful like Kaladin, but he gets there by a more reluctant path and to me, this makes him more grounded. I had a lot of fun reading about his backstory as well. Shallan: Shallan has previously been my favorite character and she MIGHT still retain that mantle, I haven’t quite decided yet. Her character arch takes a rather strange turn in Oathbringer. It’s not that this turn is completely unexpected, as hints of it are given to us toward the end of book 2, but it puts her in a rather strange place. Or rather... multiple strange places... If you’ve read the book, you might understand that joke. I still think that she has more depth than Kaladin or Dalinar and I always look forward to her chapters more than any others. Those are the primary protagonists, the ones with the most page time. There are several minor characters with POV chapters as well, the most prominent of them being Szeth. I enjoyed Szeth’s parts in this book, though he’s completely changed as a character since the last books. We get to read more about who he actually is now that he isn’t being driven by a destructive force that he felt obligated to oblige. He deals with inner torments based on the things that he’s done while also learning more about his abilities now that he has a proper teacher. And then there’s Lift. Lift was only in book 2 in one of the short stories but now she’s upgraded to secondary character. She also had her own spinoff book that took place before Oathbringer that everyone told me I “had” to read before Oathbringer. I didn’t though and I just read the wiki synopsis. I seem to be in the minority here, but... I don’t really like Lift. I know she’s supposed to be the “fun” character and her carefree attitude is supposed to be endearing but she’s just goofy and out of place to me. Her referring to her abilities as “the awesomeness” and her teenager blase attitude toward everything just sucks any tension out of the scenes she’s in. It’s hard to feel dramatic tension during a major battle sequence when Lift is busy talking about food. That complaint about Lift actually is a sort of undertone for one of my major problems with Oathbringer: there’s too much silly. Most of the silliness is prevalent in with Kaladin’s Bridge Crew, which isn’t entirely new as there’s always silly banter going on between the Bridge Crew. There’s just more of it in this book. I don’t necessarily need all of my fantasy fiction to be bleak, but the level of goofiness sometimes detracts from otherwise serious moments. This is a complaint I haven’t had with Sanderson’s other books I’ve read. The humor in Mistborn, for example, seems more in check. Granted, the tone and setting of Mistborn are more bleak than Stormlight, so perhaps the author feels he can have more fun with the tone. It’s not horrible, just occasionally obnoxious. My other major complaint about this book: it seems to be a vehicle for revelations as much as it is a vehicle for story-telling. There’s surprise and twist after surprise and twist and by the end I felt like I had just read an entire series worth of plot reveals. It’s hard to pinpoint what exactly bugs me about this, as it’s not necessarily a BAD thing, I just felt like perhaps too much mystery was stripped away by the end of the massive tome. Overall, this is a very enjoyable book, despite my complaints. I couldn’t stop reading it, so I definitely enjoyed it. If the 4th book was available at this very moment, I probably wouldn’t read it right away, as I didn’t finish this book thinking “I must read more right now!”, but it was still an epic fantasy in Sanderson’s usual tradition and I am genuinely curious to see where this series is going next.","2018-03-20","United States","","true","4","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MQINCVO3OSTM"

"B01NAWAH85","5","Much to enjoy in Third Book in the Stormlight Saga","While I didn't enjoy Oathbringer quite as much as the first two books in the series, I still feel it's worthy of a 5-star rating. Each of these books has specific characters at the forefront, and in this novel they are Shallan Davar and Dalinar Kholin. There are some aspects of Shallan's character that are fascinating, such as her multiple ""personalities"" or illusions that she adopts to explore and find out who she really is. However, her romance with Adolin felt very awkward, and Shallan spent so much time fretting over her different personalities that it became tedious to me. Dalinar's flashback sequences were jarring to me as well, and although they did provide some insight to his past, I felt they could have been fewer in number. I did enjoy the focus on Dalinar more than I thought I would, however. Where The Stormlight Archive really shines as a series for me, is in two areas, and that's why I'm firm on my 5-star rating here. First is the world-building and magic system. In its cohesiveness and expansiveness, the Cosmere feels almost like Tokien-esque. There seems to be an ever-expanding mythos that is both wondrous and fascinating. Many questions are answered in Oathbringer, but as Sanderson pulls back from his focus on the nation of Alethkar to look at the world in full in this new novel, numerous new possibilities unfold. It is indeed an amazing world to explore. Second, I find the character development really interesting and satisfying, and the moral dilemmas faced by the characters really serve to propel the story forward, with glorious and sometimes tragic consequences.The Dalinar flashback sequences paint the Alethi people as bloodthirsty, immoral savages, a ""Ghengis Khan"" like marauding horde that kills for sport, without mercy or conscience. This presents quite a problem as Dalinar finds himself faced with the return of the Voidbringers. Dalinar needs to use diplomacy to form an alliance to defend their world, but who would believe him? Every nation-state in the world of Roshar seems suspicious, distrusting its neighbors. Some wonder if the Alethi people are worse than the Voidbringers who have come to conquer the world. In a ""Game of Thrones"" way, the Alethi resemble the rulers of Westeros, who all appear corrupt, conniving and treacherous. Dalinar has bonded himself to Honor in the previous book, which requires him to keep his Oaths and integrity. Watching him change as he struggles mightily with this, makes his arc worthwhile. Other characters' moral choices shape them as well. As the parshmen are released by the tens of thousands from their lives of slavery by all the nation-states of Roshar, how will they treat those of Roshar who have enslaved them for thousands of years? Are the parshmen the rightful rulers of Roshar? Many of the main characters in the Stormlight Archive seem have little to no moral center at the beginning. What is interesting is seeing how catastrophic and extreme events are shaping them, and some make sacrificial choices of great integrity, such as the men of Bridge Four who seek to become Knights Radiant, while others sink low and take a path that dooms themselves and others (avoiding spoilers here. .). Some characters who have some transformative moments: -Kaladin as he spends time observing the newly freed parshmen -Venli the Parshendi who paved the way for the Voidbringers' return -Taravangian who is alternately a fool or a genius, an empath or a sociopath, deciding what path to take. -Odium, the enemy, who comes portraying himself as an ""angel of light"" with a golden tongue but a heart filled with ruin and death. -Jasnah Kholin, the great historian and thinker of the Alethi, racing against time to crack the technology of the past to save their future. -Renarin, who has bonded with a void-spren, the forgotten member of Alethi royalty who may be the wild card that can tip the balance. -Lift, with the exuberance of a child, but with powers that rival any of the other Radiants. -Szeth, the Assassin in White, who is no longer forced to kill, but can now make his own choice about the direction of his life. -the men of Bridge Four, who have a new lease on life and who share a bond that has enabled them to achieve great things. All of these characters have time in Oathbringer, some a lot more than others, but watching their choices shape them has been delightful and satisfying. Some of the characters in Oathbringer don't end well- they are not cookie cutter stories. Some crash and burn, some betray their friends and the ones they love. Others reconsider their hate, and choose love instead. While I would have wished for more time for some of my favorite characters like Kaladin, and even Lift, who had the main role in the Edgedancer book that I looked forward to seeing her story continue in Oathbringer (which it didn't), I relished every bit of Oathbringer. This is what sets it apart from most other novels of this and other genres, and I can't give it less than 5 stars with a clear conscience.","2017-11-20","United States","","true","6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CFFF81TLOSU1"
"B01NAWAH85","5","""Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination.""","""Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination."" This is the First Ideal of the Knights Radiant, and if broken into three parts, each phrase encapsulates a book thus far in the series. Book 1, The Way of Kings (5/5 stars), is all about finding the strength to live, even in the face of increasingly difficult odds. No matter how difficult it is to live, at least by living, we can still do something. In death, we are unable to make a difference. It focused on the burdens our heroes faced, and them rising to the challenge and choosing to live and walk the difficult path. Book 2, Words of Radiance, tested our heroes, revealing their mountains in TWOK were only pebbles in their path. It threatened to break them, expose their weaknesses and lay them vulnerable. However TRUE strength can only be forged by facing our darkest secrets, by admitting our weaknesses, we can face them, learn and grow. Words of Radiance was this step in our heroes journeys. Finally, in Book 3, Oathbringer, we find our heroes are all focused on reaching the end, their destination, but this book reminds us that the journey is equally important. We have to look at where we began, reflect on how far we have traveled, and though we may be focused on the destination, what matters most is having the strength and courage to take the next step. Oathbringer is the 3rd of 5 books in the first arc of The Stormlight Archive. As a continuation, it is a masterful, meticulous continuation into our exploration of the mysterious world of Roshar, and our main characters. World building is excellent, with lots of various locales being described and visited, allowing us to learn lots about the people and culture. Some answers to threads left dangling from earlier books are provided, but even more plot points are set up for fans to speculate and theorize about. The book itself is excellent in it's development of characters and the situations they are made to face. Brandon Sanderson does very well in driving us deeper into the growing intrigue of Roshar, and for those who are paying attention, the greater story of the Cosmere. Oathbringer is over 1200+ pages long and though the initial start is slow to build, the story that unfolds feels very natural and organic. The pacing works, as it increases anticipation, allowing moments that surprise or shocks us to connect deeply with the reader. Several major developments occur during the course of the book, of natures both triumphant and soul-crushing. The last fifth, when all the character come together, is an emotional roller coaster, framed by an exhilarating, climactic battle. When this book ends, the payoff is very real, and I cannot stress how amazed I am that Brandon makes this look easy! Oathbringer is another stunning addition to the already impressive Stormlight Archive. My love of this series continuously deepens with each new addition and re-read. This journey impacts on me deeply. Events are starting to come together, but the journey has only begun. A solid 5 stars! A worthy read!","2017-11-22","United States","","true","7","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXUWJC7ZAAT00"
"B01NAWAH85","5","This is no cookie cutter quest into fairyland. Roshar is a land where Gods die, men’s hearts fail them and heroes are born!","If humans still exist when Sol finally burns out and the last few stragglers leave this system for a new home among the stars, clutching a few treasured possessions to begin a new life with, this book would be one of them. Ever wonder what it would have been like to attend the opening night of a Verdi opera? Or walk into a small Italian village and see some lucky violinist buy a brand new Stradivarius? I think we yearn to witness some true high art, to experience firsthand a masterpiece that will set a new bar for excellence in its field. Now is your chance. A hundred years from now, people will still be reading Tolkien and Lewis… and Sanderson. Some fresh young kid will finish the Lord of the Rings or Chronicles of Narnia for the first time and ask their parent or teacher… “What should I read next.” Then with an appraising look, they reach up to the top shelf, grab a huge volume with flowing storm clouds, and say “I think you might be ready for this…” Think I’m overselling it? I’m willing to plant my flag and wait for time to prove the point. Oathbringer was the #1 pre-order of all time on Audible. That means that more people across the world have been paying good money to (digitally anyway) wait in line to listen to this book than any other in history! I personally love the gorgeous cover and end materials, but that’s just me. Regardless, if you don’t want to take my word for it, listen to the thousands of (possible more) that voted with their feet… umm dollars?... and paid for this book up front, sight unseen. What is it about this book, and the Stormlight Archive (the series that Oathbringer is a part of) that has so many fans craving more? I thought you’d never ask… The art of our era is full of moral relativism. Our pop music, films, and books rarely, if ever, take the time to dive into the deep and meaningful questions of life. To ask the hard questions about faith, character, life, and death. Brandon’s books do just that. His characters don’t just walk through highstorms, they walk through hearts. Their journeys are epic, and mythical. There is more than a dash of magic and monsters, but the primary journey is a moral one. The narrative is fascinating because the characters are grappling with demons within and without, with huge world-crushing forces and the great moral questions that philosophers and priests have been asking since the beginning of time. “Is there a God, or anything truly Divine? What is a truly moral life? How should I treat others? Is it right for the oppressed to hate the oppressor? Is vengeance justified? Why do we fear and hate those who are different? How do we find hope and strength when the world is falling apart around us?” I really enjoy Brandon’s worldbuilding, and am highly intrigued by his innovative magic systems. But I love his characters for how they grapple with real moral dilemmas and find the strength to overcome them and carry on. This is no cookie cutter quest or easy jaunt into fairyland. Roshar is a land where Gods die, men’s hearts fail them, and civilizations reel about searching for some hope to cling to. And where heroes are born. I was there at Brandon’s first book signing, back when Elantris was an undiscovered rookie, and will be here for the duration of the journey. Thanks Brandon for an amazing story! I can’t wait to see where you take us next! No, I’m not going to give you major plot lines, spoilers, or hints. I love these books too much to ruin it for you.

"B01NAWAH85","4","Slow start and a strong finish - but we're still left waiting for the next book","In short, this is a great third installment to the Stormlight Archives, and readers will not be disappointed. The core characters are there, doing their stuff, there are plenty of mysteries, revelations, character progression, and it ends up with some incredible moments that are exactly what readers wish for in a fantasy book conclusion. Events are big, bold and exciting. The stakes are high, and the powers and magic are bigger and better than before. If it were a movie, the effects would be better than ever, the running time longer than ever, and the big name actors would all be together in scenes, making all their best quips and speaking character-defining lines. Readers of the first two books are going to enjoy this, and be well satisfied. Anyone who hasn't read the other two books should definitely not start here. That would be crazy. Stormlight Archives is a series that will no more forgive you skipping the first two books than Lord of the Rings would. Oathbringer is not perfect though. It's a long good, and not many authors could write a book this long and be consitent throughout. It's good. Maybe even great, but there are also flaws, mis-steps, and frustrations. The biggest complaint I have, is that Oathbringer is a slow starter. A really slow starter. At first, it meanders, it heads down dead-end paths, it wastes time on characters or events we don't care about much, and attempts to tie up plot-threads left over from previous books that didn't need it, often in unsatisfactory ways. However, once the first third of the book is over, the plot gets moving and the story begins in earnest. From thereon, things are tight and tense, heading for a climax that arrives at the right place in the book and delivers more excitement that anticipated. There's just the right amount of ""tie up"" afterwards. It's a satisfying ending, even if it does end ""Marvel Style"", creating a lot of hooks for the next book in the series. If the first third of the book were ... another book entirely ... Oathbringer would be a good length, tight and well paced from start to finish, delivering satisfactory adventures and revelations for all the characters we've grown to love from the first two books... And those first two books are Sanderson at his best. For me, Stormlight is his most original series, his most interesting setting, and his best characters. The first book of Mistborn was awesome, but alas that series started to flounder in the second book. In contrast, Stormlight is three books, all very as good, and showing no signs of falling into premature resolution just yet. If there's a problem, it's clearly that it's not two books, it's one. It's overlong, and the start is slow, boring and frustrating at once. Every one of those early chapters I felt that I'd been robbed of plot events that could have been great and given a substitute that was merely acceptable in its place. Once the preparation is over, things start to improve, and it keeps on getting better from there. There were events I wanted to see, and threads I wanted resolved, and they weren't covered, and instead we got ... Kaladin doing almost nothing for chapter after chapter... Shallan suffering from unconvincingly articifial personality problems for chapter after chapter ... and a lot of time spend on the fabrial researchers failing to understand that Urithiru is missing its ""zero-point modules"" or something (Stargate Atlantis fans will feel my pain regarding Urithiru - it's a little bit too similar to the city from that show). Stormlight Archives in general, and Oathbringer individually, have - like most Sanderson books - a debt to Wheel of Time, but despite the planned length of the cycle, it doesn't feel like Wheel of Time, which frustrated readers by presenting heroes then whisked them away, repeatedly, denying them a chance to be what they were supposed to be, only to end it all up in a giant fight scene that could never pay back what was stolen. Let us hope that Stormlight doesn't do this... There are some worrying signs in Oathbringer that Sanderson might be considering doing this. Oathbringer does have a giant fight scene, and that it shows up this early in the series is a good indicator that the heroes will be allowed to be the characters we were promised. Nevertheless, there are also signs to the contrary. The ending of Oathbringer is better than the ending of Words of Radiance, and that was a hard act to follow. Unfortunately, it feels like Sanderson has been reacting to criticism of Mistborn having an obvious, dull ending ever since. The problem is that his reaction is misplaced. He tries to keep the reader guessing by undermining expectations. This can end up leaving a feeling of being cheated - as in the Reckoners - by resort to a Deux Ex Machina ending to try and create surprise, depriving us of the obvious good ending we were expecting. Game of Thrones has shown us that bait and switch tactics annoy the majority fantasy audience. If we wanted that sort of thing we could read literary fiction, where there is zero narrative economy and no promise of adherence to genre norms. Sanderson's fear of predictability leads to the worst parts of the Oathbringer, where old threads are tied up in weak ""unexpected"" ways, or character progression is transparently retarded so that other characters can be given more space to shine. I can't say too much about who wins and who loses in this lottery without creating spoilers, though I say that some characters get better personal arcs than others - see below. Yes, problems are solved, weak characters are improved, but its at the expense of previously strong ones, and maybe that didn't have to be the case? In particular, while Shallan isn't diminished in terms of achievements and relevance, her character arc seems to have faltered. With no new revelations to fall back on, we're given some contrived developments to her personality. She is written in a heavy-handed, forced/awkward way that only gets clumsier as the story progresses. Over and over again, Sanderson tells rather than shows. The events themselves are solid, but the writing doesn't support them well. Her inner narrative is particularly trite. Comparison to Julian May, who did an incredible job of nuanced character development in the Many Coloured Land series, is not favourable. May developed characters without frequent resort to lazy ""telling"". In this book, Shallan's inner voice seems more like like it belongs to a YA-fiction or X-Men comic character than one of the lead protagonists of an adult fantasy series. Sure, it's not awful, and the pace of action means you don't notice it so much as you might, but it's not as good as Words of Radiance, and definitely not the best that Sanderson can deliver. There are strong signs that Brandon Sanderson hasn't been getting the editorial assistance he needs to do his best work. The later books of the Reckoners series, with its awkward, mis-timed character-arcs, mid-book climaxes that left you exhausted for the latter half of the book, and other problems show this clearly. A good editor would have spotted those problems and convinced him to fix them... A good editor would have fixed the characterisation of Shallan and Kaladin so their arcs felt natural rather than forced. A good editor would have pointed out the inappopriate use of tell over show when developing those characters. Most importantly, a good editor would have made sure they were listened to and acted on. I can't guess to what extend Sanderson got advice on Oathbringer, or how good the actual comments were, but if it was good advice, he clearly didn't act on some of it. Stormlight Archives has generally fared better than Reckoners or Mistborn. The first two books were not blighted by many dull spots or wasted narrative. Sanderson seems extremely averse to narrative economy of late, frequently attempting to subvert reader expectations. This doesn't always work. It can be frustrating, disappointing, or simply annoying, when a whole books is spent telegraphing an event that never comes, or arrives in the wrong way at the wrong time, leaving an empty, hollow feeling of disappointment - a sensation of being cheated by the author - again Reckoners showed the worst of this, but... There are still points where you will end up thinking, ""this never got resolved, or that was made into a big deal, then turned out to be nothing, or that other thing was made out to be important and then ended up being a dead end."" Ryse is a good example. She needed more time, more chapters, more development. Instead, we get a huge dump of her unconvincingly info-dumping on us in her inner narrative. This is pure ""telling"", zero show. What a waste of a character. And after the Lift novella, there wasn't enough Lift in Oathbringer. We could have had these things if the first third of the book had been trimmed appropriately, or pushed out into its own ""Dune Messiah"" sized Novella. I believe that if the first third of Oathbringer had been split off into one of those novellas that Sanderson loves, and paired with the Lift novella, it would have improved the pacing of Oathbringer measurably. Despite the time allocated, Kaladin's plot threads weren't tied up well, and that undercut his development in the rest of the book. Shallan's situation wasn't well established either. Instead of evolving from the end of book two, it was just presented to us, with no real justification, entirely as ""telling"" and narrative info dumps. Sadly, after finishing Oathbringer, I can't see how Kaladin or Shallan are supposed to be developing, what they need to overcome, or how they might overcome it, and this means their character arcs have become arbitrary. While we are told very clearly what they cannot do, it feels too often that their character arcs serve the plot, and so their development stalls or advances in directions that lack a proper internal consistence of character. Too often, inner narrative becomes inner excuses for the latest plot shift. If Kaladin had revisted, and build on his earlier concerns about integrating the role of healer and warrior (and their resolutions) as shown in the previous two books - in a way that the reader could see that progression - it would have been better. Instead we're just told things happen - until the big ""reveal"" moment. In the big reveal we have him failing in ways that were already resolved. Moash was the plot point of book two. It was done. How can it be stronger by being repeated? It isn't, it's weaker. It feels like a cheat. The internal monologue that tries to explain this is weakened because it ignores previous events to such a great extent. Kaladin is just a puppet of the plot. We lose faith in the honesty of his character arc, and are frustrated when his actions come out of nowhere, explained only by inner narrative. The clumsy linking between the parshmen slaves and the human slaves in Kaladin's memory is so forced, it doesn't work. We never learned to like the parshmen in the early sections. They were just a nuisance stopping Kaladin doing cool stuff and holding up the plot. Their later return just makes us like them less. At least, that's how I felt about it. I did not feel that Sanderson made those characters compelling or built any genuine empathy with them. If Shallan's fragmentation were more properly established from the start, and there was a proper inciting event, and real reasons for why she doesn't integrate her selves, we would feel that a resolution of the problem or a worsening was meanginful. Instead it just proceeds to suit the plot, and the internal monologue that tries to justify it falls flat. Fortunately, as the supposed main hero of this book, Dalinar's arc works better than that of the other main heroes. His developments and early history are awesome. The only problem is it makes it hard to believe Sadeas would ever have dared go up against him. The character were Sanderson does best is Adolin. He doesn't overshadow the main heroes, but his developments are organic, well founded, and believable. They don't feel arbitrary or forced. They aren't presented entirely in his inner voice. We're shown how Adolin acts, not told. His character doesn't have to bear too much weight in the plot, and so he's allowed to develop in his own way without having to have his powers vary just make the plot work, and yet the things he does have huge plot implications and great emotional resonance. Speaking of historical revelations that don't quite gel with events we've been shown directly, re-reading the first two books after reading this made it obvious that Sanderson's ideas about how certain powers work, about the cognitive realm, about how spren work, how spren live and function, have all changed significantly since the earlier books. No matter how he tried to keep it vague, or try and paint over the changes, there are clear differences and disconnects that are hard to explain. The idea of how spren interface with the physical realm remains a bit of a shaky convenience, and there isn't the feeling that it's entirely well thought out. Oathbringer could have fixed a lot of that, but has really only muddled it further. I suspect some of these ideas were formed part way through Words of Radiance, and it was partially fixed to accomodate them, but the job wasn't completely finished. One major ""clunk"" is that Pattern treats the Recreance as an event in book 2. Where did he get this point of view? It turns out to be largely wrong, as were his explanations of spren origin, which seem at odds with the description of spren parentage. While Sanderson can probably wallpaper over this in later books, it does make it frustrating that we're told crucial things that are wrong (or lies) by characters who act as if they have first-hand knowledge, and are generally truthful on other similar topics. While the new developments work well, there are problems with them too. A bit like the wibbly-wobbly-timey-wimey grade nonsense of the multiple dimensions in Reckoners, the cognitive realm remains a problem. Sanderson is trying to keep it mysterious, while also trying to make it work consistently. These two things can't easily be reconciled. He's going to have to come down on one side or the other soon, or the following books will feel like the cognitive realm maguffin is being used to justify too much that should have been explained by proper character development instead. But in conclusion. If you read the first two, read this. If you haven't read the first two but like Sanderson, or Wheel of Time, or fantasy epics like Game of Thrones, then you should read the Stormlight Archives books, but don't start with the third one!","2019-08-31","United States","","true","9","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2356VXRPZYHL6"
"B01NAWAH85","1","One of the WORST books I've read, and I LOVE the first two.","First let me say that I have a GREAT deal of respect for Brandon and his work. I go WAY out of my way to recommend his stuff to people, and have recently even purchased a few copies of The Way of Kings for friends of mine who I knew would like it but I couldn't get them to get up and get the book. (and they loved it) I also listened to every single season of Writing Excuses at least 4-5x and consider it a significant part of what as made me into whatever ""level"" of writer I am currently, which I'll say I would classify as ""I don't totally suck"". I also actively encourage other writers to do this and, yes, have gone as far as handing them a DVD with 10 seasons of writing excuses to listen to. (free to download, FYI) So, it's fair to say I am a Brandon Booster. But this book is disappointing on many levels. In the interest of just trying to provide some information that I hope will be valuable to any who might read it. I’m going to approach this essentially unemotionally, and address each issue briefly. In summary, though, this book honestly feels like an early draft that they pushed through without much external editing. Every writer, no matter how good, starts with manuscript that needs tons of love to bring it to the final product. This one reads very much like that. Why they let this book get published this way is beyond me. Perhaps it’s just because it’s been so long and the fans were screaming. Perhaps Brandon has become so big that the editors have been told to go easy. Whatever the case, this book was not finished and not to the level of quality I expect from an author who I believe to care very deeply about a quality product. Here are my issues in no particular order… (and note that many points bleed into other points because the issues I find in this book permeate the entire text) First, this book is full of unnecessary material. There is much in here that contributes only to pacing problems. You can literally skip whole chapters and it will have no substantial impact on your understanding of the story, the characters, etc. One could argue that maybe there are things I’m skipping that will matter in future books, but with these books being so long, and so far apart in release, there is likely no way I’m going to remember it all by the time I get there anyway. I’ve also gone back to a number of sections I skipped and double-checked… and nope… nothing lost. From the writer’s perspective… and I learned this from Brandon, himself… cutting the book down nearly always makes it stronger. Second, this book has a great many of what my friends and I are laughingly calling “meetings and conference calls”. There are endless chapters where there are people sitting around debating something or talking about something. Rarely can I tell you what the debate was about, because the debates themselves are not even interesting. Even the characters are, in some cases, complaining about sitting around in meetings. This is such a running theme in the book that I’ve started to call it “Brandon’s Book of Meetings” and part of me has to wonder if he’s starting to spend more of his personal life in conference rooms and it’s just leaking into his prose. From the writer’s perspective… and I learned this from Brandon, himself… characters not actually “doing” anything tends to be dull and uninteresting. Third, this book focuses on viewpoints that we mostly don’t care about. Kaladin takes a back seat and we’re spending time with secondary characters that mostly are window dressing in previous books. It’s possible that some of these characters are more interesting than we think, and in at least one case that turns out to be true. But for most of them, it is not. The “interlude” characters are particularly painful for the most part because they are often about people we’ll never see again, and on the rare occasion that we wind up interested in them, poof… we’re back to Dalinar in a conference call. Granted, this is more of a personal opinion than some of the other points. From the writer’s perspective… and I learned this from Brandon, himself… too many characters can cause issues in a book. Switching characters can force the reader to deal with a character they’re not interested in, and the ramp up time can literally lose your reader. Fourth, our main characters have faltered significantly. Shallan becomes ridiculously whiny and tries to hide from herself. Kaladin falls so victim to his own nonsense that he fails to uphold the one tenet of his character that constantly makes us love him anyway. Dalinar turns into some failed attempt at a diplomat. And Adolin… poor Adolin… becomes nothing more than a back-seat love interest who mostly just occasionally grunts remarks at Kaladin when Kaladin is telling him to do things. From the writer’s perspective… and I learned this from Brandon, himself… hesitant characters are hard to pull off. The characters must be active. Flawed, certainly, but striving towards some ideal. Rarely can you get away with whiny or inactive characters. Fifth, the voidbringers largely turn out to be postal workers and cooks. The bulk of the looming horrifying bad thing turns out to be mostly just people, just like everyone else. Just as tired and confused as any other people suddenly pressed into war. While this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, the looming evil of the book sort of fizzles out and becomes “mostly people” who are led by some big baddies that only occasionally show up and in small numbers, and are hardly bringing anything close to “the desolations”. Heck, they just kind of move in, kick out the occupants of the city, and treat their captives extremely well. It’s like a benevolent army of postal workers. It’s really weird. There could be some big surprise coming, but we’ve not maintained the urgency here. From the writer’s perspective… you have to keep the threat levels up or the reader isn’t worried about the characters anymore. This is compounded by the next point. Sixth, we have leveled up certain characters to a point where they are essentially gods, and even gone as far as bringing some previously killed characters back from what we thought was their death. This means that pretty much all sense of concern over these characters possibly dying flies out the window… hell, they can’t even lose limbs at this point. So, every scuffle they get into, I just yawn. From the writer’s perspective… and I learned this from Brandon, himself… if you have super powerful characters, you must ensure that they are dealing with even more powerful enemies, or some sort of conflict that is well outside of their zone of power. And no, struggling to keep awake during meetings is not an interesting conflict. Seventh… Spock’s second set of eyelids. Yes, I know we have characters that are learning new powers pretty much on the fly, but no, you cannot just insert a sentence like “Oh, and it turns out that you don’t need to breathe when you have stormlight so Shallan was totally fine” and expect to get away with it. And there is a fair bit of this going on in the book, so… again… I’m just assuming that our characters will pull out some new trick they didn’t know about previously to solve whatever issue they’re now facing, further reinforcing the god character problem. Unless, of course, they suddenly and pointlessly die. (next point) From the writer’s perspective… and I learned this one particularly from Brandon as he is famous for making this point… magic systems must have rules, and you must foreshadow enough so that the changes are surprising but inevitable. (two things laced into one here, but they are two different things) Eighth, many deaths are abrupt meaningless. This happened in a prior book and was later kind of explained by the fact that the person was not actually dead at all, which has its own issues, but we can accept that I suppose. But multiple times in this series, someone is building up to a major conflict with another character, and then that character just dies in a back-alley stabbing (categorical, not literal). Sure, we have that looming thing of “oh wait, they’ll come back from the dead later maybe?” but you’re left feeling cheated or just played with, and neither is good. From the writer’s perspective… and I learned this from Brandon, himself… you have to make your character’s deaths mean something. Ninth, there are crazy pacing issues. This does relate a lot to just the overall unnecessary content in the book, but not entirely. We spend endless time on meetings where nothing of import happens, and then we take a growing character from nothing, to suddenly becoming a radiant- which was never foreshadowed- to dead. All in about a paragraph or two. It’s literally like “oh… he’s a radiant. I guess? That seems… unexpected and almost deus ex machina… oh wait. Never mind. He’s dead. Oh and Brandon made a point to make sure we understand he’s really dead, probably because we don’t believe him anymore because he brought people back to life.” From the writer’s perspective… and I learned this from Brandon, himself… pacing is extremely important. You have to match the speed of the prose with the mood of the scene in question. Tenth: Lift. Seriously. She is, hands-down, the most amazing, fascinating and humorous character in the book. The entire book should be about her, from her perspective, and everyone else should be a secondary character. She is quite literally breathtaking to read, and has been since the first time we met her. And we, at best, get a paragraph or two of her now and again, with our main… and far less interesting characters… doing little more than scratching their heads and saying “wow, she was odd”, then shrugging their shoulders and going back to their meetings. We either need all of Brandon’s characters to be as interesting as Lift, be given far more of her POV, or have her removed from the book entirely. By the way, Taravangian flirts with this issue as well. Also a fascinating character that we barely get to see, though not nearly so impactful as Lift. From the writer’s perspective… and I learned this from Brandon, himself… you cannot have one character so outshine your other characters that they become the focus of the book and pull the attention away from the main characters. Brandon famously talks about some villain that he injected late into one of his other books. The character was amazing, and his editor agreed that the character was amazing, but his editor made him pull him out anyway because it was too much of a distraction. This is that same scenario over again, only Lift is not a “bad guy”. Eleventh: The LGBTQ+ thing. My original review harped on this issue in particular because for a portion of the book it really stood out. It pales over time by comparison and doesn’t come up much beyond that section, but it still needs a mention. The whole LGBTQ+ “issue” in our society is an important one, and yes, it’s good to bring it up and discuss it. However, I still believe that the tenet of “you must have what’s IN the book be important TO the book”. Yes, any common society is going to have LGBTQ+ elements to it, and Brandon’s book has society. But any common society will also have issues with a variety of other things that are not addressed in this book… likely because they are not important to it. Frankly, the entire thing feels forced. From the writer’s perspective… write what’s important to the story. Cut the rest. And yes, I learned all of this from Brandon. Which begs the question of why Brandon, or at least his editors, did not listen to his own advice. There may be more, but I’m tired of writing this and my kids want donuts, so I’ll wrap this up. The tragedy of all this is I think I may be done with Brandon. This was such an utter disappointment. I have no heroes in life. I’ve just never been that kind of person. But Brandon has been someone who I have held in extreme high regard for his craftsmanship and contribution to an art form I hold dear. He’s been the model of who I want to become, even knowing full well the odds are ridiculously not in my favor of attaining it. And suddenly, my model has fallen apart right in front of me. I’m very disappointed. Very. Dissapointed.","2018-01-13","United States","","true","10","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RP48MJ5SZRQD"
"B01NAWAH85","2","This level of character assassination should be criminal.","Now I'm not one for writing reviews. Like so many, Brandon Sanderson had me hook on his works since I laid hands on Mistborn. If I had a gushing review to give or if Oathbringer was a modest 300 or 400 pages or so I wouldn't have bothered. However, Oathbringer is whooping 1200 pages and oh, Stormfather the level of disappointment is strong in this one. Yes, my friends, this will a negative rant style review with a hint of spoilers. And a long one at that, you are forewarned. After reading this doorstopper, I've come to the conclusion that Oathbringer is nota story but a revenge fan-fic. It’s almost like, Sanderson got so annoyed with his fans pestering him for answers and went out his way to give it to them in so artless and bland a fashion that I can literally taste the spite. Dying to know about the Recreance and the reason(s) behind the Knights Radiants desertation? I won't say specifically what it is but my reaction was, ""That's it? Really?"" People are not their ancestors and no matter how bad the original sin was, nothing justifiies centuries of desoulations which are essentially wholesale attempted genocide and planetary destruction. The knights of old walking away like that is basically giving the greenlight for the mass extinction of their own kind. How about the story behind Evi and Dalinar's dealings with the Nightwatcher. Yeah... the reveal was a huge letdown too. What happened to Evi was bad but Dalinar's reaction was a bit much. He's a 50-something war-hardened warrior not some 20-something, lovestruck greenvine. If these were my only gripes, I would give Oathbringer maybe a 4 or a 4.5 but NOPE. All the fan favorites get a healthy portion of POVs in this book and Oathbringer makes a concerted to make me wish them dead. Anxious to see who else is going to become a Knights Radiant? Sanderson managees to kill the excitement for that too. The first two books had me burning through riveted to Kaladin's and Dalinar's struggles to speak the words for the next ideal. Now, I won't be surprised if everyone and their grandmother will become a knight by the end. It really so bad, that Sanderson had a character leading on the fourth wall speaking to how ridiculously easy it is to become a knight. All you need to do is angst about your life problems while repeating the words Kaladin figured out. Maybe one time I had Adolin would be one but now I really hope he stay normal. Dalinar became the ineffectual diplomat struggling to create the human resistance, i.e. the coalition, and deal with day to day management of the mass settlement of the strange and mysterious Urithiru. Ever wonder why the Way of Kings had introduced the world of the Shattered Plains 6 years after the enactment of the revenge pact? Because reading about the difficulties of developing infrastructure is BORING. Yes, the ancient headquarters of the old knight radiance is weird and unknowable, I GET IT. That’s not all, Sanderson finally tells the story behind Evi and Dalinar’s deal with the Nightwatcher through flashbacks. I’m going to be honest; I hate flashbacks. I think they are terrible literary devices which do nothing but pad a story and add fake suspense. Dalinar’s backstory could’ve been told in two or maybe three flashbacks. What we get is at least a half dozen to finally learn a serious letdown of answer. To make matters worse, after Dalinar finally remembers, he becomes an inconsolable angst-ridden mess. So much so, Navani had to be used as POV in his stead to keep the coalition alive. Navani is NOT a good substitute for Dalinar and neither is Ialai a good substitute for Torol Sadeas. Sanderson, don’t try to make parallels it doesn’t work. Both Kaladin and Shallan are both a tragedy of character regression. Because this book is so wanting in action, Kaladin gets all broody and withdrawn to the point that Syl had to wonder what the hell is wrong with him and suggest he gets laid by a certain redhead. Speaking of Shallan, oh Shallan… Her POV could’ve been interesting with the split-personality conflict and the Ghostbloods. But like with any potentially interesting thread in this book, it either gets dropped or so overdone that the reader just does an eyeroll and wish it over already. I secretly think Sanderson hates Shallan. There’s just no other way to explain the handling of her character. It’s just BAD. It’s so awful that Jasnah has to nearly break the fourth wall and voice her disapproval of Shallan’s marked regression.. I understand that progress is not necessarily linear but Shallan was so much stronger in Words of Radiance than she is here. Instead of the proverbial one step forward and two steps back, in Oathbringer, it’s one step forward a kajillion steps back, to the side and off a cliff. Yes, Shallan had pretended to act like Jasnah or wished herself more confident and self-assured but she was aware that she was still herself in the previous book. Here, Shallan became a flighty ditz so filled with self-loathing that she convinced herself that her personas Veil and Lady Radiant were more real than herself. Never mind that the two are constructs and everything they do or say is really Shallan. Again, the split-personality conflict could’ve been interesting if Shallan understood what she was doing, came to terms with it and used the constructs as tools to make herself stronger. That didn’t happen. The conflict was so overdone that Sanderson had to shove Wit into the role of guidance counselor / therapist to yell at her that the personas are fake, it’s all you now put on your big-girl pants and grow up. Of course, Shallan didn’t listen to any of that let herself become lame. Oh, about the Ghostbloods that thread was dropped like a hot potato as soon as it got interesting. As for Adolin, he doesn’t get too many POVs, which, as far as Oathbringer is concerned, is a blessing. He handles living as a norm in a world of supers, having a crazy girlfriend and another devastating spoiler event with a surprising amount of aplomb. Because of this, his chapters were rather refreshing compared to the mess that is Shallan, the hamstringing of Dalinar, and brooding Kaladin. I guess I hate Adolin for having chapters to few and far and between. There are other POVs in the story, however most of them were handled awfully. Yes, I liked Bridge Four but in the context of Kaladin. I did not need to see their viewpoints and certainly couldn’t care less about Moash whose motivations doesn’t even make any sense and only looks he used as a way to give Kaladin another tragic enemy. It’s not like Kaladin needs another one of those. I really don’t want to deal with chapters of Kaladin whining about not being able to save Moash. Venli as a POV could have been interesting if she was Eshonai. Seriously, Venli is the “wrong the sister” to tell that story. It’s almost like Sanderson regretted killing off Eshonai and tried to make her live again through Venli. No, just no. If you’re going to kill a character, then stick with the decision and move on. None of this, character y is character x come again. Taravanagian could have been interesting with his on-again off-again mad genius but the whole Da Vinci Code Cult Diagram thingy got tiresome after a while to point that I wish the man would suffer a stroke and save me from reading anymore of his chapters. The Lift chapters were good though. After slogging through a thousand pages of mind-numbing tedium, Sanderson throws the reader a bone with a large-scale fight scene in Thaylen. I’m not abashed to say I screamed with glee. However, even this fight scene pales in comparison to the drama and well choreographed scenes of the Scattered Plains. What made it so unsatisfying was the heavy-handed use of Deus Ex Machina. Now, I’m a fan of anime and JRPGs and don’t a mind a little sprinkling of DEM. However, this is just storming horrible. I thought I was reading a fan-fic with some inexplicable attraction to Jasnah and Renarin. DEM comes in when Sanderson literally writes himself into a corner with trapping Kaladin, Adolin and Shallan in Shadesmar with no way out AND putting Dalinar in an unwinnable situation of forcing Odium into a showdown. It really has to be read to be believed even the Stormfather was left thinking, ""WT EFF?"". Then there was Jasnah. How did she get so strong? Did she treat her time in Shadesmar as if she were in the hyperbolic time chamber of Dragon Ball Z? Maybe… In book 2, Jasnah hinted that her understanding of soulcasting was modest maybe borderline intermediate. Now she’s soulcasting like a boss and expertly wielding Ivory as if she has years of experience in combat. It was ridiculous how she laid waste to all her enemies. Everybody struggles with fighting the fused, even Kaladin. But not Jasnah, no. She did not even look at the two fused as she lazily waved her hand at them, dispatching the fused as if they were flies. Jasnah needs to drag Shallan into Shadesmar, disabuse her of this Veil/Lady Radiant nonsense and just train all day. Don’t leave until Shallan’s hair turns platinum blond or jet-black or whatever it does to indicate a Super Saiyan equilvalent of a Knight Radiant. I honestly believe that just her, Dalinar, Renarin could have ended the series right then and there taking down Odium, his champion, and his whole army with their brokenness. With auto-regen from a constant supply stormlight the only thing stopping Jasnah would be her squishiness. Even that might be a moot point. I wouldn't be surprised if he had her own shardplate. Otherwise, how did Jasnah know about it to use as a counter when Shallan made the whiny assertion that she doesn’t need to listen Jasnah because she’s full a knight radiant. I wouldn’t put it pass Jasnah to not wear it just because the thought of wearing bulky is an affront to her sensibilities. Even if she doesn’t, Renarin could just soak of the damage of enemy attacks as her tank. I know what you’re thinking, “Dorky little Renarin being a tank? Does not compute.” Again, his fight with the Thunderclast needs be read to be believed. If all else fails, Dalinar could use his DEM powers to put an end to Odium. Whew, long rant over. As a side note, I'd still put in my pre-order for book 4. Why? Because no author can be on top of his or her all the time especially for a long running series. If Oathbringer is the worst of them I would be happy. For all my nit-picks, I still finished the book and it is definitely not the worst I ever read. Besides, the ending gave me some hope that things would be better next outing. The Ghostbloods thread looks like it’s picking up again. Shallan realizes that she’s should consider Veil and Lady Radiant a rest. And Dalinar acknowledges that he’s a general and ain’t got no business playing diplomat. All good signs for things to come.","2020-09-21","United States","","true","11","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRU38HX1R1EQW"
"B01NAWAH85","3","Sanderson's First Real Misstep","Oathbringer is easily the weakest in this series, and maybe the weakest book Sanderson has yet written. Which is not to say it's bad, but it's definitely a mixed bag, that was ultimately unsatisfying. Way too many characters getting way too much time. Between the interludes and all the secondary characters getting multiple chapters, it stopped being cute. I really did not need a bunch of chapters from Teft's POV. His story should have been revealed through interactions with another main character. Worldbuilding is not great: Yeah, I know, the world of Roshar and the Cosmere has been very thoroughly planned out with much subtlety of shading, but none of the characters really know anything still. This is frustrating. I'm several thousand pages into this series, and the reader still doesn't really understand this history of this world, how the Radiant orders function, how Shadesmar works, how Soulcasting and fabrials work, what happened to the Heralds and Honor, Odium's whole deal. The characters we read don't really know, so the reader doesn't know. Sanderson gives the reader a superficial knowledge of how this world works, but there are so many different magic systems and nations, it's tough to keep track of it all, and nobody lays down the rules. Compare this to the Wheel of Time, how the One Power works, and saidin and saidar, is almost completely known by the end of the first book. Without this knowledge, the stakes are very highly obscured. We're back to the mopey Kaladin. Yeah, he's always pretty mopey, but he seemed to make a serious change in Words of Radiance, and now he's back to being frozen with grief when it counts. Times are really tough in this book. I had to put this thing down simply because it was so bleak for so long for just about everybody. Kaladin's failure when it really counted was just completely dispiriting because it didn't make any sense. There was no good reason for him to fail to protect. His freezing was bull, he's just overwhelmed by all the players in the scene and just wishes they could all stop fighting. That was frustratingly stupid and unbelievable. And nothing that came out of later made up for it. I feel like Sanderson was trying to do something different for Kaladin to avoid a pattern of Kaladin ""leveling up"" in every book. OK, fine, worthy goal, but all Sanderson produced here was a character stagnating and stalled out. Sanderson builds a magic system that grants new powers to a character who has realized and committed to some particular truth. In Kaladin's case, his moral journey produces his recognition of a particular duty ""I will protect those who cannot protect themselves"" and ""I will protect those I hate so long as it is right"", and with that commitment to an ""Ideal"" he gets new powers. Well, what happens when you want to avoid the consequences of ""Character development=new cool powers"" is Sanderson forced to avoid Kaladin's progression as a character. In Oathbringer, Kaladin is indecisive and full of self doubt, and when it seems like he's going to rise to the occasion with some new insight, purpose, and yes POWERS, instead he falters, and is excused from being the hero. He's actually told to stop trying to save people and let someone save him. So, Kaladin spends 1300 pages going nowhere really. Shallan's story was painful in this book. I didn't like her in the first book, and I dreaded hearing that she was the main character of Words of Radiance, but then she turned out to be a great read in Words of Radiance. Her story in this one was predictable and stretched out. Truths she had faced in WOR, she's suddenly back to shunning and running from in this one. Like Kaladin, she takes a major step back in this book. And why? So we can read about Teft's drug problems, or the wicked and selfish Venli's tepid redemption, or Moash's emptiness? Who really cares about them? These aren't even secondary characters, they're tertiary characters. Jasnah and Renarin were characters I wanted POVs from. Not a drug addicted bridgeman or a selfish parshman. Renarin and Jasnah have got actual really interesting things going on, and we're almost completely prevented from getting their story. Also, Shadesmar sucks. Turns out it's pretty much like the regular world, though I don't know why that would be. But it's pretty similar, so it's pretty boring when the characters are stuck there. I haven't mentioned Dalinar really, even though he was my favorite character in the past two books, because so much of his story here is really the flashbacks. He doesn't really know what he's doing in the present, and the flashbacks are only fine. They're not shocking or really original, but tell his history capably, even though it didn't change my view of him from what the reader already knew going in to this book, which is that Dalinar is a man filled with regret about his wild, violent younger days. It turns out those days were considerably more violent and wild than the reader probably thought, and his regret and grief are likewise considerably stronger too, but that just means the story is different in degree, not in direction. Thus, Sanderson did not need to spend quite as much time on it as he did. Which is true of most of this book. Not enough really satisfactorily happens despite the length. I guess plenty of plot unravels, but it doesn't feel like Kaladin, Shallan, or Adolin progress enough. The Adolin murdering Sadeas storyline is COMPLETELY botched by the way. That was a total shocker at the end of WOR, and it settled a cloak of doom around confident carefree young Adolin, but it doesn't change his character at all in this book, and he suffers no consequences at all for it. Ridiculous. The Adolin/Shallan/Kaladin love triangle is handled poorly. I had the impression from WOR that Shallan liked Adolin, but connected on a deeper level with Kal---another uncomfortable truth that she didn't want to face. Well, 1300 pages later, we learn NOPE. Adolin gets her you see, simply because he likes her for who she is. Never mind that by the end of this book, Shallan still doesn't know who she is. Ugh. These failures are especially bad because they were major threads set up in WOR, and here they were either discarded or summarily wrapped up. What does this bode for plot lines set up in this book regarding how they will turn out in the next book? Not good. Oddly, Oathbringer is great in the first 32 chapters (coincidentally released online in the weeks before the book came out), stalls out for the next thousand pages or so, then comes roaring back to life with a 300 page climax. So, the beginning and end are pretty great, but only on a surface level. Nothing really happens for Kaladin, what happens for Shallan and Adolin is shallow, and what happens with Dalinar is downright confusing though it is pays off from a thematic and emotional level. Lift makes an entertaining appearance, though she still feels anachronistically off in this world (if she were from another world, like Vivenna, it would make more sense, but she's not ... so ....), Szeth has some good stuff, but it's stretch that a guy who is full of self-loathing and grief because he swore to obey others would feel like the best path forward is .... swearing to obey another man. Oathrbinger is still good because stuff happens in an interesting place, with high stakes, and interesting characters. Sanderson remains a good writer. But its flaws are manifest. Way too many characters that the reader has no real reason to care about doing things that don't seem to matter. Character stagnation or regression for two main characters, Shallan and Kaladin. Too much happening that is obscure, lowering the stakes. Sanderson has delivered over and over on a bigger scale (The Wheel of Time), so I don't think he's failed to live up to the hype here. But there are reasons for deeper concerns. The frustrating slog of this book coupled with his sudden cancellation of the Apocalypse Guard series, leaves one to wonder if he's lost his fastball, and starting to lose himself a little bit. Sometimes a great artist gets so caught up with trying to do something new and pushing the boundaries, that they stop doing what they're good at. Like a great band that refuses to play their hits later in their career, even though their new album kinda sucks. If Sanderson is so desperate to avoid a pattern (Kaladin gains insight and levels up) that he torpedos the character's growth and effectiveness, then that's a REAL problem. He should have found a way to make the pattern interesting, and he's got the skills and character insight to do it. So why wasn't it done in Oathbringer? That question will linger for the next several years until Book 4 arrives. For the first time in a long time, Sanderson is leaving his readers uneasy about what the future holds.","2017-11-27","United States","","true","12","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RV5ZUJZ8HN2R"

"B01NAWAH85","5","We are all heroes in this journey","I have particularly been enjoying listening to Mr. Sanderson’s Stormlight Archive series via Audible. These books represent to me The Hero’s Journey in fiction form and provide a most interesting interpretation of the various parts of ourselves that are involved in this heroic journey of remembering who we truly are. I find the narration to be excellent and such that, at times, I’ve actually gasped out loud. While I still have 43 hours left to listen to this wonderfully long book, I find this book doesn’t quite hold my attention as the previous 2 books – and for me, I think the reason is because of going back in time into the characters’ memories. When going back into the memories something seems to happen, the thread of the storyline is weakened somehow and I’m just not as engaged in the story anymore. I very much appreciate learning more about the past that has contributed to their current character, so I’m just not sure what’s causing this. Maybe it’s my own exposure to the Shattered Plains of my life over the years and the realization that the egregore god that I once so dearly loved is dead and not who I was led to believe. Shattered Plains indeed! Anyway, I look forward to reading and learning more about this journey through this series of books as it inspires my imagination to continually grow outside of the tiny box of reality that society has imposed upon us all.

"B01NAWAH85","4","Epic!","Wow this book was a beast to get through. Took me four months. But I was able to devour the second half of this book within a couple weeks. So much happened I don't even know how to summarize or express thoughts on everything. Kaladin is still my favorite. Always and forever. Dalinar's character is so complex now, his throwback chapters were fun while also sometimes incredibly difficult to read. I am so proud of where he ended up at the end of this one. Shallon just has lost appeal for me. I detest her 30 personalities. It all comes across incredibly selfish even though I recognize this is a form of trauma response for her. I sort of feel Adolin deserves better. Bridge Four will always be EVERYTHING. Loved every single chapter of theirs. Teft<3 Szeth seems to be on the path to being such a unique character. And his sword makes me laugh. Lift's dialogue with Dalinar was such a nice break in all the doom and gloom. I'm eager to see where Venli's character arc goes. Will Adolin be able to bring back Maya? Moash can just go die. Jasnah and Renarin feel slept on. We need more from these two. Shadesmar was a cool place to be but at the same time felt like we spent a little too long there. I think that was a possible issue throughout the book, especially the first half. We just spent so much time on chapters that didn't progress the story much at all. The quality in writing of this one compared to book 1 has drastically reduced. Which was a bummer. I felt it slipping in book 2.

"B01NAWAH85","4","Could have gone a lot more quickly","I'll give 4 stars since I feel a book this size deserves a decent rating, and since there were many parts of the book I really enjoyed reading. Throughout the prose felt well done, and clearly a great deal of time and effort went into this book. That said... This book falls into the same trap all three of Sanderson books in the series have fallen into, they are huge and the move at a truly glacial pace. That does frustrate me. Technically this book is broken into 5 sub books, and while Sanderson does an excellent job of everything building towards a huge really cool conclusion, it spends most of the book slogging it's way there. Probably 85% of the book your thinking, I hope this gets interesting later because this is taking forever and is pretty depressing. It's actually similar to The Way of Kings, where there's a cool start then for a lot of the rest of the books its 'bridges... running... feeling bad... spear training' until the last 15% or so there's a really neat climax that leaves you feeling like something did happen. The weird thing is that stuff does happen in the sense that people fight, stormlight is used etc, but it doesn't feel particularly interesting, more like Sanderson was afraid of being boring and decided to throw in some generic action. He does do a good job of edging the plot along, consistintitly if very slowly in each chapter and I think that actually, counter-intuitively makes the problem a bit worse. The book is basically too large for the story being told, but because Sanderson wrote the book big and kept all the parts linked together, it becomes difficult to trim it down. In a sense he's written a very good story, but it would be much better if he had written it several hundred pages shorter, and maybe trimmed out some stuff entirely. Unfortunately though, that's like building a tower and then deciding you used too many bricks, not much you can do about it at that point. It just feels too long and there are stretches where just enough happens to keep the book interesting, but not enough for it to be satisfying and that leaves a book that plods for a long time and gets good at the end. The strength of a long book is that if it's a joy to read you don't want it to end, but here it felt more like a chore, not entirely unpleasant, but most of the time not supremely rewarding either. The one other thing that bugs me is the ending (no spoilers) previous books have an ending that makes you feel like you've taken a step forward, at the end of book 1 Kalidan fianlly earns his freedom and at the end of book 2 they discover the Knights Radiant Fortress, but at the end of Oathbringer I couldn't help thinking... that was it? If anything it feels like they've taken some huge steps back overall even if certain characters have seen a lot of development. I'm still unsure how it really helped things. Jasnah was cool though... as always. Overall, it was a cool book, I don't intend to read it again, because most of it is a slog, but I did enjoy it. That said, I think if Sanderson was willing to be a bit more brief and focused he could have easily had us through the whole 5 book story arc by now, but instead we're 3600 pages in with no end remotely in sight and 4 years to wait for parts 4 and 5. That's frustrating, and I can't help but feel the series is starting to morph into a never ending Wheel of Time spren. Also, there are a lot of freaking spren in this book.

"B01NAWAH85","4","Great book","Don't get me wrong, I really did enjoy this book, but as a couple other people have mentioned, it kinda fell flat. There are a lot of important events happening in the book, but it also didn't seem to flow as well as the previous two. There are much needed character development to two of the important characters, Dalinar and Shallan. -Some spoilers ahead The Dalinar chapters delve into his past in regards to the segments that were removed with the memory of his previous wife. These were good, but sometimes the placement of the flashback chapters seemed out of place, or broke up the flow of the story. Now for Shallan. These were the chapters I was both most impressed with, but ultimately most disappointed with. They started out great, and just kept getting better and better, but they just seemed to abruptly end with a contradiction to what they built towards (I admit some bias, as I shipped it pretty hard). While the explanation given was acceptable, it just seemed to detract from Kaladin's character development, as well as the progression of Shallan and Adolin. I get it, I really do, but it just seemed like an abrupt end to the development. the minor character development also seemed to stall towards the end of the book. These chapters answered a lot of questions from the previous books, but also brought up just as many as were answered: Is that a dragon, what is the significance of the tiny spren from eshonai's body: is it eshonai or an ancestor? What is the importance of that city where all the sailors were drugged and killed at? What's with all the weird not-shardblade-shardblades? While I'm sure some of these will be answered in future books, it just seemed like some of the characters in the interludes weren't pointed at the correct characters. I admit, some were obviously just to introduce future plot points, and thats well and good, but it just seemed kind of lackluster. Another sore point for me was how abruptly the book seemed to end. The last chapters just seemed rushed to get to the end. They seemed to skip over details, and seemed essentially like a summary of a couple weeks. While I understand that this is common enough as a literary device, in a book so full of details, this just seemed bland. Also, Jasnah is very important to several plot developing details, but the books haven't provided any insight into her character. It would have been nice to see more interaction between her and the other characters besides Shallan. In summary, I really enjoyed this book, but a lot of it seemed like filler for the few chapters of major plot points. Lots of questions were answered, but just as many, if not more were raised. Lots of character development took place, Dalinar's was great, Shallan's was great, but seemed to end the opposite way that I hoped it was going (some bias) and to me seemed to detract from other character's development. The end was alright, but seemed kinda dull compared to the rest of the book. Some characters that were important to the plot seemed to be skipped over, but there wasn't necessarily a need to include them, but I would have liked to have their character developed more than other characters.","2017-11-17","United States","","true","31","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYVPKSWHPQQ4Z"
"B01NAWAH85","4","Expansive and immersive yet a little disappointing","This is the third book in a planned series of ten and we are finally getting to the point where, no matter who the reader is, they will not agree with some of the choices that the author has made. For me, this was the least enjoyable of the series so far yet it is still an excellent book and, in terms of plot, it contains the most depth of anything I've read from Sanderson. My main issue is that the author has a habit of pulling his punches during the big scenes and sequences. It's as though he is trying to save the impact for later in the series. After three books of that, you start to become a bit annoyed. Brandon Sanderson's world building and dialogue is top notch but when it comes to depicting scenes of intensity such as action or passion, I think he has room for improvement. The direction that he chooses to take the main characters in will not be a hit with some readers. In general, I really liked what he did with Dalinar but I think that he has really stumbled with Kaladin (probably the most popular character). This book was more focused on Dalinar but I feel that Brandon has allowed his most compelling character (Kaladin) to stagnate a bit. The series has also reached the point where there are so many characters that it can become a chore just to keep everything straight. That said, the amount of back-story and world-building that we get in this book is amazing and he has truly produced a marvelous historical context for these books. The potential for the next books in the series is still extremely high. I also increasingly have a gripe about the way the female characters are portrayed. They are basically invincible and infallible. Jasnah and Shallan have a much easier time of things than Kaladin or Dalinar; who are often embroiled in battles for their life. I first noticed this in Words of Radiance but it's even more pronounced in this book. Sanderson doesn't seem willing to put the female characters through the same trials and tribulations that he puts the males through; essentially making the women always up to whatever task they take on. It makes those characters far less compelling because you know that the author is coddling them. Sanderson has also fallen into the trap of perhaps giving his heroes too much power; thus needing to introduce various deus ex machina in order to create difficulty for them. It's kind of like Superman. Because Superman is so powerful, you tend to see cheesy plot devices like Kryptonite used to create a challenge for him. Kaladin has this happen time and again in this series and it's starting to wear thin. The author conveniently strips him of his powers in order to manufacture drama sometimes. It's getting old fast. If you've read the first two books in this series, you will like this one as well though it's less of a crowd-pleaser.","2018-10-30","United States","","true","32","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWHM70HGG2IPV"

Is anyone surprised? I think Oathbringer has usurped the throne for my 'longest book ever read'. It is actually knocking Words of Radiance out of that chair, which in turn shoved out Way of Kings. Somehow these books keep getting longer, and yet they remain as satisfying as ever. Sanderson is a masterful plotter, and the Stormlight Archive is hard evidence of that. He weaves a complex tale through five Parts, each part ending with its own reveals and excitement, leading to an all-out, adrenaline pumping sprint through Part Five. The famed Sanderson Avalanche. It's hard to finish a book of his and not be absolutely spinning from the experience. Now, Brandon isn't without his flaws; he is not infallible. On occasion he makes strange (sometimes awkward) dialogue choices, and every now and then he tells, rather than shows. But damn it if his strengths don't far outweigh his weaknesses. Everything we readers have grown to love about The Stormlight Archive (and the Cosmere at large - Stormlight always has more Cosmere crossover than his other works, and that remains true) is on display here in Oathbringer. The book is full of definitive, epic moments. The sort of scenes you talk about with your friends as you finish the book because you couldn't help but pump your fist in excitement. Our favorite characters all return; to grow, and learn, and face their demons, and questions their own morals. Cosmere mysteries are unveiled, offering sweet, sweet answers to questions long asked; whether this comes from a tidbit of information in an epigraph, the appearance of a mysterious new character, or from the mouth of a god.. it is oh so satisfying. And in true Sanderson fashion, questions answered lead to questions asked. There is always another secret. As usual the book itself is beautiful. Brandon has commissioned artists to create in-universe drawings; from Shallan's sketchbooks, maps, paintings of the Heralds, and much more. It adds to the experience in a huge way, and alters one's view of this series from merely a book to a full-on piece of art. These are the type of books I read electronically for convenience and then buy again physically to show them off. At the risk of going off the rails with my praise I'll wrap it up. Another five stars for The Stormlight Archive, and another long wait ahead. One that I know Brandon will fill with other worthwhile stories as we all theorize and eagerly await our return to Roshar.","2017-11-28","United States","","true","34","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSZN6XBDDC6F9"
"B01NAWAH85","2","Too Many Toys in the Pool","ASoIaF has ruined everything. It's the standard with how epic series are judged nowadays and it's simply not fair. Martin has talked a bit about how he's writing to deviate from traditional clichés, to show that characters and stories don't have to be black or white, but an ever evolving hue of grays. It's all done masterfully and you find yourself swimming in imagination, caring about the characters, wondering about the world and wanting so much more. I haven't pinpointed the way Sanderson does it, but I keep turning the page despite the now generic way in which fills the pool with so much stuff that there's little room for imagination. First, Oathbringer, like its predecessors, is bloated. It is easily 700 pages too long. The same themes and routines are beaten into the ground and it's painful. Has every character turned into Perrin, where it's the same non-evolution that is simply hard to tolerate? Are sub-plots and arcs starting to repeat themselves just with different characters or locations like Goodkind? Drizzt didn't have the level of endless, boring mental anguish, described ad-nauseam, as what is exposed with the main characters here. Sanderson's writing is becoming very predictable in this manner. Second, in another predictable aspect, there are simply too many systems and it's hard to take them seriously anymore, much less keep up with them. Mistborn was such a breath of fresh air, with the creative idea of ingesting metals. At first there were something like 7 or 8 metals that made up the story and it was great, we focused on the story and characters. Then there was 1 more super-secret-double-probation-all-powerful-metal that solved a pain point. Oh, here's a couple more that do new and plot solving things. In the end it felt like there were 40+ metals and every time something came up in the story, a new metal was introduced. It was clever at first, and then it just seemed abused and hard to take seriously within the context of the story. The same thing is happening in the Stormlight Archives only at a ridiculously epic level. There are Radiants, Sprens, Voidbringers, Unmade, parallel worlds, Gods, Diagrammers, Fused, Ghostbloods, harmonies, swords, Bindings, Heralds, Wit & Azure, gems, fabrials, castings, the list goes on and on. Everywhere you turn, another system is hitting you over the head with a new addition to the system that gives great and wonderful powers. It's to the point of being comical when a system is described as having 3 entities and you have to sigh and say 'well, that will be 9 or 10 pretty quickly' and sure enough the foreshadowing is dropped and a couple of hundred pages later a new one is introduced. There is very little room for imagination as everything is charted out and neatly arranged with additions coming at you fast and furious. Sometimes it feels more like reading the Periodic Table than an epic fantasy series. Finally, and this probably a sum of the first two points, the characterization is simply not good. It's hard to care less about the characters now. Going back to idea of evolving hue of grays by Martin, Sanderson seems to have 3 colors he's willing to play with, a black, a white and a gray. All of the characters fit in one or the other with some jumping back and forth between two with some pretty comical plot devices. It's hard to care about Kaladin anymore as we've spent nearly 4,000 pages of him being the exact same character. There is absolutely nothing dynamic about the character. In fact, they're all like that. Shallan, Dalinar, Adolin, Szeth, Jasnah are all the exact same characters as when they were introduced, with lots of pages of repetitive mental anguish experienced by all and more of the same to come. Indeed, we're now seemingly getting more of the same with doppelganger Kaladin (if this really happens, shame on Sanderson) and more angst players. The characters are so flat that it's sad in how often you'll find yourself reading on just to see when Sanderson will fall into predictable habits. Where's that comic relief that is awesome and so out of feel with the world? Oh, there's Lift! Where's another mysterious flat character that forms a base for another system to play with? Oh, there's Azure! Where are the lines of comedy that are so awkward and out of place that you can only assume they're in jokes with Sanderson's editors/proofreaders? Oh, they're abundant and grimace inducing every time. When will he hit Caps Lock and go comic book bad guy on us? IT’S EYE-ROLL WORTHY! Poor Demandred. With all of that said, I still find myself purchasing the books and turning the page and I don't know why. That seems to be my main driver now, pinpointing why. I believe it’s 3 more books in this arc, a break and then 6 more? Sanderson said he didn't want to fall into the clichés of epic fantasy in some interview somewhere, yet he's doing it in all new ways. He has such a wonderful imagination and the world is rich in many aspects. Wild Cards started 20+ years ago and you can see the evolution of how some of the authors there have evolved their craft. With the rate at which Sanderson is writing, there's hope he can turn the corner, back off the emphasis of the world formulas he's developed and focus on the characters, crafting a story that gives your imagination some room to roam on its own.","2017-12-06","United States","","true","35","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21P44SQTRQOA0"
"B01NAWAH85","5","10/10 if you've been digging into the Cosmere, 5/10 if you haven't","In reading a lot of other reviews, I think I've noticed what might be an unmentioned dividing point that will determine whether you'll love this book or be bored to tears by it. If you've been trying to connect the hints that tie Mistborn, Warbreaker, Elantris, and Stormlight all together, this book will grip you. If you've read Arcanum Unbounded, this book will fascinate you. If you've been going back and trying to find where Hoid shows up, where worlds have similarities to each other (Mistborn: Hidden History, for example, spends a huge chunk of time in place that's their equivalent of Shadesmar, but you won't really appreciate it for what it actually means until you read Oathbringer), where characters have interacted with other worlds (this book reveals that Odium had killed the Shards that controlled the Magic in Elantris and set the stage for the events in that novel, as well as a few passing references to Mistborn's Harmony and how insanely powerful he's become). There are tons of juicy hints into the backstory of the Shattering, revelations about the underpinnings of ALL the different magic systems in the Cosmere, subtle references to events in other books (and appearances by not one but three characters from Warbreaker -- one is really obvious, one isn't too hard to figure out, and the third takes a bit of digging), and huge insights into who Hoid/Wit really is and what he's up to. Oathbringer isn't just setting up events for the next Stormlight book, but it's setting hooks into some sort of greater event/conflict that will span the Cosmere as a whole. Brandon's destination with his Cosmere series has always been a sort of equivalent to Avengers: Endgame, where all his worlds and characters and systems come together. When you approach Oathbringer with that perspective, it gets a WHOLE lot more interesting. A lot of what is boring and potentially unnecessary in Oathbringer is actually a rich dive into the glue that binds the entire Cosmere together, and it shows off just how brilliant Sanderson is. He's structured his giant Cosmere arc very carefully and this book shows it better than any other. However...if you haven't been making those connections and trying to figure those things out, this book is going to feel like a ton of padding surrounding roughly 200 pages of actual plot. There are a lot of slow moments as well, I'll grant you, but for me those experiences were outweighed by the juicy tidbits and revelations into the universe that Sanderson has spent the better part of nearly two decades crafting.

"B01NAWAH85","4","Oathbringer Continues to Build on a Structurally Remarkable Series","I will keep this short, because if you have been looking for Oathbringer review, surely you have found one or…1,998 reviews to read first. Oathbringer isn’t my favorite Stormlight book, but, structurally-speaking, the series remains remarkable. The hugely ambitious epic continues to feature multiple storylines that are satisfying at the volume level but that build as the series progress, and Sanderson has continue to lay on new twists and a truly impressive amount of worldbuilding. Oathbringer is heavily driven by the events at the end of Words of Radiance, primarily the implications of Sadeas’ death and the coming of the Everstorm and the awakening of the parshmen. Sanderson is sticking to each volume devoting considerable page space to flashbacks for a single character. This volume it is Dalinar. I remain deeply skeptical of flashbacks, but Dalinar’s flashbacks really grew on me. They show us a very different side of a character we thought we knew, explain a lot of what is happening in the book, and, along with Dalinar’s present day storyline, build to his storyline’s climax. Perhaps it is a symptom of reading too many of those slim 1970s paperbacks, or of trying to read too many other books at the same time, but Oathbringer dragged for me, especially in the first half. The worldbuildling is great, but there is so much of it, and so much is so weird that it sometimes slides right off the brain. Epic fantasy rewards close reading, rereading, and whiling away hours on Internet forums. And, to really appreciate the Stormlight Archive, you have to appreciate Sanderson’s Cosmere, which requires reading a bunch of other Sanderson books. I am finally getting to the point where I’m getting compound gains from Cosmere books, but I am not really in the right head space for epic fantasy right now (and if the Wheel of Time TV show gets off the ground, the Cosmere is getting chucked right out so my epic fantasy brain cells can focus on more important things). The worldbuilding can be a challenge, but it really is worth it. We learn way, way more about Shadesmar, as well as Odium and Cultivation. The Unmade are introduced, sort of evil superspren. The worldbuilding involving the Parshendi is very, very cool. In addition to a slow start that is of dubious utility to the second half of the book and the climax, I hated Shallan’s growing “split” personality. Oathbringer has maybe my least favorite Stormlight Archive cover, although The Way of Kings wins by a mile regardless (I have a huge print of The Way of Kings artwork hanging in my home office).","2018-08-14","United States","","true","38","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14B81OIJNNCE7"
"B01NAWAH85","5","that Brandon is my favorite author ever","As a caveat, I do have to state up front, that Brandon is my favorite author ever. So this review is tainted by someone who praises his work almost daily to anyone I can, hopefully convincing them to get as much enjoyment and happiness from reading him as I do. Having said that, as some one who’s read all of his work, I feel I can give an accurate assessment of this book. This is his best work yet. By far. You can tell reading through his books in the cosmere that his writing grows better and better. (Compare this to say Elantris) As one would expect with more experience and know how. He truly has become a master and is the RJ/Tolkien of this generation. No one compares to Brandon right now. This book itself is all encompassing in its swath of emotion and direction. There is so much, I mean heck this book is longer than the entire LoTR combined (the trilogy) but it doesn’t feel like it. I’ve read through it three times and am currently half way through listening to it (if you like audiobooks better GET IT. Truly fantastic) and I never get bored. I am hooked over and over again and can not put it down. It may seem daunting for how big and long it is. But you will find that by the end there’s not enough. This book will make you crave more and will only sink the hook that is the cosmere deeper into you. Even if you don’t read all the other cosmere books and go hunting for clues like us freak do, this book will amaze you. Brandon just has a knack for story telling and world building. Do you self a favor and get this book, especially if you read the previous two. The only negatives I’ve reall seen or heard about these books are some of the idiotic decisions or beliefs the characters have. As they are just so stubbornly depressing, especially to fantasy readers, where character growth happens so fast. If you understand that these characters are broken, Completely through, it may help soften your anger. And realizing that we still have 7more books in the SA alone so there will plenty of time for growth (remember perin took like 6 books to become non frustrating again in Wot) Once again buy this book!

"B01NAWAH85","5","Another exciting, albeit padded, entry","Oathbringer expands things in numerous ways. More perspectives, more places, more characters, and so on. I'll admit to struggling with this book. Maybe it was mood related, maybe it was burn out, but I took a long time to read it, and I feel like it should have been 800 pages at most, which wouldn't have lost you anything. That said, when accompanying a relative to the ER and being stuck there for 6 hours, I couldn't put it down during the climax. The climax is incredible as readers have come to expect from Sanderson and makes the whole thing worth it. After struggling with this one I am a bit wary about Rhythm of War, but my Cosmere journey finally has an end in sight, even if I doubt that I'll make the Secret Projects before Wind and Truth comes out.

"B01NAWAH85","4","Easily 4.5+ Stars","I personally define a 5-star score as being near perfection, so I feel bad about rounding down the 4.5 (more like 4.75) to 4 stars. For what it's worth, Way of Kings and Words of Radiance are the only fiction books on my 5-star list. Oathbringer was outstanding and serves as a continued example that Brandon Sanderson is the undisputed king of the Fantasy genre. It's impractical to attempt discussing the merits of the book; there are too many - so I'll take the obnoxious route and focus on the few negatives. The first signal that this book was inferior to the first two struck me when I found myself taking breaks without feeling that magnetic pull that caused me to pause my life in order to read WOK and WOR (which even persisted in my 3rd reading of both books in the weeks prior to the Oathbringer release!). My main gripe was with the diminished focus on Kaladin. For me, WOK set the expectation that he was THE hero. I understand that it's unrealistic to expect him to be the lead protagonist in an epic fantasy of this scope - even so, Kaladin deserved more attention. Ideally, Kaladin would be at least be the co-lead protagonist or a very close second (I felt this was done successfully in WOR). Let's bring him back to the limelight in Book 4! Next. I was somewhat disappointed with the direction being taken in the Interludes. In WOK, they featured these completely unknown people on bizarre adventures in far off lands; I loved the mystery, knowing that each would eventually tie into the central plot. So my expectation was set: the interludes were obscure pieces of a growing puzzle - and it's very exciting now that they're appearing bit by bit. However, WOR started showing us characters who are already part of the main story, and this trend only increased in Oathbringer. To me, the primary purpose of the Interludes isn't being fulfilled. Finally, I found the added focus on supporting characters to be bothersome. For example, I really like Teft as the complicated, yet likable semi-one dimensional bridgeman from WOK and WOR, but his development in Oathbringer lost my interest, especially because every word about these lesser characters was one less devoted to my favorites. In a perfect world, Brandon would write Edgedancer-like novellas on literally every minor character in the series, from Rock to Mraize to Aesudan! All in all: Brandon is hands-down the best and, despite the minor flaws, Oathbringer was wonderful and I can't wait to continue this fascinating journey before reaching that inevitable, but necessary destination.","2017-11-18","United States","","true","41","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OKT0ZCL598U4"
"B01NAWAH85","5","Finale-quality in a mid-series book","Oathbringer is, in a word, epic. So much happens in this book, with so many plots interweaving, especially toward the end, that it’s like 5 intense movies vying for your attention at the same time. There’s so much, in fact, that it read like a series finale rather than a mid-series novel. It wasn’t until after I finished the book that I discovered it wasn’t the finale! Reiterating what others have suggested, I recommend reading the Edgedancer novella before picking this one up. It’s a short read (by comparison) and gives more color to 3 characters who don’t get nearly enough screen time in this book, especially Lift, and will make those chapters more enjoyable. Oathbringer picks up where Words of Radiance / Edgedancer left off. It follows the same format as the first 2, broken in 3 parts with interludes from random character perspectives. The interludes were easier to relate to the main plot than previous books and felt more relevant, which was refreshing. The story follows the same characters from previous books: Dalinar, Kaladin, Shallan, Adolin, and to a lesser extent Szeth. Each has a unique character arc and struggles, which are satisfactorily advanced, while leaving plenty of questions about where and how they’ll end up. Thanks to the Oathgates, we also get to see a few new settings. Urithiru, the mysterious tower above the storm, is explored in more detail. Shadesmar and its strange spren inhabitants become first-class citizens. Queen Fen’s Thaylen City is the stage for an epic battle. Kholinar, Dalinar’s home city, is besieged and explored from within by a daring rescue party. We also learn more about what life was like in Alethkar before and after Gavilar’s reign via a detailed dive through the Blackthorn’s sordid history, also giving color to his reputation and deepening our understanding of his conflict, and what the Nightwatcher did to him. As with many epics, this book suffers from the occasional slowdown or (seemingly) irrelevant history when, really, you just want to know what happens next, but his skillful setup pays off in the end with a dazzling if overwhelming weaving of plot and action that kept me turning the pages, and for me was well worth the investment. The ending itself was a bit confusing and left me unsatisfied, unfortunately, but the events leading up to it were so spectacular that it’s a very minor gripe. I don’t give 5-star ratings often, but in this case, Mr. Sanderson has earned it.","2019-03-15","United States","","true","42","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKIXMS3LS6Q4U"

"B01NAWAH85","5","Continuation of awesomness","This book continues and expands upon Way of Kings and Words of Radiance. If you like those books, you'll continue to enjoy Oathbringer. That is not to say that everything is linear and predictable, but the sense of wonder, the detailed characters and world building continue. The scope continues to enlarge: WOK was rather narrow and focused on the a few characters, WOR expanded to a nation, and OB encompasses all of Roshar. I missed some of the detailed focus on the journey of a few characters in a limited region, but definitely enjoyed the swelling cast and their interactions. We meet more Queens and Emperors, Knight Radiants and Odium's Fused. The pacing of the first half of the book was mild, but very enjoyable --- I like ebb and flow, not everything can be at max speed at all times. Many things were set up that all had great pay-off at the end, as well as much more information about the final desolation, the recreance, the unmade, the heralds, Odium, Cultivation, and Honor. And then we get to the last 1/3 of the book. The pace picks up dramatically, and all sorts of awesome excitement and realm bending events occur. The one thing that I did not like as much was the focus on Shallan. She's never been my favorite character, and I felt like her conflict was a bit weird and not very relatable -- I enjoyed her most in WOK and WOR. This is not to say it was bad, just not my favorite part. I thought Kaladin had less page time then in the previous 2 books, and I missed him. Dalinar's journey was detailed, and very fulfilling. I do worry with the growing character list, that some of the tight focus on a a few characters and their growth may get lost. However, that hasn't happened yet, I trust Sanderson will handle it well, and so far he has. All and all, a very exciting book that continues to move the series along in dynamic and unexpected, yet satisfying ways. There is no dragging on of mysteries -- many things are reveled that I thought might be kept hidden for a while, as well as raising many new and interesting questions. There is no let down or slow down, this is a phenomenal addition to the series.","2017-11-26","United States","","true","46","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR6R5LWOMX4F1"

"B01NAWAH85","3","Interesting...","I liked the first two books the best. I would say this book was still good but lacking in some ways. I felt lost most of the time i coulnt tell where everything was headed. It felt like there where good bits and pieces of story and character building but it didn't start making any sense until way way late in the book. Also I think lots of scenes could definitely be cut and condensed and no one would miss them. I Felt bothered by every person having a deep unhealthy emotional issue. Nearly all the main characters other than Kaladin were dealing with the guilt of murdering someone. That felt heavy and a bit overdone. I was also bothered that Shallan was obviously feeling attraction for Kaladin, enough that Adalin was trying to take a healthy step back for her to figure out her feelings. Instead of working through those emotions, Shallan just abruptly decides to ignore that attraction and make a rash decision to keep Adolin, made most likely out of the fear of messing up the relationship. I wished she had been given time to decide her own mind in the next book. Is Adolin a good choice for her? Yeah probably, but it felt abrupt to me the way it happened. She will have to suppress those feeling now which again is unhealthy. Its either suppress those feelings, or Brandon will have to completely ignore that anything happened remotely between them, so that Shallan can stay true to Adolin. It's awkward. I also had a hard time with the talk of ""mating"" and intamacy, etc. I would feel a little uncomfortable recommending this book mostly because of that. Nothing super explicit, but enough to make it uncomfortable. Good things I liked, I felt like the world building was good, the plot is unique and the Characters interesting and individual. Brandon does have a way of making you love the people he creates with all of their flaws. There were also some good values taught in the book, like the importance of owning our mistakes, and realizing that life is a step by step process of change. I appreciated how the difference between those who stayed good, and those who chose evil involved the choice of owning their own mistakes or not. I liked the scene with Shallan and Wit I felt like that was beautiful scene. Including the story of the wall. I liked how the book ended, there was some epic moments that were powerful in their own way. I kind of wonder if I will continue reading the next couple of books. I feel like it's a lot of book each time, and I am not sure I am that invested this story and these people. It's been a good entertaining series but I don't feel deeply drawn in to see what happens next to be honest. We will see I may change my mind.","2022-04-26","United States","","true","49","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKHADZIJDQTJO"
"B01NAWAH85","5","Exceptional again","Oathbringer is the third major book in Brandon Sanderson’s “Stormlight Archive” series. I believe the series is planned for ten volumes with a new book every two or three years. In addition to the primary books, there has also been one novella released as part of the series called “Edgedancer”. While the novellas may not be completely necessary to read and understand the overall series, Edgedancer certainly provided further insight into the character of Lift – which in turn made her more enjoyable in Oathbringer. So if you’ve not read Edgedancer yet, I would recommend you do that before diving off into Oathbringer. As with the other two main books of the series, Oathbringer is a monster of a book. This one comes in at 1248 pages and is the longest of the first three books. It continues the story from the first two books. As with the others, the main narrative is interrupted from time to time with flashbacks and interludes. Sanderson uses the flashbacks to give us answers to questions and to further develop character’s back stories. The interludes are short chapters that provide glimpses into character’s perspectives that aren’t necessarily in the primary group of main characters – at least not yet. As I’ve talked about before regarding this series, it’s not called “epic fantasy” for no reason. The size and scope of this series is tremendous. The world is completely immersive, the language perfectly executed, and the characters fully realized. Sanderson is the master of this genre for a reason. All three of the first books in this Stormlight Archive stand as a testament to his ability to create something that completely exceeds expectations. I have no doubt that once this series is finally complete, it will go down as one of the most important stories in the history of fantasy fiction. This book is on par with the first two – meaning it’s incredible. Even with such a long list of extremely talented authors writing in the fantasy genre, Sanderson continues to prove that he is the best there is. Time will tell, but he might be the best ever.","2018-02-28","United States","","true","50","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2STAO0FKLMDKT"

"B01NAWAH85","5","Epic story that moves quickly with fun and engaging characters. One of the best fantasy stories written.","Sanderson hits another homer with this, the third book in the Starlight Archive. This book centers more around Dalinar and his quest to ""Unite them"". There are some serious twists in this part of the story that really settle some of the questions that the earlier books bring out. Not all questions are answered, by far, but the answers provided are satisfying and do lead to more, even bigger questions. It keeps things engaging and interesting. The major characters are Dalinar, Shallan, and Kaladin still. This book doesn't suffer from Kaladin's floundering like the previous book -- not that it had a major impact in Words Of Radiance -- but it was a bit annoying. Sanderson seems to have found better ways of dealing with the internal conflicts in characters so it's more natural and less painful for the all-knowing reader to read. I won't go into the storyline, but I will say that all the characters progress satisfactorily. The story moves along at a very good clip, which is amazing considering how long the book is. There is one section that gets a little slow and I am still unsure why it was needed the way it was, but there's always certain things that are going to be a bit slow. Overall, the story and plot makes big strides in this book. It's not like a George RR book where he makes some advances, then takes it all back at the end of the book, The ending is fairly epic and moves along at a very rapid-fire rate. This apex is almost as long as some other authors complete books. Sanderson simply keeps getting better and better. He is, in my opinion, the best fantasy writer on the market today. Nobody else can touch the epic nature of his stories and nobody else has even close to the level of world building that he has save for Steven Erickson in the Book of the Fallen series. Get this series and read it. If you like fantasy, you will love this series. It's super long and for me, that is a good thing. It's deeply engaging and allows you to totally immerse yourself in the world and the story.","2018-04-03","United States","","true","52","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAB0VUQ5HDGDN"

As story after story within story unwinds you constantly find yourself reassessing prior conclusions, unplugging from previous expectations.

"B01NAWAH85","5","Rise, fall, and redemption of Dalinar Kholin","So, let me start this off by saying that this book doesn’t deserve to be rated as a 5. It’s probably at best a 4. Let me explain why I wanted to give it the five. I’m partial to Dalinar Kholin because I just think he is a great character and across the last three books you get to know him. This book focuses on him in the flashbacks, and I found that kept me reading. I wanted to know his story. It wasn’t like the Words of Radiance where I trudged through Shallan’s back story, I think she is just okay, and came to respect her because of it. Dalinar, I honestly feel drawn to because of his story and the redemptive arc he goes through in this book. In true Brandon Sanderson fashion, we get what I like to call the “Sandolanche”. You are reading 1242 pages man. There are some slow parts that I struggled to get through and didn’t really advance the plot but were a task the characters had to get through because they had gotten themselves into trouble. Other than having that section to show how they get to the stage for the final battle you don’t get a whole lot other than snippets of backstory or world building. Then the Sandolanche, or avalanche of reveals, action, deaths, and battles in the last 250 pages. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it I guess. I have read a few of Mr. Sanderson’s books now. Whether it is a 600 page book or a 1200 page book that formula seems to hold true in the appropriate ratio depending the book’s length in its entirety. Are there parts of the book that are slow and tough to get through, you bet yah, but I really appreciated the lesson I learned from Dalinar. Journey before destination. We go through life causing hurt and destruction, but we can choose to get up and be a better person if we accept the things we have done and keep trying despite our failures. I needed to be reminded of that lesson, thus the 5 even though this book might not have been deserving.","2017-12-19","United States","","true","56","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31E4UE50YTQOB"
"B01NAWAH85","5","Journey Before Destination!","Brandon Sanderson's third installment in the Stormlight Archive is a massive tome full of stay up all night long page-turning fantasy. I've written a lot of book reviews before but how do I review one of my favorite works by one of my favorite authors objectively? Well, the answer for me is, don't. This book has feels, I found myself crying or cheering or both simultaneously throughout the experience. I could tell you about Kaladin and his struggle to balance his heart with his duty, or Dalinar's struggle to overcome his personal demons and his duty to fill the role of a long-dead god, or maybe Shallan's struggle against her own self-worth. I don't think any of those singly will describe Oathbringer. This book is most definitely about struggle, about our weakness as humans. It exposes our hypocrisy in the face of creatures that mirror ourselves on the inside but appear different on the outside. What I really think this book is about though is showing the inner light of humanity, it shows how hope in the face of darkness shines bright. It teaches us to put others before ourselves. One of the book's best moments comes with the declaration, what is the most important step a man can take? The next step. A simple but powerful message delivered with expert writing the way only Brandon can do. I've taken the lessons from these books and applied them to my life. Taking things one step at a time, learning to appreciate the journey before the destination, learning to speak up for people who don't have a voice. These are all lessons I've taken from Brandon's books and I'm honestly grateful that these books exist. If you're a fan of fantasy and you don't know about Stormlight Archive or Brandon Sanderson then I highly recommend you pick up a copy of the Mistborn Trilogy or Elantris or The Way of Kings to get yourself started.","2020-12-08","United States","","true","57","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QVMNENXERY8U"
"B01NAWAH85","5","Deep Personal Impact","I read Oathbringer when it was first published and then read it a few weeks ago so that I could come into ""Rythm of War"" with a proper context. With several years passing between readings, it almost like reading a new book. In the intervening time, I have been struggling with severe depression and, perhaps in that context, I found this particular piece very insightful regarding mental illness. I found myself taking notes and extracting meaningful quotes that hit me particularly hard. Here are some examples: ""You're not a monster, Shallan,"" Wit whisphered. ""Oh, child, the world is monstrous at times, and there are those who would have you believe that you are terrible by association."" ""I am."" ""No. For you see, it flows in either direction. You are not the worse for your association with the world, but it is better for its association with you."" Here's another one that left me in tears: Dalinar sneered at the god. ""If I pretend that I didn't do these things, it means that I can't have grown to become someone else."" ""A failure."" Something stirred inside of Dalinar. A warmth that he had known once before. A warm, calming light. Unite Them. ""Journey before Destination,"" Dalinar said. ""It cannot be a journey if it doesn't have a beginning."" A thunderclap sounded in his mind. Suddenly, awareness poured back into him. The Stormfather, distant, feeling frightened - but also surprised. Dalinar? ""I take responsibility for what I have done,"" Dalinar whispered. ""If I must fall, I will rise each time a better man."" At a time in my life when I am feeling overwhelmed and hopeless, vignettes like these struck like lightning and I realised that there is far more to this series than a simple work of fiction and I was immensely grateful to an author who could so beautifully capture the things I have felt with empathy.","2020-12-31","United States","","true","58","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R4I3WEDBE9H6"
"B01NAWAH85","5","My Favorite Thus Far","So much happens in this book. Each of the main characters experience so much growth as characters...it’s simply fantastic. In particular, even though this was “Dalinar’s book”, I thought Shallan was the star of the show. She really comes into her own in this book. No longer is she the annoying, insecure pseudo-academic trying to please Jasnah. She’s become a multi-dimensional character—quite literally—with a depth only hinted at in the two previous books. Sanderson explains exactly what’s up with Dalinar’s first wife.and though the contours of that story were predictable, how it fits into the story is amazing. Kaladin is on the back burner in this book but Sanderson does it in a great way. I hope he continues to work in the main characters we all love into the story even though it’s not their POV. For instance, we learn a lot more about Teft & Rock, but Kaladin isn’t totally absent from their storylines. We still get a jolt of Kaladin here & there and then more towards the end. Quite unlike Jordan’s books where you’d only see Rand at the beginning and end of Perrin or Mat’s book— if that makes sense. Anyway, lots of questions answered, a lot more left hanging. We get more of Hoid/Wit who I simply find fascinating. And we get a lot of the backstory behind the Voidbringers. Last third of the book is typical Sanderson. Fast paced action sequences. Overall for a 1200 page book, I thought the pacing was on point because Sanderson is tying off plot points, exploring others, & developing characters. My only gripe is I now have to wait for the next installment! This three year span between books is pushing it for a 10 book series, though I think I read somewhere that it’ll be broken down into 2arcs with five books a piece. I don’t know if that’s true but we’re still talking decades before this thing is completely finished. Luckily, Sanderson is a prolific writer who keeps his fans appraised via status updates. Anyway, fantastic book.","2017-11-18","United States","","true","59","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1H1AEIMNK4CD8"
"B01NAWAH85","4","Great read, some pacing problems, but well worth it -- NO SPOILERS","Let it be known that I am a HUGE fan of Brandon Sanderson's novels. The worlds he creates are unique and engaging, and he is very talented at fleshing out the personalities of his characters. I will do my best to review Oathbringer with no spoilers. Overall, I really enjoyed Oathbringer. Given that Sanderson has said his Stormlight Archive will comprise two five-book arcs, I thought Oathbringer overall does an excellent job of moving the overall plot of the central Voidbringers vs. humans conflict. There are really cool revelations about Shadesmar, spren, the different cultures on Roshar, previous Desolations, and the Heralds. It primarily focuses on Dalinar and secondarily on Shallan. Dalinar's character development, revelations about his past, and his progression as a Knight Radiant were AWESOME. I felt that the character development of other characters suffered, though, despite the book's length. Shallan not being comfortable in her own skin and being afraid of her past and herself was belabored, and the pseudo-resolution seemed rushed. Kaladin's character development stagnated. His obsession with not being able to protect people and worrying that he'll fail everyone are becoming a tired trope. I hope he gets past this early in the next book. There was NOT enough Jasnah or Renarin. These are some of the MOST intriguing characters in the book, and we still know little about them three whole books in!! I am curious to learn more about Wit, but I get the sense we will learn more in future books.... That was a bit disappointing. The pacing of the book was very slow in the beginning. Book 1 dragged for a while. Book 2 dragged less, and by Book 3-5 the action was pretty even. I think what likely is happening is that the pacing of the book is struggling a bit under the weight of its own epic-ness, which is not uncommon in long epic fantasy series. However, the first 22% of the book was a little more of a dialogue slog. The ending, though, WAS AWESOME. Really, like all of Book 5 was great.","2018-01-03","United States","","true","60","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IBWXE4JWF8Y1"

"B01NAWAH85","4","Avid fan with some mixed emotions","After having read this book, I needed to let it sit for a couple of days before attempting to write a review. It was just so much! On the one hand I must say that I loved this book. I preordered it months and months ago, and felt like a child at Christmas when it was finally delivered to my phone. Sleeping, working and basically doing anything other than just reading became a bother. Still, having finished I have some mixed feelings. Although we really had some nice plot and character developments it did not quite measure up. In a way a lot of it seemed a bit shallow (don’t kill me) for instance kaladin was a bit forgotten in this book, he was almost degraded to a side character. Shallan had some interesting reveals at the end of last book, but we did not really get a continuation on that, and her development through the book also seemed not quite enough. On the other hand Dalinar was nicely fleshed out, and became more nuanced, but at the same time I was not that lost in his story. You also had a lot of chapters dedicated to side character, and although adding to the overall plot, failed to drag me in. In a way this book might serve as a filler book, starting several threads that will become important in later books. It is supposed to be a 10? Piece series, so I definitely see the need. I also don't quite know how to feel about the crossover from the book warbreaker, since they have different magic systems, and I generally like my books to stay separate. I will not say anything more of that since I don't do spoilers. That said, this is still one of my favorite series at the time being, and I’m a dedicated fan that will definitely continue reading. Even if there was in my opinion some flaws, the level of writing and storytelling is FAR above most other fantasy currently on the market. Also the ending was quite satisfying so thumbs up for that!","2017-11-21","United States","","true","63","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22NSVRO5MZ5TH"

"B01NAWAH85","4","SKIM READERS ONLY!!!!!","You better be an excellent skim reader to read this book. It is almost unreadable for the first 40%. Just enough hints here and there that you try to gut it out and keep reading. I put this down time and again and I am a huge sanderson fan. I reread the first two books in this series in anticipation. I still almost stopped reading it 20 times in the first 40%. Grit your teeth and skim read as fast as you can. Then just when you are ready to pull your fingernails off Sanderson puts in 3 or 4 chapters that are so good and so interesting you HAVE to keep reading. And that will get you through then next 20% and then a couple more. Then when you are ready to shelve the book for good again, you reach the final 10% and it's so good you forget how unbelievably bad it was for huge sections of the book. So how can it have a 4 star review? The same reason most give it a 5 star review. The great outweighs the terrible. Bottom line is about 40% of the book should be rated 1 star. It's that bad. Huge chunks should have been edited out. Another 20% is 2 star and another 20% is 3 star. But the remaining 20% is 10 Star on a scale from 1 to 5. It's that good. So in the end I give it a 4 star overall because the good is that good. It hurts to give it a 4 star when you know you are subjecting readers to huge chunks of completely meaningless and irrelevant text. I feel terrible about recommending this to anyone who can't read fast. They might hurt themselves trying to get through the bad parts. But the good makes it worth it.","2018-01-26","United States","","true","65","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L58HNLEPL5TX"
"B01NAWAH85","5","Another Great Chapter in the Series","Loved the first two books. The writing style and the overall theme were right up my alley. Went back and read through some important parts in those two books to get myself ready for this edition, and very glad I did. I would not have connected some of the 'moments' in this new book without that. Would highly recommend you do the same I was worried by the initial reviews stating that there was a lot of talk with very little action, and worried even more that people said Kaladin (my favorite character) was taking a backstage to Shallan (a character I did not really care for in either of the previous books). I tend to get bored easily and during heavy talk engagements I tend to unconsciously skim the passages. I am happy to say this was not the case here! Yes, there are a lot of parts that revolve around talking and building the coalition, but I never once felt the book lagging or being bogged down by it. They were long passages, but they were also necessary passages with very little fat on them. The only time I felt some lag was around the 92% mark which was right before the amazing finale so that was fine. Kaladin does take a back seat, but Shallan is a lot less...annoying (maybe not the right word) in this book. I liked her character arc a lot. While I wish Kaladin was in it more, hes definitely not a side character, and has many chapters devoted solely to him. So if you are like me, don't worry. Finally the best part of this book: It answers a lot of questions that you have from the previous books. I wont spoil anything, but its a giant leap forward in the reader knowledge of the world but leaves just enough questions for the next book. Overall a great read.","2017-12-14","United States","","true","66","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OQTUDKOGYFF8"
"B01NAWAH85","5","My opinion of all three books so far.","I cannot express how much I love these books, these characters (mostly), and this world. I have loved Brandon Sanderson since I first read him when he finished Wheel of Time, and I have read almost everything that he has written, including some articles that he has written on the writing process. ""Imperil Them!"" (That is a quote from one of his stories about his writing teacher, but I digress.) These books are incredibly well written. They are fairly long, but with little to no ""filler"" or parts that are just difficult to get through. He has created a story that keeps you entertained throughout the entire process, and even during side chapters when you can't figure out what the point is at the time, it usually comes back around to the point later in the story. (Except for the part with the guys in the Purelake in the first book, I still can't make that connection although I am probably just missing it.) I love almost all of the characters in this story. He has built a world where you really care about them and want them to do well. *Slight Kinda Spoiler* Kaladin beating himself up all of the time can get a little tiring at times, but it does make sense for him to feel that way, I just want him to get over it already. It's been three books. Also, I cannot express how much I hate Shallan. If there was one character in this book I could do without, it would be her. She has her place in the story and it is an important place, but she drives me insane. The incessant complaining is not fun to read. Now that I have read these book a few times, I usually just skip her chapters.","2020-06-26","United States","","true","67","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2N2IM1BILAGYV"
"B01NAWAH85","4","A Little Disappointed","** spoiler alert ** So, I had so many mixed feelings about this book. I'll talk about what I didn't like about the book, first. Too much touching between couples. This book just got too detailed with intimacy. I wouldn't let younger children read it because of that. Had more language, too, and spoke a lot of people making crude gestures. Even Shallan seemed less feminine through out the book, becoming vulgar at times. Another thing that bothered me was how Drehy was courting a man. It was so subtle... yet not. I didn't mind so much that he was gay as I did Kaladin's response about it. Kaladin is the epitome of what is right, what is honorable. Yet this didn't phase him, he felt it was wrong to judge. So, all that in the beginning of the book made me wonder if I would be done reading Sanderson's future books. I was kinda disappointed ;/ Now to what I love about the book... It certainly took a turn for the better :) All parts with Shallan and Wit together were amazing (my favorite characters). I really loved chapter 82. Here's a combined quote that so inspired me: ""It's terrible,"" Wit said. ""to have been hurt. It's unfair, and awful, and horrid. But Shallan... it's okay to live on... accept the pain, but don't accept that you deserved it."" The book surprised me so much, in good ways! What they did with the Thrill, with Teft, with Renarin. So many good things. Moash has me sad, but Venli makes me happy! And where the Assassin is :d Overall, when I finished reading I had good feelings. Just the beginning of the book makes me not able to call this the best book ever.","2018-06-30","United States","","true","68","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MYV3IG4KF67H"
"B01NAWAH85","4","It's a long book. That you couldn't possibly listen to in one day.","I recently purchased the audible audiobook version of Oathbringer about 1.5 days ago. Amazon asked me for a review today of my purchase, Thankfully I have a day job, so unfortunately, I have been unable to listen to more than a few hours of the book at this point. I really enjoyed the first 2 books of the stormlight archives and I have enjoyed the first few hours of this book, so I decided to give it 4 stars. I will have to revise my rating after I have completed the book. I am lucky to have a job that requires a 45 minute commute and since the audiobook is about 48 hours long, it will take me several days to complete the book. What amazes me is the Amazon asked for a review of the audiobook, before it was physically possible for me to finish the book. I mean I do sleep and I haven't yet created a time machine. Audiobook reviews might provide better feedback for other customers if the reviews are formulated based on users who have completed the book. For example, the first novel in the stormlight archives, entitled The Way of Kings would have received a 1 star rating if I had based my review solely on the preface, but the book as a whole is actually one of my favorite books. Oathbringer so far continues in the footsteps of the previous installments. It switches between characters always leaving you wanting more of that characters story. If you are a fan of fantasy novels, I highly recommend that you read/ or listen to the The Way of Kings, Path of Raidence, and Edgedancer (in that order) prior to reading/listening to this book.

"B01NAWAH85","5","Another great work in the series","Oathbringer lives up to the hype of the previous book in the series. Overall the Stormlight Archives feels a bit slow and the majority of the action always happens at the end, which is a. little frustrating, as the other part of the book is usually just building up towards the final. That doesn't mean to say that the other part is boring or bad (as evident by the rating i have given this book), it's just that all the books just follow the same pattern of buildup, buildup and then action. They don't feel as spontaneous as some may like, including me. I feel that there should be more actions and less brooding inside the characters heads (which is very interesting, but feels a bit too much).","2024-06-11","United States","","true","70","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37CL3FOT9DNBF"

But each of them has had the best epic endings and themes ever. They move me to tears and teach valuable lessons through story. This one was no different. The author does a fantastic job of world building and characterization. Each character is so unique and incredible. So real! This volume had some heart-wrenching scenes for Kaladin and Dalinar. I felt this book was mostly Dalinar’s backstory, showing why he is the man he is. Wow. It’s a crazy story, where ultimately he learns to rise whenever he stumbles. Shallan comes to love who she really is, too. King Taravingian reveals more about himself, too—the darkness within and the why behind it. We’ve known these characters for several books, yet somehow, I felt as if I was just learning truth about them. They are phenomenal books. You just have to be patient when you start them and realize it won’t be a fast read, and when scenes or people come in that don’t seem to fit at all, exercise those patience muscles. Everything comes together eventually. The best things in life usually don’t come quickly, and these books are the same. You have to work and put in the time to be rewarded with the awesomeness (salute to my girl, Lift) from these books. I love that each book truly ends in a fulfilling way, yet this is an epic fantasy…and it’s not over yet. But the author is kind and never leaves me on a cliffhanger. Thank you, thank you.

"B01NAWAH85","5","Sanderson at the top of his form, now with deeper characters and emotional insight.","Disclaimer/Bias Warning: I was a beta and gamma reader for this book. I still paid for it when it was released. In my biased opinion, this is one of the best fantasy novels of the past decade, and Sanderson's strongest book yet. If you've read the first two volumes of the Stormlight Archive, you know what to expect from this book. A vast array of characters, a deeper understanding of Surgebinding and the lost secrets of the Knights Radiant, a better look at the alien world of Roshar, giant teleporting swords and magic power armor, swearing that doesn't offend, a set of flashbacks focused on one of the main characters, and a better understanding of how the epic story being told in this ten-book series fits into the even larger meta-epic of the Cosmere. Moments of doubt. Moments of despair. And the old Brandon standby, Moments of Awesome. And yeah, you get all of that. But wait, there's more! Sanderson's writing has leveled up again. Oathbringer hits harder than ever before on character building. The first two books showed how Our Heroes, nearly all of whom are affected in some way by mental illness (depression, dissociative identity disorder, substance abuse and addiction, autism, post-traumatic stress, missing memory, etc.), will only be able to save the world by coming to accept themselves for who they are. For what the world and their choices have made them. The character revelations and turmoil in this volume are far, far more poignant and hard-hitting than before. That makes this more than just epic fantasy. In many ways, it's also a self-help textbook targeted squarely at anyone in mental distress. Be careful reading this book. It just might make you feel better about yourself.","2017-11-22","United States","","true","72","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3K4HSLCL32Z1V"
"B01NAWAH85","5","Brandon Sanderson continues to deliver!","Oathbringer starts up right where Words of Radiance left off. The Everstorm ravages across Roshar. The Knights Radiance need to unite the nations of the world the face this new threat. But Dalinar, the new leader of the Knights Radiance, has a dark and troubled past. In his youth, fighting to help his brother conquer the nation of Alethkar, he committed many acts of wanton destruction. How can the peoples of the world trust a man with such a bloodied past? As Dalinar seeks to unite, Shalan has to deal with her fractured psyche. As she delves into her illusionary powers, and creates new identities with which to spy, who she truly is becomes harder and harder for her to recognize. But Shalan cannot afford to fall apart. Not when the world itself is at stake. And Kaladin will have to learn a valuable lesson of his own, that tries he might he cannot protect everyone. Sanderson has delivered another epic door stopper to enthrall fans of epic fantasy. Oathbringer brings to life the characters of the world of Roshar telling us into the past of Dalinar. The characters are tested like never before as a struggle against the ultimate enemy of their world, a being of immense power and malevolent designs. For fans of epic fantasy, Sanderson once again shows why he is one of the modern masters of the genre. Oathbringer is a book that gripped you from beginning to end, letting you live in the characters heads, and bring them to life. This is a must-read book for all fans of fantasy.

It is certainly all of those things, but this third book marks it as something more, too. It’s a story about acceptance, change, and growth; about how being human means being, to one degree or another, broken. It’s a series about learning to live with that, and live heroically anyway. It’s a series that truly leaves you better for having read it. And in case you’re worried, Sanderson delivers payoff in SPADES in this one. The battle at the end is epic in every sense of the word. That being said, some people complain about the pacing. To them I say -- you're reading a 1000+ page book series, just enjoy the journey! I loved that the main characters weren't always charisma defined. People - even great people - have their lull moments and Kaladin floated here for a bit and Shallan had a breakdown. Both situations are very human. Kaladin can't always be peaking (WoK) or troughing (most of WoR). Meanwhile, as the world grows more complicated, the middle volume will always have the most corners to fill. I loved the expansion of the narrative to more characters and the addressing of corner/aside issues going on behind the scenes. Because this is the one book where Sanderson has the time to do so -- the next two books will essentially finale part I and part II. This is HP #5, and it's a little too long. I didn't mind. The payoff was worth it.","2019-09-14","United States","","true","75","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UHCAW3HIG20R"
"B01NAWAH85","5","Brand Sand! “The Man” (the good kind though!)","Without too many spoilers I have to say, chapter 55, Alone Together, is my absolute favorite and does so much to underline one of the major underlying themes of the book: being different. I am not sure if Brandon Sanderson is secretly Black, or maybe was just Black in a past life, or is currently 49.99% Black, or, now hear me out, is just such a complete weirdo and outcast that he understands what most Black people have gone through in regards to feeling like outsiders in their own communities and country. Or... maybe he is just amazing, amazingly empathetic and an amazing writer. I, personally, in my not-even-close-to-being-humble opinion (imnectbho, for those keeping track), believe it to be a combination of them all (the math gets iffy). Rlain epitomizes the plight and life of all us weirdos, outcast, different-beat-marchers, and other folks. I admire Brand Sand (we should definitely be on a first-name, or at the very least, nickname basis after all of the money I have forced him to take from me by buying his ridiculously expansive, yet completely worth it, books) even more. Also, YES, i just coined “Brand Sand”, trademark it and I will agree to only collect royalties in the form of free (discounted? 😬) future books. I just felt that “BS” was too horrible a nickname for a writer (or maybe too on the nose for someone who makes up stories for a living?). I seem to be digressing and rambling in a gushing review, sors (that was for the millennials; they know what it means)! “Brand Sand better”! Okay, okay, it means “sorry!” I quit now , for now...😁👍🏾","2018-01-30","United States","","true","76","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36U3BU5UK5QW9"

"B01NAWAH85","5","By far the best Fantasy series going today","The Stormlight Archive is back! By far the best Fantasy series going today, Brandon Sanderson introduces the next massive volume in a story so large it actually feels like 3 books in we are still just touching the surface of whats to come. Thats not to say that the story is lagging or slow, oh no my friends, that is very far from whats happening. This is an absolutely epic tale that should be played out in huge doses not only because the story is spectacular, but, there is a deep, complex world history to be unfolded. In the 3rd volume we pick up almost immediately from events that concluded book 2. All our main charectars are present and a few new ones are added to the already large cast as we see the daunting task ahead in Roshar as the Everstorm has been invoked. Many changes are brought about by the passing of this unique Storm and none of them are good for Dalinar, Kal & the previously established core group we follow. As I said, this book begins a whole new set of hurdles to deal with and a realization that this will no longer be a conventional story about two factions at war to resolve the dispute. The revelations in Oathbringer make it clear that there is no way to resolve the unfolding story in any conventional sense as there are not clearly defined ""good"" guys and ""bad"" guys. Its much more complex than that. Oh how I long for the next installment. Cant wait cant wait. Recommended?

"B01NAWAH85","4","Quite disappointed. I loved the first two books. BUT... The end is amazing","REVIEW AFTER FINISHING: After seeing the book through to completion, I have to amend my original review. Everything makes sense now... I should've known. While I will still say that 90% of the book is tedious and boring, the remaining 10% makes up for all of it and I actually had real tears in my eyes at times. I am really glad I decided to finish it. My wife is so confused how I could go from hating this book to raving about it. I don't know what happened, but all I can say is I am so glad I read it. ORIGINAL REVIEW (3/4 of the way through): Two stars. Quite disappointed. I loved the first two books, but I could not get into this third one. Felt like a wheel of time book (which I hated). So many plot lines that were not important and uninteresting. Shallan's character becomes even more unbearable as she deals with serious multiple personality disorder. The Voidbringers end up being a big let down and aren't very believable or interesting. The Unmade plot lines took up soooo much of the writing, but felt totally lame in the end and I really couldn't get myself to care. There were no surprises at all, even Dalinar's backstory... no suspense. Tons of cheesy dialogue throughout the whole book (which I'm guessing is some bleed through from Sanderson writing young adult books in between books 2 & 3). What a bummer... I am very, very close to giving up reading the rest.","2018-04-02","United States","","true","81","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3H6VTJPUVAUX0"

"B01NAWAH85","4","Some sections a slog but still engaging.","Wow! It's a lot harder to get through a 1000+ page book these days. I may have room for about one a year. This is the strongest current on-going fantasy series. It's a big book - but it's not weighed down by truckloads of exposition, meaningless descriptions or pointless events. Sanderson takes the time to write characters that you'll actually like and lets you spend time and learn more about them. It is an absolute pleasure. The thing I appreciate the most about Sanderson, especially when writing a book like this, is that he respects the intelligence of the reader. He doesn't feel the need to write in absolutely every connecting scene or event. He knows that anyone reading that's paying attention can put two and two together and see where it's going. This isn't to be confused with Scalzi's habit of characters putting together intricate plans that we're never informed of so we see them play out without a hitch so we can marvel at their cleverness. This is simply trusting the reader to be able to think, ""Oh I think I know where this is going."" which makes it a rewarding experience when we're right. It builds up a wonderful sense of anticipation that makes reading exciting. There was a bit of the book that was a slog to me (Shadesmar) but I know that's the sort of worldbuilding a certain type of Sanderson fan salivates over. It wasn't bad - it just wasn't my cup of tea.","2019-09-04","United States","","true","83","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R18VRESMTCIZOS"

"B01NAWAH85","4","Great continuation of a wonderful series","Overall, I enjoyed this book. Not as much as Words of Radiance, but still quite a bit. We learn A LOT in this book. Both about certain characters and about the history of Roshar. Dalinar's back story is really interesting and seeing how much he has changed is amazing. Oh and can I say...I love Nightblood (the sword Szeth is wielding, for anyone who does not know...I recommend reading Warbreaker if you want some history on the sword). Please do give us more amusing Nightblood interactions in the future. Pattern is also as amusing as ever. Anyway, I do have a few issues. I didn't like how Kaladin was sort of relegated to the sidelines in this book. I suppose Sanderson wanted to add some more view points beyond the usual Dalinar/Kaladin/Shallan, but in order to do that he kind of axed some Kaladin chapters and pushed him out of the picture. Which is a shame because he is my favorite. Hopefully, this does not happen again in the next two books. We really don't need the million view points of very minor characters especially if Kaladin or one of the more major characters is being sacrificed in favor of that. Also, don't know how I feel about Shalladin and Adolin together. I always found them very shallow together. Guess I've resigned myself to those two being being a thing, but I honestly think they are really boring together. But again, the book is still is a good addition to the series and I am really looking forward to the next book. :)","2017-12-17","United States","","true","85","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36DSIM14ABNJX"
"B01NAWAH85","3","Carried","I'm a Sanderson fan. I love the first book however, this one... needs help. Without giving anything away, there is a feeling that began to creep into book 2 which unfortunately thrives in book 3. That feeling is a lack of things to do for the characters. Sometimes you're just kinda there with them, though they don't really do anything meaningful or advance the plot in almost any way. There is a distinct lack of choices being made that make you question why we've even cut to the character in the first place. As someone who slogged through the wheel of time series, it makes me nervous for future volumes. And yes, as mentioned in many other reviews, there's the love triangle that began to seep into book 2, making a stronger appearance here which is, frankly, shallow and insulting to the characters. It's like the author is saying ""whelp, there's only 1 female I really wrote into your part of the world so I guess you're goina have a thing for her."" Now, due to the size of the book, that's understandable. There's no way at 1100+ pages there is any room to create any other remotely potential meaningful love interests, but that results in feeling shoe-horned in and in no way engaging. Maybe it's there to placate some fans of the genre? Then there's the flashbacks. I'm still not sure if this is a good thing or not. When TV shows spend half the story explaining what happened before the show, or in another episode, I just want to stab something. But in this book, well, when the most interesting thing that happens to a character doesn't happen in the current time line, I think there might be a problem afoot. That's all I'll say about that. Overall, I think the name-brand carries this book to 3 stars, but, if the series continues in this fashion, I can see it going downhill fast. Maybe the editor isn't being tough enough, or he wrote himself into a couple of corners, but I expected more from this book and hope the next one comes back strong.","2017-12-14","United States","","true","86","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTA0MWT3WA7B0"

"B01NAWAH85","5","Well written book, with realistic characters who make a huge progressions in their characters in this book","This is another excellent book in this series. You really get to see your favorite characters progress, as well has having a few surprising twists your way. These characters aren't your classical heroes who have it all together and just have to find out how to defeat the bad guy. They are all broken in someway and have to overcome that brokenness and perceiver anyway, because no one else can save everyone. There is plenty of seriousness, but there is also a lot of levity as well. There are several funny parts that just pop out and surprise you. One that comes to mind is a scene between Lift and Dalinar, where he asks her if she has a weapon. I won't spoil it, but I burst out laughing. If you can do that with a book, you know the writing is excellent. I really like how much you seem to get in this book. I feel like the last two books spent more time setting up the characters to evolve than actually evolving them. I think they all take huge steps and the whole world gets shaken up in this book. I highly recommend reading this series. Honestly, I recommend reading anything by Brandon Sanderson as I haven't found anything I didn't really like, yet. I discovered him when he took over for Robert Jordan on 'Wheel of Time"". I think he did a good job there, as well.

"B01NAWAH85","4","A book read, an oath kept","4/5 Well I'm caught up now and can we what the, fuss is about. Oathbringer continues the Stormlight Archive with another massive tome focusing in in Dalinar as the 'spotlight' character. It was long in the tooth, particularly part 3 and then it sped up in the beginning of part 4 only to slow slightly some with some pretty repetitive moments/fight pieces . Part 5 of course was bananas. Like the characters for the most part, the action is always good, and big ideas are there but sometimes the prose just isn't immersive enough for me, it can be cheesy as hell(!), and while people say Sanderson is untouchable on worldbuilding, it comes off expansive but not very deep. I'm finding he is prety inconsistent as a writer. Some characters are genuinely interesting or funny, others he aspires to do the same but cannot. He can write great action scene but dialog can be very clunky. The world he builds is diverse and clever but not strikingly deep. Themes are present but they aren't particularly eye opening and are generally low hanging fruit. Good stuff though, it was like an MCU movie; and I enjoy those for what they are just like I did this. Excited for RoW. I just hope we can move on from the excessive buildup to get the dessert at the end.","2020-04-25","United States","","true","93","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UC5QGIEK683N"
"B01NAWAH85","5","and does a fantastic job of moving the story along","For the middle book in a series this book answers a ton of questions, clarifies tons about the world, and does a fantastic job of moving the story along. But sadly I seem to lack enjoyment or interest in some of the characters this time around. Dalinar and Taravangian are amazing. I read and enjoyed every bit of their stories. I also enjoyed Renarin and Jasnah and would have liked more from them. But Kaladin and Shallan, who for me carried the previous books, fell completely flat. Kaladin gets a solid number of chapters but makes almost no growth as a character and just seems to fail or flail a lot. Shallan on the other hand regresses as a character through most of the novel. This clashes with her abilities and achievements and I was left at the end wondering if she had actually made any progress whatsoever. I also had trouble finding interest in the story of Bridge 4. They are so tethered to Kaladin that chapters without him just didn’t seem to add much. I don’t actually know whether I’m glad they are a factor in the story or not. But I’m a big picture reader and there was a fantastic amount of big picture in this novel. It may simply be that Kaladin and Shallan had not grown as much as I thought they had in the previous two novels. Whatever… It’s a must read.

"B01NAWAH85","5","Good addition to series - plot surprised me a number of times","Before reading this, I re-read the first 2 (door stopper sized) books, then the brief novella Edgedancer (which was a lot more fun than the serious cover suggests) and finally Oathbringer. The 'journey' of all that reading has brought me great pleasure. Mr. Sanderson has a writing style that pulls me into the universe and carries me along with the characters. The Oathbringer story dodges left and right and spins around, and sometimes I was frustrated with characters I enjoyed disappearing for many pages, or events being too slow and then too quick, and a lot of times the story went places I wasn't expecting... but in the end, I was always engrossed in the universe that Mr. Sanderson has been creating and loved being surprised with how things progressed. This book, Oathbringer, seems to go at a different pace than the first two. That was perfectly fine for me, the story that was being told shifted significantly in this third book, the world seemed to get a lot bigger, which seems to have brought on a different pace. Oathbringer seems to have more reveals than the first two books put together. Learn a lot in this book. Overall... love the stormlight series, very much enjoyed this book. Hope the next one comes out soon so that I remember the details and don't have to re-read everything.","2018-02-07","United States","","true","97","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GN01KLEJ1KD9"

If your not reading for the world-building, that is both beautiful and terryfingly intricate, a trait associated with all of Sanderson's body of work, then read for the character work, which is in turn some of the best in the genre. The world of Roshar is a living and breathing thing. Alien to our understanding of what a fantasy world should be, but will feel familiar to hardcore fans of the genre. This series has a huge cast of unique characters, each book focuses on the back story of one. there is a character for everyone to connect with.

I love how Sanderson was able to broaden the epic to involving the fate of all Roshar while still developing his major characters. I feel like many other fantasy authors would have a hard time broadening the conflict and making it feel real. I feel like this was also a preparatory book for the rest of the series- laying down the rules for the international coalition, figuring out command structure in Alethkar and among the radiants, etc. We get a lot of answers in this book which is rewarding. I do hope we see Shallan progress and become a more mature character in the next book. I feel like it's time for her to take on more responsibility and become who she needs to be. My favorite story arc in this volume was Dalinar's. By far the best wrapped up of all the characters. Felt somewhat disappointed Shallan had not quite forged herself into a cohesive person but I understand this is leaving her open for frailty in future books. I do wish we had some more build up to the wedding at the end as I felt like I needed to be shown more and not just told that Adolin was the right choice for her. Overall kaladin felt a bit sidelined. And Jasnah was a welcome character to have back.
