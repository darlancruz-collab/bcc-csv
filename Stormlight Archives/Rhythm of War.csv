"B0826NKZHR","5","Amazing book that puts characer development before story","I'm reading a lot of negativity around the lack of action in ROW. I think the type of reader you are might influence how you feel about it. This book is about character development through and through, and doesn't really advance the story at all. Honestly the story is at the same place it was after SA3. But you know what, that's ok by me because the character development was so incredible. Now even on the subject of character development I see lots of complaints. People are sick of Shallan dealing with mental illness, or Kaladin dealing with his father. If you want a standard fantasy trope of the ""good guy"" growing up and beating the ""bad guy,"" I'm not so sure this series is for you. The characters are painted in all sorts of grey shades and have a lot of negatives about them, just like you and me, it makes them feel so much more real. The struggles they go through has put a tear to my eye more than once, and I can't say that about a lot of characters I've come across in any medium! Brandon's attention to detail even extends to the ""bad guys,"" with some really good development and backstory of some, and even the main ""bad guy"" is painted in shades of grey and has a development arc. Otherwise the writing was superb, but again short on action. The biggest action was at the end, those few chapters were well worth the read, especially because that character development brought those characters so much closer to me. But I get it, on some level Brandon may be falling to the same sickness Robert Jordan had, that of writing books just to milk the series. But if that's the case I really don't care, because I know one day (like with WOT) I will have to say goodbye to these characters forever. If you like SA, especially if you love the characters, don't hesitate to pick up this book. Just appreciate it for what it is, one long character development study with not much action or story progression.","2022-01-24","United States","","true","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJKFXCWF86EMN"
"B0826NKZHR","5","Life before death.","Is it even possible to give these books less than five stars? Is it even allowed? Every time we are blessed with a new book in the Stormlight Archive, it becomes one of the best books I've ever read. Plain and simple. They're just that fun. They reach those heights, that level of epic. A forewarning, this review will be unfettered praise. I somehow seem to forget just how much I love this series between installments. It's only natural I suppose, to need to immerse yourself in something again to remember just how much it grips you, but still, I seem to forget. It's just such a good story. Every little piece of it. The more we learn the more fun it is, and it is already a massive, interwoven, deliciously complex story. I can't get enough. And so when a new installment appears, I am consumed. Not just in the story itself, but the universe of which it is part. The story, the Coppermind entries, the WoB, all of it. Consumed. Rhythm of War starts extremely strong. The one year time-jump makes catching up to the new norm a very fun experience. Our favorite characters are challenged in new and distinct ways: by forcing them to re-examine what it means to uphold their Oaths, by requiring them to face truths at the risk of losing the love around them, by pushing them to shed doubt in the face of danger, by challenging them to seek freedom when it would be so much easier to give up. In a series known for upping the ante with each new book, this installments still feels fresh; like an important piece of the puzzle, and a natural extension of the story. One gets the sense that Brandon knows exactly what he's doing... And so I was enthralled. Having just finished it, I still am. There's nothing like the last stretch of a Sanderson book. He may be the only author who leaves you with more questions than you had when you began, but I thank him for it. He takes you up to the highest highs, and let's you ponder the future, marinating in the experience. His books are just so cool. And that sounds trite, but it's really not. No other books make me sit back and think ""Damn, that is so cool"" as often as Sanderson's. It's just a fact. And no they aren't literary masterworks or Pulitzer Prize winners, but the complaints that I used to see--hell, the complaints that I used to have--about his books are hard to apply these days. His skills have grown in noticeable and appreciated ways as things like character development and emotionally charged scenes become a major strong point in his work. I go on and on about Brandon's worldbuilding, everyone does. But there's a damn good reason for that. Because as much as he is growing in other areas, worldbuilding and plotting remain his major strengths. He builds the kinds of worlds that are so interesting you stay up thinking about one little piece of them when you should be sleeping. Roshar--and the greater cosmere in general--is an incredible place to visit, and one that grows more enticing by the page. It is science-fiction flavored fantasy in the same way that something like Dune is fantasy flavored science-fiction. And for someone like me, that's a homerun. No review of this book could even come close to summarizing all my thoughts on it. Installments of the Stormlight Archive are massive, and each one is a lengthy experience. A lot runs through your head during a thousand pages; more than a thousand. Plus, to truly review this book I would need to delve into the most massive of massive spoilers. But I will say this... There is no doubt that the Stormlight Archive is Brandon's best series; he admits this himself. 'Magnum Opus' may be the term thrown around down the line. As such, this is the series where he's really starting to open things up, as far as the greater cosmere is concerned. It’s still on a small enough scale that you don’t have to have any idea what I’m talking about, but the connections are flowing. He is no longer being coy about the existence of other planets, and the ability to travel to and from said planets. It’s right there in the text, and it’s all starting to come out. So what that does is get readers who may have never read any of his books other than Stormlight really excited for the cool things they’ve yet to discover. And it also offers a hugely rewarding reading experience for those who have read the other cosmere books, as we piece things together and notice all the ""hidden"" gems. The balance Brandon has achieved in this is nothing short of remarkable. I won't pretend his books are for everyone. Sometimes people want something more, and what's more subjective than one's reading material? But if you're looking for a fun world to immerse yourself in, with a master storyteller at the helm, pick up a book by Brandon Sanderson. Maybe I'll see you on the other end of the rabbit hole.","2020-12-06","United States","","true","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQXAM1057UB7C"
"B0826NKZHR","5","The best modern work of fantasy I've ever read","Taking Tolkien out of the equation, as someone who read all of wheel of time and all of the current 5 game of thrones( my with a clash of kings in game of thrones ranking as my favorite), I understand this to be a bold claim. This book is a payout on the investment of the prior 3 books and reveals that no detail no character in the first 3 books was wasted. All of the characters, the events are leading up to something-an epic world, with a story worth re-reading. Warning, this book starts off slow. It took 300 to 400 pages for it to get going. When I arrived at the thought "" the pacing is too slow in this one"", the narrative takes off and doesn't slow till the end. Brandon Sanderson does such a great job of writing characters as humans, addressing depression, trauma, and dementia in his characters in a human and compassionate way. He ties up almost every lose end in this book whole still keeping the reader invested in what happens next. This book made me consider rereading the first 3 because it points to how the events in the first book continues to have echoes in this expansive rich universe Brandon Sanderson has created. In fantasy, its a book that made me feel all of the emotions, exuberance, despair, sadness, and hope. There's a scene in the book that made me tear up, something I never expected a book would make me do. He treats the characters with amazing tenderness and provides closure to many character arches.. If you want action, complex characters, fantasy, and rich story telling, this book has it and this series is for you.","2024-01-16","United States","","true","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OJY77PXFXM31"
"B0826NKZHR","4","Great story, with some minor plot issues and some bigger editorial issues","Another huge, impressive, fast-moving book in what is one of the best fantasy series of the last decade, that would be a 5-star review with a better focus on the edit and a few limitations on intentionally confusing the reader. I give it a big recommendation for fans of high fantasy, with the hopes that some of these issues will be cleared up (though, to be honest, I'm going to read the rest of the series even if those persist). The fourth book in the Stormlight Archive series sees all of the main protagonists going through personal crises. Dalinar, Radiant Bondsmith and king of Urithiru, the mystical city of Radiants, is struggling both to understand his powers and to maintain the alliance of nations against the threat of the Fused, the enemy that arose from the strange race of former slaves now infused with powers from the dark god Odium, and also trying to outthink the traitor-king Taravangian. Navani, Dalinar's scholar wife and former sister-in-law, works tirelessly to study fabrials, the gems capturing magic spren that allow feats of wonder like flight (not to mention the full functions of the city itself), but despite making great advances, she still views herself as fraudulent, a scholar in name only. Kaladin Stormblessed, Radiant Windrunner and Captain of Dalinar's armed forces, has a mighty bout of battle-shock, freezing against an enemy in the worst of times, causing him to suffer one of his dark times of self-doubt and nihilism. Shallan, Radiant Lightweaver and wife of Dalinar's son Adolin, is beginning to lose herself to the two other ""faces"" she wears under her illusions, giving way to a nefarious third alternate persona that may hide a secret from her past, and leading her into taking missions for a mysterious secret society that promises her the answers she seeks. Adolin struggles to find his purpose, when it seems all those around him are bursting with special powers and divine responsibilities while he spends his days studying the latest fashions and the now-obsolete art of dueling. When the Fused manage to invade and occupy Urithiru while Dalinar is away in the west prosecuting the war, thereby cutting off the alliance from use of the teleporting powers of the Oathgates, all of these main actors, and their hundreds of supporting characters, are left to resist as well as they can during their most difficult personal times. As always in this series, and indeed with every other book by Sanderson I've read, there's a metric ton of action equal to the multifarious interlacing storylines. If you like war stories, there's lots of fighting; if magic is your thing, that's there on virtually every page in multiple forms; if political intrigue is up your alley, this story presents so many factions and internecine plots that you may need a flowchart. The plot moves quickly, and the book is hard to put down, with character arcs that are mostly satisfying for what is essentially one of the middle books of this incredibly lengthy planned series. Sanderson obviously has planned the series in such detail that he's got thousands of plot points to dole out over the course of ten 1200+ page books, even if his plan is still inchoate and undiscernible to the reader at this point in the story. It does seem that there's an almost intentional confusion of magic systems and histories on the part of the author, so that the entire backstory leading up to the current page is never solidly formed in the reader's mind, as every few hundred pages a new revelation throws everything the reader previously understood on its head. It also seems that the author is trying to form a Grand Unified Theory of Nerdiness by attempting to combine high fantasy, urban fantasy, sci-fi, steampunk, and political thrillers into a single tale, to the point where at times the efforts seem slightly disjointed. A corollary to this is that a series of this size and scope that might see a handful of years between new books NEEDS to have an appendix with a Dramatis Personae and a glossary; while there's a short description of the various magic systems at the end of this book, there's nothing to remind the reader who all the hundreds of characters are and what their positions/powers might be. And I've said it before: the fact that Lift, one of the absolute best characters in the entire series, doesn't have a larger, central role in the main narrative is unforgivable, and to wait 550+ pages in this book to reintroduce her is a mortal sin -- if she's good enough for a stand-alone novella, she's good enough for a few dedicated chapters in a book more than a thousand pages long. As for mechanics, I was less than pleased. The book is rife with split infinitives, the use of ""the times where"" (vs ""the times when""), spelling mistakes (like ""rifled through"" instead of ""riffled through""), subject/pronoun disagreement, employment of em dashes when literally any other punctuation mark would be more appropriate; the use of ""reveal"" as a noun; and other grammarian pet peeves that disturb my zen. I understand that in this permissive era of writing, many of these are guidelines rather than rules, but the use of colloquial internet-English in a high fantasy takes the reader out of the ""high"" part of the fantasy in a way that is completely avoidable by following a few grammar, punctuation, and syntax rules. On top of this, the unbelievably impressive illustrations in this book are nearly ruined by accompanying text that is so difficult to read because of font and font size (EVEN IN HARDBACK SIZE) that they may as well be written in alien script. Listen, I love this series and most other things by Sanderson I've read, but I can love a thing and want it to be better. So, it's a 5-star story (with a HUGE RECOMMENDATION for fans of high fantasy), with some troubling plot issues and some seriously problematic editorial issues. I'm investing a boatload of time in reading these massive tomes of his, and I hope he respects that time investment enough to cure some of these foibles. Overall, though, big ups to this series.","2021-01-17","United States","","true","4","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1POO3ZFSXR537"
"B0826NKZHR","5","An incredible work of modern fantasy","On occasion, there comes a piece of art into the world that comes to refine and redefine its genre. Just as 'Star Wars' came to be emblematic of the space opera and summer blockbuster, and 'Scream' reinvigorated the slasher film, I firmly believe 'Rhythm of War'--and more broadly, the Stormlight Archive as a whole--to be a landmark novel in the genre of modern fantasy, and a novel which everyone should read. At its heart, what sets 'Rhythm of War' apart from other modern fantasy is its relevance, its originality, and its optimism. Not coincidentally, these are three reasons why the novel should be read. In terms of relevance, we live in a world of contention and chaos. Mental health problems are continually on the rise, there is political and cultural turmoil around the globe, and we as a race have yet to deal with the awful specters of racism, poverty, and sexism. While many modern fantasy novels deal with such themes, there is a tendency towards the fantastical--to brush aside reality in favor escapism. Not so with the Stormlight Archive! Amidst the fantasy of epic battles and arcane mysteries of the novels, we are treated to characters who battle realistically with depression, who struggle to reconcile differences of belief and ideals, and who struggle with both external and internal racism and sexism. In 'Rhythm of War', Sanderson is able to effectively create a compelling fantasy narrative that is nonetheless nested in the personal struggles common to all humanity. And what a narrative it is! I will freely admit that Sanderson has certain flaws as a writer, such as an over-reliance on a few favorite 'pet tropes.' Yet, despite his weaknesses, this man EXCELS at crafting unique narratives and settings. Foreshadowing seems to come second nature to the man, but he does it with all the subtlety of a master painter. His world-building is unparalleled amongst his contemporaries, in part because of how well thought out it is. To give you a sense of what this man is capable of, he's invented a set of laws that dictate exactly how all magic in his written universe work. You heard me right--Sanderson invented a set of magical physics for the specific purpose of ensuring his world-building is consistent. Finally, while Sanderson's writing is both relevant and creative, there is something more than this that sets apart 'Rhythm of War' and the Stormlight Archive as a whole. We see in modern fantasy a trend towards the dark and the gritty, evident in series like 'Game of Thrones' and 'The Witcher.' While these shows and novels are not necessarily bad, they create the unfortunate connotation that 'real art' must be dark, fetid, Machiavellian, needlessly violent, and filled with gratuitous sex--in a word, cynical. Furthermore, these series treat the problems of their world as a given, in a way 'giving-in' to their cynicism, admitting that it is a part of life and reality. This is where Sanderson truly shines apart, and why 'Rhythm of War' is so essential for the modern reader. It doesn't shy away from violence, nor from showing that people have great potential for cruelty and villainy. However, despite all of the terrible things that happen in the novel, Sanderon's characters consistently show that just because our world is bad, doesn't mean it cannot become better. Where other novels choose cynicism as a means of coping with the realities of an imperfect world, 'Rhythm of War' opts instead for optimism, and in doing so gives the modern reader a reminder that there is always hope for a better world, provided we are willing to sacrifice for it. In the interest of time, I'm cutting my review here short. In summation: if you are looking for a creative book, that is truly engaging and original, read this! If you are looking for a fantasy novel that is nonetheless relevant to modern life, read this! And finally, if you are sick and tired of seeing pessimism and cynicism dominate the literary landscape, and want something hopeful instead, read this! One final note: yes, the book is long. Over 1000 pages, to be semi-exact. For some, this is a deterrent. Don't sweat it! It reads quite easily, and the series flows very smoothly. May I also point out that you just read this entire review, and I promise you--it's a lot more fun than my writing!","2022-02-11","United States","","true","5","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R290KZ8S7ZVSZX"

"B0826NKZHR","5","Masterpiece","There are books you can simply call masterpieces and this is certainly one of them. Reading this you will doubt this can really be the work of a man, it’s far too well though, packed with so much information, so much story it’s feels impossible. I read this book non stop, paused everything and just read. Anything else was a break, a distraction. Not many books give you this feeling, this necessity to go to the next page and the next after and you just can’t resist. And I cried, not just once. The moments were powerful and not telegraphed. It was inspiring and the depth of ideas presented, sentiments was mindnumbling. You will find heroes and enemies all masterfully shaped, a plethora of them and you won’t rush to your favorite because they all have something to give. The story is good and the revelations plenty. You will be in shock and awe struggling to fit it all in the end. It was so much, how / what will fill the next books when we got so much here. To be honest we got so much more knowledge this book more than any other in the series. I hope this doesn’t kill the mystery from the future ones. Now the pacing was very good. It started really strong and to be frank it slowed down at 50%. I expected the last 15% of the book to happen right at the 50% but the next 35% was theory and character building. A touch slower than the rest of the book but still fulfilling. Usually, I feel sad when such a good book ends, but this one I know I will re-read for sure, hopefully at a slower pace and enjoy it again and again. If you are reading this anyway I’m sure you are already sold on the series! Enjoy it","2021-03-04","United States","","true","7","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FVRJIOPMM1TO"
"B0826NKZHR","5","The next Tolkien/Jordan prodigy","My favorite author, in modern times, hands down, is Mr. Sanderson! I first came across Mr. Sanderson when I fell in love with the 'Wheel of Time' (WoT) series, but was crushed upon hearing of Robert Jordans death. I was both; saddened for him personally, as well as, his lovely wife, and for his masterful series being left unfinished. Mrs. Jordan did the world's heart a solid in seeing the WoT series completed, and she fought through this terrible ordeal of greif, like a brave Aes Sedai from the WoT series. In hand picking an author to complete WoT, the greatest thing to happen to the fantasy/science fiction genre, is when she chose Mr. Sanderson. Thus, from out of the cold, unforgiving void of emptiness, came the shining, valiant Radiant-knight, Mr. Sanderson himself, to give us hope and a new author to discover-well, new to me at least. Since completing the WoT series, I was all in for Brandon. I have read everything, and I mean everything, he has put out for the public, and let me tell you, you will find no better writer than Brandon. He weaves so many intriguing, intricate sub plots in all his books. His magic system is so very unique, and quite believable by fantasy novel standards. His character building-coupled with his uncanny ability to place the reader in his minutely detailed world-is simply astounding. Topping it all off with random easter eggs planted in all the series.. They say, and I find it to be true myself, that you really can not just put down a Sanderson book, the time will fly when you are immersed in Brandon's works. I really think Tolkien would be immensely proud of and impressed with him, and I know that the late, great Mr. Jordan would be! Sorry for the long-winded review, but I really want to convey to good authors and publishers of grand works, the respect and appreciation that they deserve. A lot of hard work, creativity, and soul is poured into these books, and that is something that shouldn't be taken lightly. The Stormlight Archives are so freaking amazing, please do yourself a favor and read these books, you most certainly will not regret it. Promise! I didn't want to put too much of the story or plots of the Stormlight series in this review, so as not to spoil the books for would-be purchasers. Trust me though, they are worth every penny-really im surprised they aren't priced higher-I wont complain though.","2020-12-05","United States","","true","8","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LCPXUFCDZCM4"

It seemed really complicated with too much technical, but suddenly you are IN IT and you are hooked on the books. It was weird how that happened.

"B0826NKZHR","5","If this book were the first installment, we would not finish the series","I have great respect for Sanderson and his works. I am a big fan of the mistborn series, and WAS a huge fan of the stormlight archive. I am writing this SPOILER-FREE review as a true fan, with the hopes that it is taken as constructive criticism of what not to do on future installments. I will reference a couple of events from previous books. This book is mostly fluff. Very little of it is dedicated to advancing the plot. It creates more questions than answering old ones. It develops a lot of non-essential characters in ways that do not matter. Every paragraph is followed by a long description of the character's interpretation of things, to help us further understand their mind, and mental condition. This book is very dark, and heavy, and if it were not dropped in the middle of a series that I am heavily invested in finishing, I would have stopped reading it. Throughout the previous books, there are highly stimulating payoff moments that occur. Kaladin, fighting off arrows for his bridgemen, him and Adolin dueling against impossible odds, Dalinar hacking his way through seas of enemies, Kaladin's showdown with Amaram, etc. These events help to keep the momentum of the books going, while delivering a major payoff at the end, for fighting through the darkness of the main story. Book 4 lacks this payoff, both intermittently, and at the end. Not only is the story dark, simply due to the awful circumstances that everyone found themselves in for the entirety of the book, but also because of the constant deep delve into their minds, regarding these terrible circumstances. There is no real pay off in the end. Yes, a couple of key events transpire. Yes, the knowledge that those events transpired advances the story, but the way that these events transpired was not stimulating. Shallan and Adolin's story archs felt entirely unnecessary and were not entertaining. Kaladin's story arch was brutal - even worse than his walk through shadesmar in book 3. Lastly, I typically love scientific magic, but this book went too far. In a separate novel that involves wizards and wands, I dislike how magic is gratuitous. Characters can cast as many spells as they like, and there is no rhyme or reason as to why they might be tired, or why one character could best another, or even what limitations there are on a wizard's power. Conversely, my favorite novel, by Patrick Rothfuss does a great job of explaining the sweet simple science behind the magic. Supernatural actions have simple, yet engaging details of how they are done, with rules and limitations that are fun yet easy to understand. Previous installments of the stormlight archive have explained some rules of radiant powers, which are pretty solid in the way they are broken down. However, this installment gets much deeper into fabrial use and stormlight functionality. The book gets incredibly specific in these details, while also walking us through actual trial and error science behind it all, and painting pictures of tons of fantasy tools. The problem is, this is not REAL science, so this book is filling our minds with a bunch of science that will never be relevant to our actual lives. These chapters could have either been cut out, to reduce unnecessary reading fluff, or redirected into meaningful story/character development. In the future, please, less fluff, less deep diving into every single observation, less deep dive into the science, especially less deep dive into the initial wrong interpretation of the science. Let's see more action, more emphasis on the use of the powers that we have poured so many hours into understanding.","2022-07-15","United States","","true","14","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R51LEXVNH399B"

"B0826NKZHR","4","An unexpectedly gripping turn","Rhythm of War is an interesting case. The fandom—at least the circles I travel in—seems to have a poor opinion of this book, with opinions ranging from bad to mediocre-at-best. So, I went in with fairly low expectations, as I've struggled with how ponderous and padded the Stormlight Archive is from the start. Because of this, I feel like I enjoyed Rhythm of War more than many if not most readers. I wasn't particularly bothered by the passages about light, music, and math, as music and math have always been big parts of my life. I did feel this book was even more ponderous and padded than its predecessors. Yet the climax was masterfully done as I've come to expect of Sanderson by now. Some very hard hitting moments resonated particularly well with me. I won't talk about them as I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, but I will say that one was a speech of few words, and one was acceptance. While I am largely burnt out on the Cosmere in general, hopefully there's enough of a break between now and December 6th for me to enjoy Wind and Truth to its fullest at launch alongside all the long time Cosmere readers. An absolute must read, if only for the conclusion must follow depending on who you ask.","2024-11-18","United States","","true","16","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UC165WGPE1LW"
"B0826NKZHR","5","Stormlight Reborn","5 stars because I loved it. So here's my ramble. Critiques. Kholins feel too important. Throughout the book it's all about Dalinar, Navani, Renarin, and Adolin. Which is fine, but I feel like there should be others too? Small complaint. I love Kaladins arc in this book, but it almost feels like it went to quickly at the end and his growth kind of happened all in one moment. This could just be me reading it like that, but also I just feel eh. I loved how he focused on PTSD and Mental Health as I struggle with mental health issues and relate to this. Once again Sanderson gives characters anyone can relate to. I LOVED Shallans character arc. She really grows throughout this book. I will not spoil it. But the fact that she does what she does and grows so much, I could seriously feel her pain. While I don't have multipersonality disorder I could FEEL what it's like to have it. Adolin. His growth, but more so his bond and his honor and his owning up to not being the best. Combined with Maya's growth. I just. I think it's beautiful. This combined with how much the honor spren grow and how bad they were to him at first. I really enjoyed this. The HERALDS. AHG why. They are insane, but interesting characters man. I can't wait to see them grow in the future. I really liked Kelek and how he talks with Shallan and even helps her. Ishar is JUST WOW. The way radiants fight...It was so unexpected!!!! NAVANI AND REBONIEL. I can't even. I love this. This connection. This beauty. Science. AHG. Listen. Navani is a scholar and she needs to accept it and I just. I am so excited for her growth in this book because she discovers amazing things and the work and the love. I CAN'T. Reboniel makes me so so sad but also joyous. Her ending is wonderful. Venli and Rlain and Eshonai. She grows so much in this book, as it is her book. Her powered grow. But her relationship to others and her honesty with herself grows. There is so much progression it makes me so happy. This applies to Rlain as well. And the chapter with Eshonai might make you cry. There's so much more to this book, but that's all I can say without spoiling too much. Also, just watch for Taravangian...his progression and SZETH is pretty freaking lit. Okay. Layout. I don't like how Part 2 is basically all in Shadesmar and doesn't show the real world until part 3. It's a weird dynamic of staying with Adolin and Shallan and Navani, and never showing Emul until part 3. Definitely different. Also the flashbacks start in part 3 so I was confused as to who's book this is. I actually. I think this is technically Navani's book, but some people say it is Venli's book...I don't know who is right but that's okay!!","2021-05-28","United States","","true","17","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14N1T5X4Y7HJ5"

"B0826NKZHR","4","Cut was tiny but off","It looks like the cut the top of the book a bit too short.

"B0826NKZHR","5","Great pacing for the main storyline, I couldn't read it fast enough","The story can be split into three groups. There is the Navani, Kaladin, and Venli plot which I'd call the main plot. There is the Adolin, and Shallan plot which would be the secondary plot. And then there is the Dalinar and Jasnah plot which reads more like a set-up for book 5. As for how interesting these plots are relative to each other, I ended up skipping the other two to read ahead a bit on the main plot. If you happen to dislike Kaladin, then you likely won't like this book so much, since even though this is the Venli book it reads more like a Kaladin and Navani book. If there is one weakness in this book it is probably how the previous books did a terrific job of making the focal character shine whereas Venli does not really stand out here. Worse, other singers/parsh are more interesting than her. In any case, it is likely a matter of taste so that is why I still rate this with five stars. As mentioned, Navani also features heavily in this book. As someone in the sciences, her headspace in her POV is, to me, a realistic portrayal of how someone very much immersed in a technical field would think. Some may complain that it feels like an info-dump, some may just complain about the 'science,' but it is actually pretty light reading under the circumstances and I love how a technical person is actually portrayed to think in technical terms. As to how the plot goes, most plot resolutions were as predicted if you've gone to any forums discussing the books. I'd hate to call it predictable as the execution really sells it. Journey before destination. It is the journey of how those plots are resolved rather than the end itself that connects me to the story. Let's just say that 2 or 3 scenes in this book made me cry. My biggest fear was that some of the plot lines would actually undermine the character for me if it went as predicted, but Sanderson managed to do it in a way that made sense and was in two instances it felt cathartic to read it. I must say that it adds to my respect of Sanderson that he is likely aware of the theories his readers have on how certain plot points would be resolved and he still went with it. There is surprising the audience and there is being true to the characters in the story and the book reaches a nice balance between these things. On hindsight, it seemed like he lulled readers into thinking everything would be predictable only to hit us with that surprising turn near the end. I can't wait for book 5. The way Rhythm of War has set things up for the upcoming showdown, to me, book 5 just looks to be one big explosion.","2020-12-12","United States","","true","20","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MRSZDY7HZWNB"
"B0826NKZHR","3","Entertaining, but not his best work","This, the fourth installment of the Stormlight Archives is an entertaining book. For those who follow the expanded Cosmere news, there may be excitement because it takes things that were more subtle before and throws them into the limelight. Brandon Sanderson handled mental illness more carefully in this volume than in previous volumes, which addressed some previous criticism he has received. However, the his book lacked the momentum of previous books in the series. Viewpoint characters go through the same thought processes over and over until it felt repetitive. A few of the conversations felt forced, like the characters were saying things because the author wanted them to and not because they would say it themselves. Sometimes people knew or assumed things that they shouldn’t have known. It felt a lot like Harry Potter 5, where it needed to be more extensively edited and was longer than it should have been. At the same time awkwardly bridging the gap between separate episodic arcs and an overarching narrative.","2025-05-02","United States","","true","21","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L2NHG9CPZSJ0"

"B0826NKZHR","3","Long book that says nothing, great bedtime book.","I was once trapped in this author hole of dean koontz where 1 out of the 6 or 7 I read was okay with a coherent ending and I just assumed I was hitting duds on the rest. I read a lot that year and our book access was very limited. Kept trying, to only be pissed at another misfire. In my little opinion, Sanderson flirts this line a lot with storm light. These books are 3x to 4x the size of just a pick up book, and yet nothing happens. There is some chaotic moment at the end, but the build up is just stuff. You could say that it’s meant to drag the reader through the agony the characters find themselves in, hopelessness, at the mercy of another, confused, alone, grasping at the ideas to make it to the end. There’s so much stuff in this world and the other world and the other other world(s) with even the first book taking me a few attempts because of how foreign and complex everything was. Now it’s just these same 7 or so people just putzing around at the same time in different locations until one of the big things happen. Not simply set up who’s where and how they feel about it, but months of their boring life in whatever situation before the thing happens. Maybe there’s a reason not to cover all the surges or different radiants or spren and their view point in other world or the impacts of the different nations with what is going on on the whole planet, maybe the turtle people are pissed because where’s their trade maybe the shallow lake people have an influx of predators being driven in to escape the war and they are too whatever about everything to deal. Huge world that’s been established but just these people thinking about maybe doing something. Maybe that’s for the reader and their head cannon. That is more for short episodic books with a rich world and fast story telling so you can let your imagination run wild for the next installment. These books leave nothing to the imagination with how much the characters doing nothing are focused on for such long periods of time. And then the prequels to things that have already finished. We get so and so sucked big time and they are good now, and then to read about it probably 9 more times. I had to buy elantris because I need a bedtime book and these were just perfect. Rarely did I care so much I had to read one more chapter and they weren’t likely to reappear until the next part anyway after they did something interesting. It was great to pick it up as I’m laying down and not be confused whatsoever because they were doing slightly more of the same thing they’ve been doing every night. I knew I saved these for a reason and I’m disappointed I have to wait for a next installment because they seem like they should just kind of exist already. They aren’t riveting or mind blowing. They’re pretty good, but not too good. I’d recommend them for anyone that wants something easy to follow after you figure out what the hell he is talking about in the first book.","2022-08-12","United States","","true","25","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KF8UZ5MZWKVH"
"B0826NKZHR","4","This novel is another Epic Fantasy masterpiece by Brandon Sanderson","Overall, I enjoyed reading Rhythm of War. I like the realistic characters, descriptions, dialogue, illustrations, and epigraphs in this novel. I like most of the storylines in Rhythm of War. I also like that some of Shallan’s dialogue in this novel is funny. I like the pace in this novel. I like the experiments that Navani did with gemstones such as to capture Void Light. I like that some gems were the currency on Roshar because that gem currency is original. I don’t like that Moash told Kaladin to commit suicide to stop feeling depressed. The part of a chapter in this novel when Shallan merged two of her personalities isn't the right way to recover from Dissociative Identity Disorder. Overall, Rhythm of War is a fantasy masterpiece. Four out of five stars.","2024-10-14","United States","","true","26","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1K4WMBBLSMVDQ"
"B0826NKZHR","3","Very choppy, frustrating to read, rather depressing","Rhythm of War had some excellent moments in its thousand-plus pages, and the writing itself was wonderful, but just as I would be getting into the spirit of what was happening with a character, the author would jump to another character, another place, or (with uninteresting flashbacks) even another time. It was so disjointed and frustrating, especially because it might be fifty pages before the author returned to a character. It became all too easy to put the book down and do something else. It just didn’t captivate. If I could offer any suggestion to the author it would be to follow the characters for longer periods so the reader can establish and maintain rapport, especially when the blips of storyline are depressing and left hanging uncomfortably in the reader’ mind for long stretches. If that can’t be done, then there are too many storylines going on at once, and some of them should be another book. For example, I would have loved to read an additional, more coherent book about the Parshendi and their main characters such as Venli, so I got to know them and understand them. Instead, all of that information is fragmented and the feeling of knowing Venli or her sister or important others is greatly reduced. An opportunity missed. How can the reader enter into a character’s heart, or lack thereof, with only a few short pages at a time before being distracted by a long string of other events and characters. The plotline with Jasnah was wonderful, but it was all broken up. Part of the power of The Way of Kings was that it followed three characters devotedly and deeply. But in TROW we have many more “main” characters on top of those three. At this point the plot is so complex and the cosmere gods and powers and characters and kingdoms so numerous that I began having real trouble in keeping things straight. I got bogged down, frankly, with what power was what and who someone was, even though I had re-read the entire third book just prior to reading this. Jumping around from character to character made it so much harder to remember details or feel emotionally involved. A reader likes to settle in with the flow and be carried away (like in The way of Kings), but this was a jarring ride, and not fun.In addition, compared to the first three books, this book was actually kind of a downer. I didn’t like what happened with Kaladin, Shallon, or Dalinar. I didn’t like what happened with Wit, Lirin, Vinli, Szeth and others. It felt rushed and shallow and rambling and dismal. The mostly positive conclusions of individual stories just didn’t make up for the tedious angst of the previous hundreds of pages. TROW would have been better as a shorter, cleaner book without all the depressing and confusing filler that didn’t really advance the overall plot or positively develop characters we want to care about. And even more disappointing, all three original main characters are less likable now that I have read this latest book. Way too much time was given to deep-seated mental health problems that did not get resolved satisfactorily or realistically. A little of that goes a long way. This is a fantasy that I looked forward to reading through the many awful months of COVID-19 as an adventurous escape from real world health issues. I had enjoyed and liked the main characters so very much after the first three books, but my initial enthusiasm for the series is diminishing. What a shame. The Way of Kings and its first sequel were two of the most inspiring, most magical and best fantasies I had ever read. Please, Mr. Sanderson, lighten up a bit. Give us the space to know the characters more fully by having fewer story lines per book.","2021-01-04","United States","","true","27","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZ581G6D0L0FW"

It's always enjoyable when our burning questions are answered, just to have more mysteries in their wake, especially if you've read up to TLM, Elantris, and Warbreaker. The cosmere is getting smaller, and paths are crossing. It's all extremely exciting.

"B0826NKZHR","5","The best book since ""Way of Kings""","I was surprised by this book: I found ""Oathbringer"" to be over-long and bit dull, but this entry was a great read throughout. One of its core strengths is that, during its (lengthy) climactic chapters, the action isn't intermittently halted by jumping back to the (lower stakes) B-plot, as happens in some of the prior books. Instead that story is put on hiatus until the main action is resolved. There are some amazing, cinematic scenes in this volume, and some really rewarding character development. Some of the core POV characters fade into the background a bit so that several heretofore secondary characters (one in particular) really get the chance to shine, and it feels quite rewarding. The plot is also quite shocking at times, with one event in particular that absolutely blew me away, to the point that I had to put the book down and reflect on it for a while, muttering ""I can't believe that just happened!"" The story also deals with themes of mental health and PTSD in a way that felt very genuine and compassionate. This didn't drag the story, and it was more uplifting than depressing. This series' approach to warfare in general, and its humanization of all sides of the preeminate conflict, makes other fantasy series feel hollow and shallow by comparison. I really, really enjoyed this book, and I was sad to reach the end. This was certainly the best entry in the series since ""Way of Kings"", and IMO even surpassed that book in some regards. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first book. I'd also add that it will be more enjoyable if you preface this read by brushing up on the prior books first, even re-reading them entirely if you are so inclined. If you don't care to revisit the prior books, there is still sufficient ""recap"" here to refresh your memory (perhaps even if you've skipped one or two of them entirely) -- but this series certainly rewards those who pay close attention.","2022-01-25","United States","","true","30","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R276DNMY8KS56H"

"B0826NKZHR","3","Very long and ultimately unsatisfying","I know it is blasphemy to be critical of Brandon Sanderson’s work, but the last couple of Stormlight Archive books have fallen short for me. I generally love Sanderson’s books, but the last couple of installments and especially this last one feels bloated. The story progressed very slowly and there were what seemed like hundreds of pages of material that could have been omitted entirely without any impact on character development or storyline. I had the same complaint with many of Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time series after the fifth book and before Sanderson finished the series, and don’t even get me started on George R.R. Martin. It is almost like once an author becomes successful, the less editing takes place. There is no one to keep the author focused and encourage the progression of the story. It becomes bigger and bigger, more often than not, losing its focus with new threads and characters that bring very little value to the overall story. The ending was deeply unsatisfying, but since there are five more books to go, satisfaction may have to wait until 2039, when based on the time it took for the first five books to be completed we can expect the story to be finished.","2025-01-03","United States","","true","33","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26FS6BUY9D3QE"
"B0826NKZHR","5","... Wow!","When I first started The Way of Kings (Book 1) over a year ago, I couldn't get into it. I got to Kaladins intro scene and just felt lost. Had no idea who was who, and what was happening. I guess I just wasn't ready or something, because I just picked it back up and started at the beginning again about 2 weeks ago. I have now just finished Rhythm of War, and my mind is blown. Excellent writing. This particular book is a bit of a slog on some places (which, kind of annoyingly, aligns perfectly with the story and is appropriate to the tone and setting, thus bringing the reader into the story even more). This one is also a bit of an emotional Rollercoaster too, so hang on tight. But excellent, excellent, excellent!

"B0826NKZHR","5","My second favorite in the series","Rhythm of War starts off with a bang, which escalates into a tense situation that I found incredibly satisfying to watch unfold. RoW has a focused plot for such a large book. This is something Sanderson has always excelled at, though Oathbringer probably was the least focused in the series. Stormlight Archives manages to create an enjoyable singular experience for each book, while maintaining cohesion between entries, which is not the case for epics like The Wheel of Time or A Song of Ice and Fire, which often just end at a big event when the author runs out of pages. Thoughts on characters: (Sorry if I butcher the spelling of all these names. I listened to the audio.) - Getting to focus on Navani was a very welcome addition to the story. I found her to be a sympathetic character with a satisfying level of depths. Fabrial science is fascinating. - Shallan got a lot of focus at the start then disappeared for a bit. Her plotline was the most intriguing to me, and really kept me going through the story. She's become such a complex character and to me feels almost like a real person. One tiny downside to her story is that Pattern takes a backseat in this book because Shallan spends a lot of time inside her head(s). I love Pattern. He's so unintentionally funny, but he tries. - Kaladin is awesome as per usual. After his 'failure' at the end of book 3, he has to deal with growing feelings of depression and apathy. We get more interactions between him and his dad, which was an expert mix of catharsis and repulsion. He's kind of the total antithesis of Alethi culture, and Kaladin feels like a heathy mix of all the philosophies. I won't go into more detail so as to avoid spoilers, but in general, this book expands on everything we already know in the series, including the Listeners, stormlight, the radients, and Roshar. In terms of where it falls in the series, here's my rating for favorites: 1) Words of Radiance (My favorite book ever) 2) Rythm of War (great direction with existing characters) 3) The Way of Kings (that was a hard choice placing it here) 4) Oathbringer (it was good, but lacked focus.)","2020-11-30","United States","","true","35","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QDUN0HS2KEZP"
"B0826NKZHR","4","Good addition to the series, but...","Now, I don't want people to think I'm nitpicking here. If you've read the series this far, I think you are aware of what makes Mr. Sanderson's books interesting to read better than I could convey in this short review. So disclaimer, this review will deal with some criticism of RoW. There are warning signs here that things aren't perhaps as great as they could be, and I'll explain why. First is the 'long fantasy series' syndrome, where lost in details, books cover less and less ground with every new installment. Writers as great as Robert Jordan and George R. R. Martin have fell victim to it and Sanderson is starting to become no exception to it. The Stormlight Archive was never really a fast-paced series, to begin with, but it's getting worse. The entire book covers about a month, perhaps a month and a half. That doesn't seem too long for a grand war and it isn't. You spend the first hundred pages reading on what has happened in the time skip between books, and then are presented with plot points that will drag on through the entirety of RoW. There is also a strong suggestion (minor contextless spoiler ahead) that the next book will cover an even smaller timespan of a week or so. Second is the question of the characters themselves. If you didn't like the mental health issues that have been present since the first book, then you won't look forward to knowing they are here too. Mr. Sanderson's portrayal can be touching sometimes, the lack of character progression also feels frustrating, especially given how many pages go by focused solely on this. While this might seem realistic to some, I can't help but feel it romanticizes mental illness, with the unfortunate implication that, in-universe, these barely functional people were the best the spren could find, or are somehow special because of debilitating traits. Third, but and somewhat less important, is how Mr. Sanderson is starting to build this series into his 'Cosmere Avengers'. This might seem fine and even exciting to the people who can keep up with everything he has written so far, but many readers will increasingly come across things like the properties of the metals, Wit, or Szeth's sword, and lose crucial context of what is going on here.","2021-01-01","United States","","true","36","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4ZL7BON2P1IK"

"B0826NKZHR","3","Wheel of Time syndrome","Look, the ending is amazing. You know that. Navani's ending in particular is probably the most satisfying conclusion to a story arc in the series, or at least up there with the best. Kaladin comes in a close second, his payoff being marred by mixed messaging and having some of its thunder (no pun intended) taken away by one of the interlude chapters spoiling what would happen to him. Some of the other characters get good endings too, but this is where I have to point out my big problem with this book. Just like the Wheel of Time started doing around book 5, this series is beginning to more aggressively focus on characters who don't clearly tie in with the main plot. There are a few occasions where Sanderson shoehorns full storylines into a single chapter without any previous indication that said story matters (Dabbid deserves better dangit). You might argue that it's always been this way; book 1 started off with nothing but POV shifts for about five chapters straight. If you are the type of reader who likes that, enjoy. I for one stopped reading WoT because of gimmicks like this; there are only so many characters you can feel connected to when it only takes three to progress the main plot (in this case, Navani, Kaladin, and Venli), and all the others are largely about how the character thinks other cultures are “strange.” Side note, I wish these characters would stop thinking that. Yes, other people are strange to you. We get it. This is Wheel of Time skirt gate all over again. I'm also surprised that the man who teaches promises, progress, and payoffs manages to fumble the progress section of his book. Without spoiling anything, but also in an effort to save readers from the progress slog, this book opens with some spectacular scenes that promise the Knights Radiant will finally have big roles to play. Not so. We instead follow Venli, a side character of a side character in two of the previous books, on her quest to setup something interesting in the next book. Ironically, the most interesting parts of her story are the side characters she meets, namely a disenfranchised Fused who tows the line between enemy and friend until the very last minute. Know what to expect: Venli will be the subject of most of this book’s flashbacks, and her arc will amount to one literal paragraph of a touching scene. She is emblematic of this book’s shortcomings. I wish I could give this book higher praise. Oathbringer was something special, and I do think that the big moments in this title hit harder than the big moments in that. Spoilers ahead as I name-drop.a few of my favorite scenes: The human caterpillar attack during the invasion: 5 stars. Kaladin starting group therapy: 5 stars. Maya and Adolin fighting together: 5 stars. Maya's courtroom scene. Christ, I cried like a child: 6 stars, #MayaMVP. But big moments and payoffs don't make an interesting book.

"B0826NKZHR","5","There are some books out...","There are just some books out there that a review can't do justice. Rhythm of War is that particular book. It is a journey of plot and character development on a level I have never seen before. For one, the Stormlight Archive series has always had some of the tightest plot threads of any series I have ever read. Which makes it an overall compelling story. However with Rhythm of War Sanderson went, in my honest opinion, a different route. Yes this book still has a tight plot but where this book shines is that is extremely character driven. The characters were put through unimaginable hardships and journeys of self discovery. I have come to love these characters as if they were a part of my family and the fact that Sanderson decided to hurt my family is unacceptable. Totally joking, they are his characters and he can do what he pleases. There were many times I found myself wanting to jump into this novel and hug my family because they were going through so much. Rhythm of War is the penultimate installment before the big closing of the first arc in the Archive. I for one think Sanderson hit it out of the park. RoW exceeded all my expectations and has truly solidified its place as my favorite book of the year. Yes the year is not over and I will be reading more books. I am telling you now that no book will hit me like RoW did. I was totally going into this book expecting a great Sanderson avalanche ending and was surprised that it was not the case. That is not to say the ending wasn't great because it was everything Part 5 has to be one of the most pristine endings out of all Stormlight books. It just had so much power and raw emotion. Sanderson has laid the foundation of what is going to be one epic, harrowing conclusion to arc one of the Archive.

"B0826NKZHR","4","Meaty and awesome!","I really enjoyed this book. This book feels like a middle book, but I need to clarify a few things. Middle books can either build the world and tension to a story so that the anticipation for the last book is palpable or a middle book can feel like a slog that you have to tread through to get to what you want. This book is the first of the two. I thought the character development and progression was amazing. You have three main groups that you follow throughout. One group deals with issues in Shadesmar, one group deals with issues at Urithiru, and the final group deals with the war front. Oathbringer suffered at its Shadesmar section. This book improves that this go around. The sequence in Shadesmar is engaging and moves at a better pace. Standout characters for me were Raboniel, Kaladin, and Navani. The arc with Navani and Raboniel had me burning through the pages of this behemoth of a book. This book I would say is definitely Cosmere heavy. There are a lot of nods and Easter eggs. They range from rewarding fans of Sanderson’s work to pretty significant tie ins. You should really be reading more than just the Stormlight archive to get everything by this point. Sanderson’s writing has only improved with time. You are going to be in for the ride or a lifetime. You go through the full spectrum of human emotion in this book. It has everything you want in a great fantasy epic. It did not disappoint. The only negative for me is that I didn’t connect with some of the characters as much as previous entries. Particularly this books flashback character/s. Shallan isn’t one of my favorites, but I came to understand and appreciate her a lot more from seeing her flashback sequence in Words of Radiance. That is what a good flashback sequence can do. It’s makes you understand or appreciate characters who weren’t your favorite to begin with. This book I didn’t feel that for Venli and Eshonai.","2020-12-04","United States","","true","43","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BZ2B2USYO8MN"

Hard to review without spoilers, so I'll just say - now that the fundamentals of the series seem to be well established, the progression of the story is particularly well paced and rewarding.

"B0826NKZHR","4","Classic epic Sanderson twists, but be prepared to slog through sometimes....","I love this series of all the Sanderson series the best (Skyward is probably my second favorite) and reread the first three books last year so I was ready for this when it came out. It has AMAZING epic moments in it that I love Sanderson for, but there is so much inner turmoil, mental anxiety, etc. that it really weighs the book down in a bad way. It's not just once in awhile, it's constant. I had to put it down for a bit, read some other stuff, and then gear up to finish it, which I never did with the first three book. Spoiler alert, there's a scene where Kaladin sits down in an ""AA"" type meeting with a cup of tea to talk out his feelings. I laughed at this because it seemed so out of place in this kind of book. I don't understand the long meandering chapters that are all about the character's mental health. It just takes up way too much space and I found myself skimming through a lot of the sections. It's not bad to have this in a book but it was the same thing over and over and it gets really tiring. This felt like a bridge book--good to read to get to the next book but not something to cherish like some of his other works. I'm sure I'll reread it someday as I wait another year (or two or three!) for the next installment. I give it 4 stars because I love Sanderson and he is a genius and he works soooooo hard on his writing so I know he put so much effort and heart into this work but it isn't as awe-inspiring to me as the first three books. Those are pure gold and this is a silver with a bit of dross on it.","2021-04-24","United States","","true","46","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PO88AU6BH3O8"

"B0826NKZHR","3","Very angsty","I didn't know what to expect but I was really looking forward to this book since this is one of the best series out right now but all I got out of this is frustration. It almost reads like a self help book about how every character feels sorry for themselves. I can understand since I served 5 years in the USMC and I have my dark days too but the characters go on large monologues that turn into tangents with hardly any action. It hard to take some of the angst to heart because at the end of the day most are good looking people with phenomenal skills. I understand that being good looking or being good at something doesn't stop depression or other mental illnesses but as a person who really suffers from depression and doesn't go a day without thinking of the people I have seen die it is aggravating to read. It comes off as preachy and I assumed we were moving forward with the Radiants. I assumed they were going to finally become stronger but they actually deteriorate with their loathing. They haven't become stronger, they have become weaker. I was extremely disappointed with Kaladin's role in this book. In a lot of ways I can relate to him but the thing I liked most about him was that he was the man I always inspired to be while I was in the military. I know Sanderson wanted to make him realistic but all it did was make my depression worse. Kaladin has his moments but they hardly outshine the rest. Kaladin was at his worst in this book and I have lost most of my inspiration and faith in him. This leads me to Kaladin's father-Lirin. He's a typical anti war persona and at times I can find people like that admirable but he just comes off as a bootlicker with no standards willing to bow to anyone as long as there is no fighting. Then again he is the father who let his sons get stomped on and sent to war without much bickering, so I honestly shouldn't expect much from him. I wouldn't be surprised if Lirin would not make a fuss if his wife was taken by some noble. Shallan is interesting and I like her but her tangents went on far too long in this book. I'm actually shocked none of the beta readers took a step back to address some of the useless monologues she had and tried to cut it down. Adolin was the most interesting character in this book and I could go on about it but I don't want to spoil anything. I'm on the fence about continuing this series.

"B0826NKZHR","4","A Step Down from the Rest of the Series","This doorstopper oozes the DNA of the rest of the series. Illustrations litter the book, familiar characters return, flashbacks that follow a singular character populate the different parts, and quotations kick off each chapter. Yet, at times it seems that there was a rush to complete the book and some refinement was lost. The first couple hundred pages are a setup for the rest of the book and drag at times. Little action occurs as the characters spend time brooding and another portion is spent catching the reader up with what happened in the year since Oathbringer ended. The final one hundred pages almost match this by setting up cliffhangers for the next book to resolve. The nine hundred pages in between do ignite a certain satisfaction. Roshar rushes to life again and the characters are faced with dilemmas. The reader is also given an opportunity to reflect on the virtues of both sides of the war. Yet, the world doesn't seem to be expanded as much as in previous books. The interludes, for example, focus much more on the characters that are already being followed albeit from a slightly different point of view, rather than entirely different parts of the world. The book also has some logic holes. Much of the story occurs within Urithiru. Yet, the people who rule the tower never seem to be able to do simple things such as follow suspected moles. The decisions at the end that lead to the climax also beg some questions as to whether those decisions would really be made. With all that said, for Sanderson and Roshar fans, the book is worth the large investment of time. Although not as fulfilling, it reads easily and continues one of the great modern epics.","2020-12-20","United States","","true","52","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REGITQHL7D1II"

"B0826NKZHR","5","Slower paced with an insane ending","Brandon tends to slow his pace often in the previous books and then throw together some action at certain points throughout the narrative. This book falls out from this pattern on several occasions. It runs a bit slow, trying to go deeper into all of the protagonists development, and it does seem for a long time a little bit of a drag and even tiresome. It can be hard to follow at times, a plot that keeps building up, story seems to choke you as you would expect some events to happen to lift from the characters some of the drama they are forced to go through, but it does not happen until you reach about 90% of the book. If you make it towards the end, you are rewarded with a rush of events, twists and turns that will leave your mind blown. It's true, the book could have been shortened a quite a bit, reducing the amount of intrigue and adding more action but it feels a bit of a set-up for Book 5. I recommend to anyone preparing to read this chapter, to approach it with patience, open mind, because Sanderson appears to be adding some background stories to the characters before plunging into - what I can only expect at this point - an insane, action packed finale. Little Spoiler! And one last thing - At the end of the book a Seon appears. Is this related to Elantris????? Anyway, it keeps me on the toes - ""Like a splinter in my mind"" - especially because it seems to be like the ones in Elantris!","2021-01-06","United States","","true","58","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNLEX46LK23Y8"

Due to a slow start at the beginning of the book, I felt it difficult to keep my attention, but once I picked it back up again, I was so pleased! I felt there was enough foreshadowing to keep my mind constantly guessing, and many previous items that seemed to lead nowhere, were clearly fleshed out and provided some closure to some long nagging questions. This book was a bit darker than previous installments, but we received some huge revelations, and if you were paying attention closely, you got excited with theories and intrigue well before the end of the book! I will say, I would have liked more Jasnah, Lift and Renarin. There is a lot going on there with those behind the scenes that are making me go crazy with speculation! The flashback chapters definitely played a large role in tying up loose ends of different perspectives throughout the series, and the interludes were definitely interesting to say the least.

"B0826NKZHR","5","Not a perfect book, but pretty darn close","Brandon is juggling so many balls with the Stormlight Archive (not to mention the cosmere), and while this isn’t a ‘perfect’ book, it is truly astounding, and deserves 5 stars. - He fleshes out and gives respect to so many cultures within the Rosharan system, and anytime you might be tempted to think that it’s safe to say that ‘they’ are all evil, Brandon goes and shows that no one has a monopoly on morality. - His exploration of science with magic almost makes my brain hurt, but it’s exciting all the same. - Sword-nimi is the best, especially when listening to the audiobook depiction. Also a couple certain Cryptic Spren... - How awesome is it to see people of so many ages, abilities, genders, and color getting to be a hero??? - He spends SO much time discussing a HUGE variety of people with disabilities, both mental and physical: PTSD, depression, anxiety, addiction, dissociative personality disorder, brain damage from birth complications, paralysis, missing limbs... and it’s not just ONE person representing each thing listed. It’s exciting to see the representation, and I want to press this series (ie MASSIVE TOMES) into so many friends’ and family members’ hands. Of the 4 full books in the Stormlight Archive, this book is perhaps a bit clunkier when juggling the MANY perspectives Brandon has available to write from, but I respect his choices and am excited (though a bit fearful, given some of the ominous promises near the end of the book) for Book 5.

"B0826NKZHR","3","Sad","Journey before destination. A key thing in the series thus far and it makes me sad that Sanderson did not take that to heart in writing this book. The end being really good does not make up for the meat of the book being disjointed and not fun. It is not a bad book in the grand scheme of things, but it IS a bad book in comparison to the other Archive books. The vast majority of characters we see repeat themes from the previous books. Mental health is a major thing in this book both to its credit and detriment. I understand it is a constant struggle for many people but I feel as though that very constant struggle hurts the book. There just seemed to be very little progress in the book. It would be one thing if it was at least fun to read but that was not really the case. It more depressing and dark than previous books especially adding in the mental health bits. The flow of the story was constantly interrupted, mainly by flashbacks. Flashbacks that added nothing into the story of any relevance. This was easily my favorite series that I was reading, I looked forward to each release. In the previous books I found myself reading constantly with as few interruptions as I could. This book was not like that. With this one I found myself putting it down to do other things, especially when one of the aforementioned flashback chapters came up. This book combined with Sanderson saying he plans on this being a 10 book series divided into two 5 books parts leaves me sad, disappointed and worried going forward.","2020-11-22","United States","","true","63","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LN6V3604V2BY"
"B0826NKZHR","3","Dragged down by weak supporting characters. Lots of skimming.","I wrote another review, but wanted to be a bit more concise. * I love Brandon Sanderson stories, but RoW falls into the same trap as many fantasy series that drag on past 3 books. * I'd only recommend this book to those readers who are very Invested in The Cosmere. It basically has The Architect scene from The Matrix strung out through much of the book. * Shallan, Navani and Venli are interesting characters. Wit's always good and I could've read more chapters about The Mink. Dalinar and Jasnah are just kind of there. Lift is awesome, but she's lost in the shuffle. Lirin (Kaladin) and Adolin drag down the entire book. * RoW should've been the first book in a new trilogy. As book #4 in the Archive, it's about 400-600 pages too long. Sanderson should have just included Dawnshard if he needed 1200 pages for publication. Additional Notes: 1. Lirin drags down all the Kaladin chapters and eventually the entire book. His character is so flat that it's nearly impossible to read his and Kaladin's chapters. Point made after 2 chapters. Time to move on. 2. Adolin drags down all of Shallan's chapters. The whining gets incredibly old after a very short period of time. Got the gist 2 books ago. 3. The interludes aren't needed. They're either a PoV for a character in the main story arc (should've been a chapter) or too short to add anything to the world. For example, I-8 adds very little and that's a stretch unless you've read Dawnshard. 4. It feels like there are too many facts not in evidence. I've read the 6 Mistborn books, Unbounded and Dawnshard. I still feel like I had to buy and read Warbreaker about mid way through reading RoW. Didn't help, which wasn't a great feeling. RoW would be especially confusing without Unbounded and coppermind.net (fair warning, coppermind has many RoW spoilers in addition to other useful information. The best books are the ones you can reread and still enjoy after knowing everything though).","2020-11-29","United States","","true","64","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D8J25P3L01CW"
"B0826NKZHR","5","Rhythm of War by Brandon Sanders is another outstanding book in The Stormlight Archive series.","In Rhythm of War by Brandon Sanderson, the war continues between the human forces of the Stormfather and the Voidbringer forces of Odium. The Voidbringers have taken the kingdom of Alethkar, and the humans have retreated to the stronghold of Urithru. Dalinar Kholin leads humans and must decide where he should attack. Their strength is fading, and he must make the right decision or fail, leading to their destruction. Kaladin faces PTSD and must conquer great physical challenges to save them all. Will the forces of the Stormfather succeed or perish? Rhythm of War by Brandon Sanders is another outstanding book in The Stormlight Archive series. The book expands on the first three books and intensifies the conflict. The reader learns more about how Eshonai became the leader of the Parshendi and how Venli learned new forms which lead to the coming of the Voidbringers. Dalinar becomes a supreme war leader. Kaladin faces his biggest challenges yet. Navani faces an interesting dilemma concerning if you should help your captor if the help you provide could prove your downfall. Shallan deals with her multiple personalities and her relationship with Adolin. The flashback character for book 5 is for Szeth-son-son-Vallano, and that should prove interesting. Books one to five are a division of the series, and a significant event should occur at the end of the next book. This series continues to amaze me, and I look forward to reading the next book and the following group of five volumes in the coming years.","2020-12-31","United States","","true","65","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R74ORW1JKZIR"
"B0826NKZHR","4","Really Wanted to Give This 5 Stars But...","There are SO many amazing things about this book, that I hate to give it 4 stars. If you've been wanting more depth and information about the Cosmere, you'll love many of the scenes in this book. If you've had questions about Stormlight and the magic system, you'll love Navani's chapters (she was the POV I was most worried about reading and has easily become one of my favorite new POVs). Taravangian has been a very interesting character to me and he has some great chapters as well. But - if you hated Shallan's split personality chapters in Oathbringer (like I did), you're going to be sorely disappointed when you find out that character arc is back and worse than ever. I skimmed so many of Shallan's chapters that could have easily been summarized as ""Shallan argues with her alter egos and accomplishes nothing"". Both Shallan and Kaladin have basically their same character arcs from Oathbringer which is very frustrating to read. Venli's flashbacks are totally pointless and I skimmed most of those chapters as well. If Shallan and Kaladin had moved past the same issues from last book, this book would have been 5 stars. It's particularly infuriating when you can see where these arcs are going, and it's just 500+ pages of build up to their hopeful resolution. Lots of answers to questions, excellent climax as usual for Sanderson. If you love Sanderson and have loved the Stormlight archive you have to read this book.

Shallan is the same psychotic girl with multi personality disorder. She just drones on about her past and still can’t decide who the hell she is. Seems like she’s always a character with problems in her past... alright, we get it. I don’t need a large portion of multiple books explaining how she’s crazy. I’d much rather see the story advance. Kaladin is battling mental health issues as well, but at least he makes some progress and builds on this side of himself. Then, we’re subjected through (something like) 10% of the book just talking about music and noise and rhythms... id just take a music class if I wanted to learn about this stuff. Really a lot of this book just seems like filler. It seems like he built on characters he didn’t really need to, and that didn’t advance the story. Maybe these characters will in subsequent books, but for now it seemed like filler. The book was great for about the first 20%, then steadily evened through 50%. Then from 50% through around 88% it was sloooooow. Then it finally picked up at the very end. In a book of this size, that equates to a lot of reading that just was that engaging.

"B0826NKZHR","4","Great, but flawed.","I'm tempted to bump it up to five stars, but there are flaws. Overall, it's a great addition to the cosmere as a whole and really starts to set up future interactions and explain past interactions between the different worlds. This book is very science heavy. There's a lot of discovering new things and explaining them to the reader. As a Physics nerd, I always enjoy these bits in Sanderson's books and I think it's written particularly well here, but it could wear you down if that's not your thing. Having finished the book, it feels a little like he made a list of where he wanted certain characters to be at the end and then wrote that. As a consequence, some characters don't do much, while others get chapter after chapter with a few important moments where the character development comes together kinda quickly. As usual, after the climax of the book, there are quite a few chapters that feel like post credits scenes, quickly tying up all the plot threads and setting up for the next book. This has the effect of making the end of each chapter feel like the end of the book until the next chapter starts and the cycle repeats. This seems negative, I know, but you probably know what you're getting here. As always, there's lots happening, lots to learn, lots of satisfying moments that feel like the culmination of a half dozen other books, and lots of mind bending twists. It's a fantastic book and I recommend it, but it does feel flawed.","2020-11-21","United States","","true","69","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E1PGH3NCY113"

"B0826NKZHR","5","Feels like his “Two Towers”","This book, like his previous Stormlight Archive books, is such a literary roller coaster. Like a roller coaster strains as it rises slowly, the protagonists struggle to progress. And just like a roller coaster quickly twists and turns and loops, the story does the same to your emotions. The prognosis is that book 5 will be a tumultuous end of an era on Roshar before making a major time skip to the second half of the series. If that is the case, then book 4 of The Stormlight Archive is the ominous setup to the potentially world rending events set in place. While there is a big victory at the end like in his previous books, you can feel a significant sense of foreboding at the events to come. Just like how the Battle of Helms deep was a victory in Lord of the Rings, the fate of the world was still far from peace. A big appreciation to the author for always striving to tell people that it’s ok to be broken and that we are worth fixing. Also that human connection is a big part in healing. I applaud his consulting with others on how to better represent certain mental health conditions. His radiants are like a form of spiritual kintsugi, broken, but put back together in a way that shows it was broken while progressing to something greater.","2020-12-10","United States","","true","75","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R5XSY5MK5UF5"
"B0826NKZHR","2","I'm a huge Sanderson fan and a huge Stormlight fan...BUT...","I think Brandon Sanderson may have trouble sticking with a single tone, consistent main character, and thus gets lost in his own explorations. He repeats the same crisis over-and-over, meaning the prior successes and resolutions lose significance. It becomes more of a ""soap opera"" than a drama. I love Stormlight Archives, largely from the mix of action and character development of Kaladin. I think Brandon is bored with Kaladin. From his viewpoint, he's probably hoping to ""develop him further"", but in the process he loses what I liked about him. You'll read in other reviews, mental health becomes THE central theme in this novel. I'm a physician, I'm interested in the topic, but not overwhelming my fantasy. SPOILERS SPOILERS BELOW So, for instance, Dalinar struggled with one particular mental health issue - alcoholism. He overcame it and now is becoming the main character. In this book, towards the end, he's clearly the central character. Kaladin, on the other hand, keeps repeating his battle with depression. He made a huge stride at the end of this one...but he's made a huge stride before, but was right back into the crisis and hopeless to the point of suicide here. In the end, despite not dying and even swearing a new ideal, he's changed professions. Dalinar characterizes him as ""not the greatest warrior, but a good soldier"" and not his pick of champion. Ok, so Kaladin isn't central anymore...if he's my favorite character, what motivation do I have to keep reading? I feel like I did when I identified with characters in GRR Martin's work and he killed them. Fine, you killed my character, but you also killed my interest. Shallan has never really interested me. I skip her stuff. It's ok, but she's more annoying than interesting to me and continues so. Perhaps a different series with her as the main character, but that's not how he writes. The deal at the end makes Wit look stupid. There's going to be a final fight in 10 days. Only, I don't care anymore. I know we're just going to repeat the same struggles over and over. The mysteries...the Cosmere world building...were interesting to me, but I begin to realize it's like Lost, the tv series. The mysteries are interesting, but the resolutions are going to be dissatisfying and therefore not worth investing this much in. Who is Wit/Hoid? Well, he's an idiot that gets worked, so why do I care? Just one ""for instance"". The series began as fairly straightforward. Good/evil and more recently Humans/Parshmen. In this book, some of the Parshmen/Singers become radiants and are ""good"", so now I have to keep track of even more indistinguishable characters with obscure motivations. Good night...can I have another 1000 pages that should have been edited? No, thank you. So, I've lost most of my interest. It's just going in circles without much direction. Soap operas and comic books do that...maybe they'll bring back Phoenix. Maybe she'll die again. Once I stop caring, it's hard to re-start.","2020-12-02","United States","","true","76","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROWM73XY3VI4O"

This book has some great moments but there are about 800 pages here where the author takes the reader down tangents that appear to be important then drops them almost completely except for a few pages of wrap up at the end. Also, spending hundreds of pages on two main characters mental health issues becomes gratuitous as there is almost no new ground covered until the inevitable breakthrough in the last few chapters. Sanderson is in desperate need of a strong editor who can rein him in and bring much needed focus to his work.","2023-12-02","United States","","true","78","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UKY4MOQXOLST"

Newly emerged, and a direct consequence of the modern news cycle, and the fact that majority of my reading is based on blogs and opinion pieces, but it is getting really hard to keep track of characters and concepts on a years long journey with the author's vision. Rhythm of War falls as unfortunate prey to that - not only does it require to pay attention to a roster of characters that has grown unwieldy in the past three books - it also requires you to be clued in the general mythology if Sanderson's works, and the way the Universe of Cosmere interacts between different itirations of the Shards of Adolnasium concept. It is wearing to read, and while still quite quality, and I will finish the next one, I shall do so out of stubborn pride and completionist sense, and not because I still derive enjoyment from the work. On the other hand, the book did provide me with desire to write this review, and few others have provided the same impetus lately, so there is value to the text and it will leave a reader with something to think about.","2021-11-08","United States","","true","80","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ET570ZWR78ZU"

Halfway thru the book I thought I could see where the buildup was going - but no - I was again thrown by his creative vision. Sanderson's world-building skills, combined with extensive character evolution, drive the action ever forward in this 4th volume of the The Stormlight Archives. In this narrative - taking place in the mounting War crisis - we are treated to not just action sequences but also deep-dives into characters on both sides of the conflict, featuring insights into the societal differences that separate the two . These strong immersive sequences sit side-by-each with the unexpectedly tender dialogues between husbands and wives, fireside camaraderie of warriors taking a moment to bond over stew, and the all-to-real depictions of characters dealing with the mental strain that war will inflict on the participants as well as those who wait. According to the author the series has one more entry - then a second 5 volume Arc. Apparently I have to track down the Doctor because I simply do not want to wait that long!

That is not the cast the Sanderson. However, Oath Bringer was very weak for me. I had a very had time getting through it. So, I was very happy to discover that Rhythm of War is back to a five star offering with way fewer tedious sections. The only thing to say negative is ""how can i possibly keep up with all of the characters and what they are doing, and why oh why do you randomly through in side stories that advance the world but seem to have little to do with the story until 2 books later.

I love most of the characters (not you, Shallan) and I have been so engrossed in the story but this book just felt too much of a platform to me. I read fantasy to escape from the crappy details of real life. In the other books, I enjoyed that Kaladin and Shallan were dealing with mental health issues that felt real and relatable but this book took it a bit far, in my opinion. I wish that fantasy authors would stop using their books as a platform to increase awareness of mental health issues. That's not why we read your stuff, we read to get away from all that! However, the story was excellently written and I enjoyed getting to know Navani and Adolin a bit better.","2022-10-20","United States","","true","89","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VWN6QM5QKT79"

"B0826NKZHR","1","More interested in minutiae and mental health backpats than being an entertaining read","This books spends way, WAY too much time on two things that are simply not fun: endless backstory with a very minor payoff, and unrelenting mental health problems. I almost didn't finish it. I'm not sure I'll read the next one. There was way too much ink spent on history for characters we already know are dead, shown in numerous flashback chapters. The payoff for all that was that a few little dots got connected, but nothing that really changes anything about the plot. Those chapters were mostly tiresome, plodding, dull, and entirely forgettable. I have a friend who knows all sorts of stuff about the Cosmere and he explained how, no, it was actually interesting because this person was that, and that person was this other guy, and look, these two things are related, but honestly, screw all that. It was boring and took up way too much of the book. Aside from too many very boring chapters, the second problem was the mental health nonsense. Places throughout the book where we could have spent time being adventurous and awesome and doing cool things, we spent time whining about our mental issues and not being entertaining. Shallan is not a fun character. She is basically static, personality-wise, from her appearance two books ago. She's nuts, and she's so nuts that it messes with people around her. But instead of any sort of human reaction to someone who is unrelentingly crazy and generally unlikeable, everyone she encounters goes out of their way to pat her on the back and tell her she's great, and they support her. EVERYBODY. Not only is she an unpleasant, unlikeable, and tedious character, but I feel like how everyone treats her shows the book went through a giant Wokeness and Affirmation committee to turn it into propaganda. I honestly can't even like Adolin anymore because he's such a pathetic simp. I used to like him. I had hope for their romance. But no, this is embarrassing. Have some self respect, dude. Then there's Kaladin, who is an obnoxious, mopey loser that everyone also adores unflinchingly (except his dad, because who WOULD like a son who is one of the most achieved and respected people on the planet). This is the 4th book in which he has an arc that goes ""I need to do a thing but I'm sad. Oh well I guess I'll do it while being sad. I did it, and now I'm sad."" Seriously, F this guy. Am I supposed to sympathize with this? To say nothing of taking the main Adventure Guy in the book and giving him PTSD and having a whole arc about improving the treatment of patients in asylums. I was promised aerial sword combat awesomeness and there was precious little of that. In short, previous Sanderson books were adventurous and fresh. They had sympathetic characters in cool situations doing cool things. You could describe them as exciting, inventive, compelling. The word for this book is ""Safe"", as in a safe space for really touchy left-wing people. If you're not fully committed to the series, skip it for now and see how the 5th book goes, because if something doesn't change quite a bit, this whole series is ruined.","2021-03-30","United States","","true","93","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EH7YJZ0UUJ6S"

"B0826NKZHR","5","Top tier modern fantasy","Rhythm of War is worthy of being the 4th book in a series that has already garnered much praise for its breathtaking world, heart pounding action, and relatable and interesting characters. The characters (especially Kaladin) reach new depths, the action (especially the beginning and end) is visceral, and the world (more like universe) is ever an ever expanding joy to behold. While some longtime fans might find the “flashback” sequences to be less engaging than Oathbringer’s it still manages to connect to the story of one of the characters fairly well while also enticing die hard cosmere fans with its hints of wider implications that go beyond Roshar. It should also be noted that Dalinar does take a bit of a backseat in this book, but where they leave his story at the end of the book indicates to me that Stormlight 5 will rectify anyone’s complaints about the lack of Dalinar in Rhythm of War. While it might not be my favorite book in the series it certainly isn’t anything but amazing.

"B0826NKZHR","3","Disappointing merry-go-round of mental health issues","If you didn't have enough of Kaladin and his issues in the earlier books, you're in luck. He'll spend most of this book wallowing in depression, and it doesn't get much better. Shallan will continue her identity crisis, again for the entire story. The same for a bunch of other characters, 1230 pages worth of waiting for them to get over it. I am autistic and have suffered depression my whole life. Reading a fantasy book is literally about escapism, and I'm not particularly thrilled to get bludgeoned over the head with the exact problems I'm trying to get a break from in what is supposed to be an epic series by my favorite author. At 50% finished, I realized I didn't even want to finish this book. It's twice as long as it needed to be, filler that serves to force character development to a degree that is extremely annoying and doesn't seem necessary. But I've read all the other Cosmere books and read each of the Stormlight books twice, so it's basically impossible to abandon it after getting this far. The whole Lady of Wishes & Navini deal feels forced to provide the conclusion Sanderson wanted. The Lady has ridiculous intuitive ability, and Navini acts dumb as a rock sometimes, repeatedly falling for the same lies like an idiot. Frankly, Gavilar was right about her. I couldn't suspend my disbelief on these two. Then there's my most hated writer mechanic, the repetitive flashback sequences. Yeah, this isn't new but I'm sick of it. I really don't care about Venli or her arc. I found myself doing something I rarely do with a book; skimming. Through the flashbacks, through the pointless bantering and eye rolling introspection that covers pages. I regret buying this book. I'll have to read the next one with how much Investiture I have into the series, but I'll be getting it from the library.","2020-12-05","United States","","true","100","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RH4B0C48H97QE"
