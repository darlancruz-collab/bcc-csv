"B000QCS8TW","5","Let the Games Begin","If you're going to consider reading `The Song of Ice and Fire' series, then be prepared for an investment. These books aren't for casual readers, but rather slower and more methodical ones. Requiring a great deal of your time, attention to detail, and the memorization of various characters' political and social associations. The amount of content the book contains is equal to the level of commitment you are willing to give. This may sound intimidating to some people, but Games of Thrones is able to deliver a very deep story targeting a mature audience because of this, though this also means the book's level of comprehension and adult content may become a deal-breaker to some people. Persevere and you'll enjoy one of the best fantasy epics in quite some time. As I previously said, the narrative of A Game of Thrones can be quite cumbersome to comprehend at the very beginning, and the faint synopsis doesn't exactly paint a very big picture of what's to come. So I've decided to provide a brief synopsis of my own. With the murder of King Robert Baratheon's Hand `Jon Aryn', his Majesty himself has requested that his old friend Eddard Stark, head of House Stark take up the role at his side in King's Landing to help him properly govern the realm. Of course taking up this honorable task would mean Eddard, `Ned' must leave the sanctity of Winterfell and his family. But he soon realizes that treachery and deception have consumed the nobility, no one can be trusted, everyone is trying to seize power by any means necessary; particularly the cunning Lannister family. The book doesn't just follow the character Ned, but rather a large collection of personas, some intertwine with the central story arc involving Ned, others involve their own. Daenerys Targaryen, one of the last of the feared House Targaryen, is forced into a marriage with a savage Dothraki warlord in order to gain in army for the means of reconquering her rightful throne. The last major story arc involves Ned's bastard son `Jon Snow' and his indoctrination in the enigmatic `Night's Watch', where desertion is punishable by death. While the plot of A Game of Thrones is truly an epic piece of fiction-writing, it would be nothing if the characters weren't believable. George R. R. Martin has established himself as a very strong character-driven author, one who focuses on the problems of these people and how they affect them. While there are characters which are not affiliated with Eddard Stark, the majority of the major characters can be allocated into the two major noble families: the Starks and the Lannisters. The Starks characterize honor, duty, diligence, and integrity, making them the primary protagonists. They're opposed by the ambitiously materialistic Lannister family, who seem like Martin's equivalent of the Borgia's. Though if there's a weakness in the characterization department, it would be that not enough is done with characterizing the Lannister family. The Stark family makes up the bulk of the story's protagonists, but they aren't exactly perfect. They can be rude, selfish, jealous, and even bratty at times, they're delightfully flawed characters. With the exception of the great character `Tyrion Lannister', we're given very little insight into the life of the family aside from their obvious immoral tendencies. The Lannisters, while morally vague, come off feeling much less defined. I really wish more could have been done with them when compared to the excellently characterized Stark family. In a seemingly endless miasma of betrayal and deceit, the only beacon of hope comes in the form of family. The Starks, particularly the Stark children felt like the real heart of the book for me. Their precious innocence helps invest the reader in the story even further, especially since they're among the victims in this malicious game that the adults are playing. It only reinforces the insurmountable stakes and that nobody is truly safe or completely innocent. Even the world itself feels like a character that helps ground the reader in the author's fiction. Martin's `Seven Kingdoms' are vividly brought to life with intricate detail that makes it really pop off the pages. Its geography, political structure, and the dominant noble houses are all elaborated upon in surreal detail that really gives the reader a feeling of place. Less reliance on more fantastical elements like elves and dwarves gives Martin's world a pinch of reality that most authors tend to avoid. With the exception of the `White Walkers' and the extinct dragons, all mystical aspects are kept at an all-time low, favoring words and steel over mysticism and spells. The outcome is a fantasy world that surprisingly, comes off as genuinely plausible. The Seven Kingdoms feels like a realm that very much could have existed. It's an interesting divergence from the typical high fantasy settings. There's going to be the inevitable comparison between Martin's work and the legacy left behind by Tolkien as the great forefather of fantasy writing. The notion of comparing the two is entirely misguided, simply because Martin's writing is completely different from Tolkien's in nearly every angle. Tolkien emphasized the ongoing struggle between good and evil, the thrill of high adventure in a fantastical world, and the triumph of great heroes over terrible villains who would do the world harm. Martin on the other hand is much less black and white with his delivery. There are obvious characters you can label as `dishonorable', while others stand atop a pedestal as paragons of altruism. But are these characters truly evil for trying to secure the benefit of their family and future generations to come? And are these characters considered good if they're ensuring the stability of the realm by dishonest methods? Martin chose to forgo typical fantasy conventions of magic and obvious morality in the favor of characters who feel genuinely believable in all the most despicable ways. They're not the great heroes Tolkien illustrated; they're morally ambiguous human beings. That's the defining characteristic which separates these two giants of fantasy, the selfless heroes and the morally grey humans. Comparing these two juggernauts is completely irrelevant, for Martin isn't trying to replicate Tolkien but rather make his own beast. Yet, I never like to jump on a bandwagon and proclaim with the rest of the world that a novel is absolutely perfect. Of course these critiques are personal ones and admittedly border on flat-out nitpicking. The first is the absolutely insane overabundance of minor characters. I'm not referring to the central characters that the various chapters shift between; they're all perfectly characterized and fascinating. I'm referring to the endless onslaught of characters that overcrowd the book, but serve little importance in the greater scheme of things. Every story arc is jam-packed with so many characters that range from semi-important to useless. I usually wouldn't mention this, but with a book of this magnitude it really became an issue with me, though it may not for other people. The second issue is the lack of a proper climax to the story. I'm all for having an intriguing plot over a mindless slog of action scenes, but with a book of this size, it would have been nice to have it end with a bang. It's little things like these that stand out when the rest of the book is just so good. When Hollywood absolutely bastardized the final Harry Potter novel by splitting it into two movies in order to fill their glutinous craving for money; I became somewhat of a skeptic to segmenting visual adaptations of popular literature. Creating a television show made me raise an eyebrow, ""instead of making a movie they're going to milk it with a whole season of episodes"" I thought. After reading A Game of Thrones, I realized that making a television show out of the book isn't just a good idea, it's absolutely mandatory. This book and its sequels have so much content in them that a movie would never do the plot and its various characters justice. It's the perfect source material for an epic fantasy television series, which is great considering we don't exactly have many of those. A Game of Thrones is the start of something special. The beginning chapter of an epic tale that needs to be read by everyone of age who can truly appreciate its complexity. Read the book first before you watch the show, only then can you truly appreciate George R. R. Martin's natural talent for weaving such incredible stories.","2012-06-26","United States","","true","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22WKZXOADL7AN"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Refreshing and Edgy with Great Characters","I love fantasy; ever since I was a kid, stories set in creative worlds featuring varied groups of characters fighting to save the world, overcome evil, or even resolve some political matter have always captivated me. As such, I've read many fantasy novels over the years...and doing so has made me notice a rather unfortunate trend: the genre as a whole often relies too heavily on the same cliches and plots, which makes many of the stories presented seem tired, predictable, and overdone. As a result of this, I decided to take a break from fantasy; one can only read the same story so many times before getting fed up. I started ""A Game of Thrones"" very tentatively, partially because of the all the hype around the series and partially due to my own wariness regarding fantasy novels. My fears were completely unfounded; ""A Game of Thrones"" is a breath of fresh air for the genre, and is easily one of the best books I've read in recent years. Spoilers follow. The novel contains three story lines. The first and most heavily focused on is that of the Kingdom of Westeros, its political structure, the ruling family's potentially reputation-destroying secret, and the beginning of conflict after the king dies. The second plot is that of the Wall and the constant struggle of the Night Watch to defend Westeros against the wildlings and more sinister creatures that reside beyond the Kingdom's border. The third takes place away from Westeros and follows the story of Daenerys, the last of the Targaryen family, and the start of her rise to power. The first story is clearly the main plot, while the second and third receive a little less attention, yet are no less important to the overall story. The story presented here isn't that which is typically found in your common fantasy fare. This is not a tale of sword and sorcery, wizards and heroes enacting the traditional yarn of Good versus Evil, or of an impoverished farm boy discovering that he comes from a lofty background and is destined for greatness. Instead, this is largely about politics and political intrigue with a dash of magic and the unknown thrown in to give the novel a unique flavour. Perhaps the most noticeable element of the plot when compared to other fantasy books is the lack of magic; it does exist in Martin's world and he indicates that it can be a very powerful force, yet its role in this particular book is very small. This makes the few instances where it does appear very significant. Martin has said that he based ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" on the War of the Roses, and as such, more attention is given to the politics and the crisis of succession when Westeros' king dies. This makes for a story that avoids the traditional fantasy cliches while still having a distinctly fantasy feel. The primary focus may be on political intrigue, but the book is hardly boring or overly mired solely in scheming. With all this political conflict come battles, fights, beheadings, and conquest, and Martin writes all of them exceedingly well and believably. This is a very gritty world that Martin has created, and he certainly doesn't shy away from showing how brutal life can be for his characters. Both rape and violence are present and are portrayed in a much blunter, starker light than in most novels. If there is a battle, you will see characters suffer gruesome ends, and the spoils of conquest are not glossed over. Yet, the use of such elements doesn't come off as gratuitous nor do they seem unnecessary; instead, they serve to characterize the world in which the characters go about their lives. Indeed, this is a dangerous place with far-reaching consequences and risks. It certainly puts a darker spin on the plot, but as someone who quickly bores of overly optimistic characters and stories, this darker, grittier fantasy very much appeals to me and gives the book a certain edge that sets it apart from others. Accompanying this dangerous, sometimes terrifying world is the idea that no one is safe...and that includes main characters. Martin doesn't hesitate to take characters you've grown close to throughout the book and run them through the wringer, sometimes going as far as to kill them off. One of the main point of view characters is beheaded toward the end of the book, not because he is a terrible person or because he is in some way marked as being a ""bad"" character. On the contrary, he's the most honest, reasonable character in the book, and it's his own honesty that leads to his demise. This is the point that makes you realize that ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" will pull no punches or give anyone immunity based solely on whether they are a positive or negative character, a primary character or a background character. When characters, regardless of their role in the story, enter into a conflict, whether it's physical in the form of a fight or battle or more complicated through scheming and deceit, you genuinely fear for their safety. While the traditional fantasy novel may put the main character through trials and hardships, you know he'll make it through in the end, but that's not the case here. The reader is always on edge, worrying for their favourite characters or rooting for the demise of their most hated, but you never know how it's really going to play out. It's a completely different reading experience from most books out there, putting a real sense of danger into the book's events and a feeling of suspense into the story. Another standout aspect of ""A Game of Thrones"" is the world building. Martin has not only created an intriguing world of politics, kings, deceit, battles, conquest, magic, and gritty reality, he has done it in a masterful manner. It's become something of a pet peeve of mine when authors are so proud of the world they've built that they dump pages and pages of their world's landscape, history, government, culture, etc on the reader in the middle of the story; it's a heavy-handed, clunky way of developing the backdrop of a novel. Martin manages to keep his world richly detailed while avoiding info-dumping by slipping in brief descriptions of how Westeros works in dialogue or when the subject in question appears. He doesn't appear to be in a hurry to reveal everything and instead lets things unfold in their own time. He knows his world from front to back, and he knows when it is appropriate to explain something and when it isn't. The character setup of ""A Game of Thrones"" is also pretty different. Instead of having one protagonist whose story is the focus of the book, we get 8 different characters that provide 8 unique points of view. The perspective switches in every chapter, so we often see one event thoroughly told from two or three different characters. This is a great way to keep the story from getting stale or repetitive, as all of the characters have a distinct voice or bias and no character ever receives two chapters back to back. On the downside, however, it can be a little frustrating to be enjoying the perspective of one character, only to turn the page and see that you'll be finishing the issue at hand through the eyes of a different figure. That aside, having 8 point of view characters works very well for the novel because it keeps each chapter fresh and allows the reader to thoroughly get to know multiple characters rather than just one. What is particularly great about Martin's characters is, as I said above, that they're completely distinct. They're so well fleshed out and have so many realistic motivations, feelings, and actions that it could be easy to forget that they are fictional characters rather than real people. While some characters may seem to fall into a broad archetype of character, pretty much none of the characters can be summed up on one or two words. Equally as impressive, whether you'll like or dislike a character will be dependent on how well they or part of their personality resonates with you personally, instead of whether they are ""good"" or ""bad."" Even the characters that seem to be cast in a more negative light have positive personality traits that make them likable and relatable. It also seems that what one reader appreciates about one character, another reader may dislike. The characters in ""Game of Thrones"" are so well fleshed out and realized that they sometimes seem as realistic as flesh-and-blood people, and like real people, your reactions to and liking of the characters will be based almost entirely on their complex personalities. The secondary and side characters also receive a lot of care. Although we don't get to know them as intimately as the point of view characters, we still often see enough of them to get a sense of who they are. There are a lot of side characters in the novel, with possibly hundreds of names being tossed around depending on whose point of view the chapter is told through...so you do have to pay attention to who is who. Most characters, however, appear fairly frequently and are distinct enough that it's easy to keep them straight. And those who aren't seen as often tend to come with a little reminder of who they are when they do show up. Even though there are a lot of secondary and side characters, they are given a lot of thought, making for a rich variety of figures to populate the novel's setting. To reiterate what I mentioned earlier, no one is safe. This can make for some emotional reading when the characters are so unique and well thought out. It must always be remembered that anything can happen to the characters and any chapter could be their last. Characters can meet their end very quickly or very slowly, and there's really no way of predicting if a figure will survive or not. As a side note, despite the length of ""A Game of Thrones,"" it is only the first book of a long series. This means that while this novel contains its own well-told story, it also does a lot of setting up for the overarching plot and leaves more questions than it answers at its conclusion. If you begin to read this series, you will likely become hooked on it and rush out to get the second book after you finish this one. Overall, ""A Game of Thrones"" is one of the best books I've read in recent years. It bucks the trends and cliches of modern fantasy novels and offers up something that is unique, but still contains the mystical flavour of the genre. The world presented is violent and gritty with a no-one-is-safe policy that leads for some edgy, often tense reading. The characters are wonderfully developed and fleshed out so well that they could easily be real people, and the different points of view throughout the novel offer unique perspectives on the story's events. This is perhaps the first book I've read in a long time about which I can't come up with something I don't like, aside from a couple characters...but, as I said earlier, not liking certain characters for aspects of their complex personalities is part of what makes the novel so, well, likeable. Five stars happily given for the above and for reviving my interest in fantasy.","2014-03-14","United States","","true","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NICOGIGPP74C"
"B000QCS8TW","5","The best epic fantasy yet... A mere 5 stars doesn't do it justice.","If you're like me, you expect a ""good"" book to rate highly in three areas: 1. Plot 2. Characters 3. World-building If a book gets high marks in these three areas, I find that it makes for an interesting read, even after multiple read-throughs. When I read AGoT (and the rest of the currently-published books in the series) GRRM not only ranked high in those areas, but he blew me out of the water. 1. Plot: Very unpredictable and not the typical ""quest"" theme seen in most fantasy. It is also multilayered, with plots going on from several points of view (the different plots ARE interconnected as well. This keeps it interesting even when some plot lines get slow-paced at times. 2. Characters: Very, very realistic characters with personal, family, and political issues. GRRM also takes the time to make the major characters 3-D. You discover more about each character's backstory as the book (and series) progresses. Also, characters GROW and Change, much like real people. BE WARNED- not all of the characters make it to the end, some die untimely deaths (as in real life). 3. World-building: With a cast of hundreds of characters, all belonging to various families, areas of the country, etc. you get to see a lot of the landscape, buildings, and political atmosphere that exists. You also get a lot of backstory (myths, history, etc) on the land. GRRM also does a good job of describing the various cultures that exist. Another great perk GRRM gives us is descriptions of foods and the characters' opinions of them (I love seeing a foodie, like myself, as a main character). Some things to keep in mind... - There is a good amount of sex, language, and violence in the ASoIaF series...as there is in real life. If you are not a fan of gritty reality this might not be the series for you...Although it might be worth a try, even if you end up skimming the grittier parts. - Don't get too attached to your characters. If you're the type that attaches to a single character and then feel crushed/devastated when they die, this might not be the series for you. - If you don't like long books, series, or cliff hangers...this might not be the series for you. The books are long, the plot is vast (with many cliffhangers), and the series, it is not yet finished. So be warned...It can be a very long wait when you reach the end of the last published book in the series and then have to wait for the next one to come out. - if you're into very fantastical fantasy (i.e. magical wizards, spells, and charms everywhere or lots of direct diety intervention), this might not be the series for you. I think of it as more ""historically based"" fiction, with just enough magic/myth thrown in to keep you (and the characters) guessing whether or not supernatural stuff really is going on. - Finally, if you hate dialogue and are prone to skimming between action-packed battle scenes...this is definately not the book/series for you. Believe me, there is a heap of fighting/action going on in this series. BUT there is also a lot of important dialogue, plotting, and intrigue. If you skip any of that dialogue, etc. You will be clueless later in the book/series because of how complicated the plot/s is/are. In closing... READ IT! and you won't be sorry!","2006-09-12","United States","","true","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TLIHM3FZ94CK"
"B000QCS8TW","4","Last Person in the World to Read This","It's been ages since I originally purchased this book on my Kindle. I saw the size of the book and when I got my Kindle it was one of the first purchases I made. I figured it would be better to carry it on that slim device than to lug around the rather large book. I wanted to read the book prior to the premier of the show but... well that didn't happen. So my goal shifted; I wanted to read the first book before the second season began and that also didn't happen. Well, I gave it a try at least. I began reading this book in April just after I moved to Virginia and didn't have a job. I would spend my mornings putting out job applications and then by late afternoon I'd sit back and read a little. But the size of this book overwhelmed me, not that I haven't read anything of this size before, but for some reason the slow moving percentage on my Kindle wasn't being very helpful. Then I got my temp job and this book was put down. Back and forth over the past five months I went. I would read a new book, put it down, then read 50 pages of Game of Thrones. Not only that but with trying to maintain a regularly updated book blog with ramblings about books I've read it's hard to just guarantee a number of days to read this huge book. However, I finished a book and went back to GoT for my few chapter read through and realized I was actually pretty darn close to being finished. Only, like, 200 pages left! So I read it in a flash and loved every moment of it then sat back and wondered why I hadn't just read it in one go to begin with. Nonetheless, let's talk about the book for the very few people out there who haven't read it. Because, it seems, I am the last person in the world who got around to starting this series. If you've seen the show it's a lot like the book; they did a very good job at portraying the characters and many of the scenes in my opinion. Still, this book is long so obviously it has much more detail and scenery than the show does. If you've seen the show but have not read the book I'd suggest doing so! While I wasn't keen on carrying around a copy of the book because it was so large I do wish, in a way, that I had that opportunity so that I could flip back and forth between the maps and family trees. It would have helped as the cast of the book is huge and the families are very wide spread and detailed. I have forever had issues of remembering people's names, book characters included, and had it not been for the fact that I had already watched the tv show and had faces to place with the names I probably would have been more lost as to who was who and how they were connected. The story is good, the imagery is good, the description is good. This book is good. If you have a fascination with anything remotely like Tudor history, Arthurian legend or the long, detailed writing in Lord of the Rings then A Song of Ice and Fire is perfect for you. Dragons, princesses, secrets and swords fill its pages and often times left my head spinning. This book has a touch of fantasy but it doesn't go overboard. You aren't stuck feeling like you just slipped into the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy or Hogwarts. It's slipped in so casually that you find yourself, whilst reading the book, to just accept what they are speaking of and not think twice about if dragons exist or the dead can rise and kill. Martin may put a little too much emphasis into certain details but I suspect they all come around to meaning something and he certainly helps you to picture the world he has created. It reads like some fantastic part of history yet the characters are certainly living and breathing at your ear, over your shoulder, while you go from page to page. Often times I'll read books by authors who have long since left this earth and I'm left feeling melancholy. ""Why don't people write like this anymore? Why don't they put detail into their books and write so beautifully?"" and I think I've discovered that there are authors who write in such ways and Martin is one of them. It's refreshing to be able to read a book so beautifully written and with such perfect detail that is current and published within my lifetime. Could it have been shortened down at some points? Certainly. Every other chapter I found at least a few pages that I could have gone without but what are you going to do? It's not like I didn't already know this was going to be a long book when I began it. It does have its fair share of sex scenes, incest, and rape so be forewarned of that those of you who like to avoid such plot. But it's relevant to the story, or so it seems... most of the time, so it's kind of worth talking about. Martin leaves a lot of tidbits of information through out the book which you can pick apart in your own time and wonder what it all could mean. Apparently, it's a Thing fans of the series like to do and I can understand why they would when it spans such long periods of time between publications of books. In that regard, I'm glad I waited to pick up the books so that I won't have to wait forever for each book to come out. Granted, when A Song of Ice and Fire was first published I was ten and this was way beyond my reading comprehension but at least now I can take my time, play catch up, and maybe once I'm completely caught up with the books I can join the countless others who eagerly await the next book in the series. I think what I liked best about the books was that the characters grow and change while you read. Often times you are able to witness how the surrounding events will alter a person or you are simply given privy to details otherwise unnoticed. I started the book with a dead set group of characters whom I liked and ones I disliked but by the end of the book that list had shuffled a little bit. Some of the characters I disliked at first (Sansa, for example) I had begun to like a little more by the end. While I have many other books I have to get through before I start A Clash of Kings I will be happy when I have that opportunity and look forward to it. There are many people out there who love this book and consider it a work of art, the best thing they had ever read, and swear by it. There are others who refuse to speak nothing but negative things about the book - it just did not work for them. For me, I liked it, I enjoyed it, and while I may not be standing on my office's roof proclaiming to the people waiting for their lunches that they must read this book - I still will quietly refer friends to it who are looking for a good tale.","2012-11-04","United States","","true","4","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DTKTEJSJUFQI"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Quite Simply, What You've Heard is True","I've never been a big reader of fantasy. I read the Hobbit in school, The Dark Elf Trilogy sometimes after that, and Lord of the Rings when the films came out. I am, however, an avid reader in general and was shocked when I was this great ad for a new HBO show based on a best selling series and had never heard of it. Elves, Dragons, Wizards, and Dwarves and all I decided to venture from my comfort zone and give it a shot. If this sounds like you so far read no further. Just read the book without a knowledge in the world about it. Then come back and see if you agree. If you've done that or are just looking for a general review, there is only one word for it. Epic. Not as in ""I just teabaged the leader in Halo"" epic, but as in The Odyssey epic. And it's not so much fantasy as altered history. The fantasy stuff is always somewhere lurking in the back, threatening your comfort zone but keeping a respectful distance. Then you start to become curious about it's ways as it slowly creeps in. Before you know it, you want less and less lords and ladies, and more and more demons and beasts. Now, you may have heard the series has morally grey characters, multiple plot lines, and shocking twists by now. You may thing between your Pulp Fictions and Sixth Senses and network television you may have gotten used to some of those things by now. But no, believe me you haven't. Characters aren't just grey, they're real....but in their own world. They reflect both larger ideas of behavior, mixed with unique and well sustained character traits, wrapped up in the unique attributes of their fictional world. They're real, but in their own ways. It also helps lend creedence to old re-used characters like the hardened veteran, the good knight, the noble hero, and the men turned to redemption by making them as interesting as they were when you first saw them in youth. And plot-lines aren't just multiple, they are interwoven and richly detailed featuring a host of interesting characters. The only thing better than when they all work together, is when they start to branch in their own unique directions. George R.R. Martin weaves a tapestry of the finest plot threads here, and leaves you dangling on every new verse and character. With every new chapter comes a new perspective and a new way to look a the world. It's a unique structure that is a little challenging at first, but pays off richly in the end. Plus hey, if Martin was going to create a detailed new landscape, why not explore all of it? Finally those twists. All I'll say is this. You haven't guessed them. Sure you're smart and too cool to be fooled, and you may have guessed a couple of them, but don't get cocky kid. You have no idea what's coming. Because it's not just great big twists, it's little developments along the way. The ""shocking reveal"" isn't just used for the endgame but rather keeps the story fresh and moving along through all of it's exciting escapades. My jaw literally dropped while reading this book, and I highly doubt I'm unique in that. Overall, not only is this a great book but it kicks off a fantastic series. That said though, I could see this one easily becoming most peoples favorite. Later works can get bogged down in details and side stories, therefore requiring a little slogging to get through. This first installment, however, is as tight as it is intricate. The pages fly by and you read on just to see what happens next to your favorite character (an ingenious by product of the design). Worth a read on ever conceivable mature reading level, Game of Thrones as a single book ranks among the best fantasy works ever produced and could go toe to toe with any traditional novel out there for sheer entertainment.","2011-05-09","United States","","true","5","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HF7FC32J0YO1"
"B000QCS8TW","5","If you like the HBO series...","If you like the HBO series, you will not be disappointed here. This first book corresponds to the 1st season of Game of Thrones. It is nearly exactly the same with a few interesting differences which I liked, and there is more details on the history of Westeros. The sex scenes in the book are somehow more graphic than the show but nothing that an adult can't handle (not for kids)! So I am not a big reader. I hated it when I was forced to read in school and have done a good job of avoiding serious reading save for magazines and news articles. It probably has to do with the fact that I am a slow reader. When I learned there was a book series that the TV show was based on I was interested to look into it. But when I saw just how long the books where, I just knew darn well I wouldn't read it. But the further I got into the show, the more interested I got in the maybe giving the books a try. Finally I downloaded the Kindle sample and it didn't take long to be hooked. For those that haven't seen the show but are interested in the books: The setting is a place and time like medieval Britain. The story follows a handful of great and formerly-great houses in their struggle with love and honor and power. It is a fantasy, but that is not the major part, at least not in this first book. The characters are humans and their life-struggles are those of all humans. The fantasy element is somewhat on the fringes but is there, so it may be more accessible to those weary of learning fantasy worlds like Tolkien's, like myself. The sex and violence is quite graphic and Martin's descriptions of battles is wonderfully vivid, something Tolkien skimps on in The Hobbit; I haven't finished the Lord of the Rings so I can't comment on the comparison there. If you are someone like me who got bogged down in the first book of the LOTR series, this is much easier to read and more engaging throughout. There are multiple stories line occurring all at once and Martin switches between them with every new chapter so it takes some getting used to but they are now hard to follow. The prologue was very confusing (and I've seen the show) so get through it because it sets a scene and you will understand it later. And WARNING, as I was warned prior to watching the show or reading the books, Martin has no loyalties to characters. You will love Martin one minute and curse him the next. If you want a story where the main character/hero triumphs of evil, honor over dishonor, do not read this book. But that is what makes the story so interesting: it's like the real world we live in, evil often triumphs. As for the Kindle edition: I have the both the Kindle and the paperback editions. I always have my phone on me but not always the hard copy so they serve 2 different purposes. I am someone how does like the feel of a book (I know, I know. I said I don't read... Nonetheless). As far as I can tell there are no differences. Even the art at the beginning of each chapter is the same. I switch seamlessly between the two. So in summary, I loved it. I would recommend it to everyone, even to adults who don't read much. It's a great story covered in sex and war… what's not to love!","2015-05-30","United States","","true","6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UOVDH3C6GN66"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Most Intelligent and Intriguing Fantasy Book I've Read Yet (other than LotR)","I was going to rate this book 4/5 but then I realized that if a book is worth a five it should be given a five regardless if it has flaws. I'm not out to prove which books are 'technically' but which books are the best. Therefore this book is a great book and a must read for any adult despite small flaws. Five/Five stars, Ten/Five stars, Twenty/Five stars. The Good: As in my review title I think this book is hands down one of the most intelligent fantasy books I've yet read apart from the Lord of the Rings series. The corruption, the plot twists, the betrayal, the treason, the death, the war, the love, the struggle, the brotherhood, the symbolism, the character detail, the world detail, and the gigantic scope set up for this series is all top notch. It's almost Shakespearean tragedy, in a way, done in a contemporary style. I don't know if I've known in any other modern fantasy so many real and deep characters. I feel like I can empathize most and visualize them completely (even ones without a written point of view). Martin also does an incredible job of keeping the reader on track with the separate story-lines as each comes back to itself after an absence. So on and so forth, all the wonderful comments made by every other five-star reviewer. The Bad: Unfortunately there's one thing Martin seems to have a continual habit of doing in this book (and I hope not the rest in the series) which is forgetting his point of view - just for little sentences here and there. I'm almost certain there is at least one time in each chapter where he writes a sentence explaining something (a thought, a look, some detail, etc) that the current point of view could not know. Maybe I'm just picking nits or looking too closely, not looking closely enough, but over and over this writing flaw nagged - never very much, like I said one sentence in a chapter maybe two, but it was consistent through the entire novel. Also small parts of the world I couldn't visualize completely: how do they measure years when seasons are multiple years long? or how does a world have such variable seasonal patterns? Are there miniature seasons that occur to follow a complete annual pattern underneath the greater climate change? Obviously I'm not asking Martin to provide a scientific answer to his world climate, but little things fit easily enough - change in harvests, other celestial bodies, etc that make the world make that much more sense. The former especially can be used merely in passing but provide a major world-explaining detail. The last complaint I have (which other reviewers have mentioned) is that though the bulk of the story is very adult and a major theme seems to be loss of innocence, the sex in a number of cases seems very adolescent. I believe Martin makes an effort to be mature and succeeds at least once or twice (Catelyn's sex scenes and how he writes of Lord's bastards) sometimes it falls flat and tears me out of the story (most often concerning Daenerys). However it is fully possible I hold my standards higher than most. These three details I choose to point out are ultimately negligible in face of what actually makes this book so good. They are nitpicks and can be easily overlooked/forgotten within the same page they occur. Read it, it's worth the money especially if you buy it used. I'm going to read the series in its entirety but I would be just as satisfied having read only this first novel.","2012-05-08","United States","","true","7","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29T6SC9LTQ1D0"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Five stars because these books are awesome BUT...","First of all, these books are a great read. They're well written with elegant articulation and beautiful descriptions. The plot is thought out and complex just like any good book should be, the characters have a lot of personality like any good character should have, and there's enough of a storyline to keep a very lengthy book interesting. I like that there are so many character POVs but nothing seems overdone at all. Each storyline and each character has their own separate life that the book portrays and they all have enough scattered chapters through the book that you never forget what's happening with a certain character. That being said... I have read books 1-5 and pretty much the only thing that has disappointed me - and greatly - is the injustice to the protagonistic family done by the antagonistic family. We'll call them family PRO and Family ANTI for protagonistic and antagonistic. The Anti-family has done atrocious - and I mean ATROCIOUS, not just running a dog over and urinating in your soup atrocious but I won't use specifics as to spoil anything - things to this family. These are devastating things that make me sympathize with the Pro-family, things that make me loathe the Anti-family and yearn for justice yet... it seems that the Pro-family just keeps suffering and the Anti-family continues to flourish gaining more power, wealth, and malice. The pro-family sees tragedy after tragedy for standing up to Anti-family. I keep waiting for the Pro-family to get at least a little bit of justice, just to make the books tolerable. Just a morsel, a smidgen of reprieve from this horrible life they've been condemned to but after five books they've had almost all their opportunities to get the right amount of injustice taken away from them. For them to get their much-deserved retribution they'd need to have A, B, C, D, E, F, and G killed, maimed, humiliated, overthrown, mauled, slaughtered, flayed, (enter your own ideas of the most horrific scenarios and enter some explicits and you might have an idea of what this family needs - and me too, to be satisfied) but with so many events chances of justice and ways that they deserve justice has been reduced to only options A and B. Seriously, I'm so disappointed at how the things I've been looking forward to reading in this book keep getting ripped out of the Pro-family's (and my own) hands. Other than that, though, this book moves fairly quickly, the plot furthers at a decent speed, there is just enough action and plot to keep it from being overdone or underdone. WARNING, SPOILER ALERT: I'd like to add, too, that my favorite part of the book is the Others and they've been only a minute part of this book. I watched the pilot of GoTs before I read the books and the very first five or so minutes when they showed the White Walkers hooked me and easily became my favorite part, and this has only been about two percent of the book. I'd love to read more on these things. Being that book six is supposedly the last one, and the really wicked things haven't even really made their debut I'm wondering if they'll get to do so in book six. They're like a threat that's been looming over human-kind unbeknownst to them, and no one believes they're going to be making their much-awaited appearance to the whole world. No one believes they'll be coming back. So, if I had the chance to beg anything of the fantastic author, it would be to give the family their much-deserved revenge and make the Others a huge part of book six. Please! Please!","2014-05-12","United States","","true","8","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R240BR95CHFWAF"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Compelling and Riveting!","I am writing this review as an individual who watched Game of Thrones on HBO before picking up the book series, so with that in mind you may or may not find my review helpful/useful. I will also try to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible. As a fan of the tv series, I came into this book knowing what to expect; I was told that Season 1 and Book 1 are very similar, and that is most certainly true. But do you know what? I still loved the book. I’ll do list format for the book’s good and bad points (in my opinion and in no particular order) to make this a little more organized. -- GOODS: DIALOGUE/WRITING - George RR Martin has a way with words. His descriptions of the various locations and lands and kingdoms of Westeros, from Winterfell to King’s Landing to Vaes Dothrak, have flawless flow. I love descriptive writing, and there is always a fine line between not describing something enough to give the reader a good picture and going overboard to the point where it gets boring to read through paragraphs of superfluous text. This is especially true in the fantasy genre, where the lands and people and words and customs are all…well, fantastical. This book finds that balance, with evocative, beautiful language that puts you right in that setting and right in the thick of the action. Hell, the descriptions of food always made me hungry even if they were serving something that I would never actually eat! As for the dialogue, if you are a fan of the show’s dialogue, or clever dialogue in general, you will enjoy this book. There are a good number of memorable and poignant quotes throughout the book, my favorite being “When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die,” an apt summary for sure. Bottom line, when you pick up this book, be prepared to engross yourself and be swept away to a foreign land. VOICES/POINTS OF VIEW - Notable about this book, and all the books in the series, is that it is constantly switching from various characters points of view (POVs, as I’ll refer to them from now on). And by various, I mean roughly 7-8 characters. As difficult as this is to pull off, Martin does a great job. It’s an effective way to see what is going on in multiple locations at roughly the same time while keeping us invested. I applaud his decision to present us the information this way as it gives us a greater connection with the characters and more insight into various situations as we see how they are impacting the character that we are viewing it through. Not to mention, Martin manages to keep each of the individual POVs unique enough that you don’t need to flip back to see who’s narrating. Each character has distinct personality traits and ways of thinking/speaking that distinguish them from the others. Sansa is lady-like, a romantic and naive. Arya is fiery, resourceful and a fighter. Tyrion is shrewd, astute and full of quick-witted jibes. And so on and so forth. It is also worth noting that each character, even if a few of them are in the same place at the same time, sees different things and different people and analyzes situations in different ways, so each chapter gives you new information in some way or another. It’s very cleverly done and just as frustrating when you realize “UGH this character doesn’t know what was revealed to me, the reader, in THIS CHARACTER’S chapter” which is a great way of keeping you hooked. CHARACTERS: HEROES VS VILLAINS - Getting inside the characters heads, you start to understand their motives and the ways that they think. So you get to decide for yourself what motives are justified and who you believe in or who you’re rooting for. But then again, just because one character appears to be the “hero” of the story, doesn’t mean they’ll necessarily get a happy ending. If you’re looking for a feel-good story about about good conquering evil, this probably isn’t for you. If you’re looking for a story with deep, cunning characters who you can’t always trust, who are shades of grey versus black and white, then you’ll find this book a compelling read. DEPTH - Martin has done his homework and has developed rich histories for each of the characters and their houses. Hell, the Appendix of the book has small blurbs about each house, its history, its sigil, its words/slogan and the relevant members of the house. It’s always available for you to flip back and read if you find yourself confused, which can happen. Having watched the tv series, I was less confused about the various Houses and characters coming into the book, which helped a lot. Yet I still found myself learning new information from the Appendix. It’s a great tool and shows the author’s dedication to his characters and their backgrounds. I was impressed by how richly developed everything was, even though this is only the first book in the series. NO TEENAGE DIARY DESCRIPTIONS ABOUT SEX - This book has sex in it. Quite a bit, too. I can see how this would be off-putting to some readers. Personally, I don’t mind it much. What I appreciated was that the descriptions of sex weren’t long, drawn out, excessively pornographic or mushy-gushy. I appreciated not having to wade through pages upon pages of “his fingers brushed against my fingers and my heart fluttered, he looked at me and I admired his beautiful eyelashes” or other mushy teenage romance dialogues that frankly bore the poop out of me. On the other hand, you’re not reading through pages and pages of detailed erotica either. It’s written very matter-of-factly, very bluntly and to-the-point and only went into a bit more description when it was warranted. Again, I imagine this isn’t for everyone, so you may consider this a negative. The way it was presented throughout the book, however, I felt warranted a checkmark in the “Good” category. FEMALE CHARACTERS - Some of the best depictions of female characters I have read. I was very impressed. The female characters are at all ends of the spectrum in this book, from feminine to tough to conniving. In a book where you’d assume the male characters take front and center, the female characters are just as fascinating, if not moreso in some cases. X-RAY - I have the Kindle version of this book. The X-Ray features really helps you keep track of the book’s many characters and remind you who someone is if you forget, which is SUPER helpful. I used the features many times throughout the book and it definitely aided my understanding and allowed me to further appreciate the depth of the characters and the story. -- BADS: MULTIPLE POVs SLOW DOWN THE ACTION - The constant cutting back and forth between different characters and settings, while well done, also has the side effect of slowing down some of the action. You end a chapter on a cliffhanger as the one character’s POV learns something horrifying or experiences something shocking. But then the next chapter jumps to a character who is in a completely different setting and you have to wait until you get to a chapter of a character who is in place where the cliffhanger first happened. It slows down the action a bit, which can get a little frustrating. If it really bothers you to read a cliffhanger and then wait a few chapters to see a reaction or resolution to that cliffhanger, then this book might frustrate you more than entertain you. Not to mention, if you find one character’s voice/writing style/actions particularly boring, you might find it tiresome to have to wade through those chapters to get to the “good stuff.” I know I personally had that problem in a few instances. TYPOS - I have the Kindle version of this book, and it had quite a number of typos. Not on every page or anything, but more than I would have liked. A few of them sort of interrupted the flow of the story while I was reading, but for the most part they aren’t a huge deal. Just a little annoying. LENGTH - Not gonna lie, flipping through the Table of Contents and realizing there are 72 chapters was a little daunting. And if you have a really busy schedule, you might find the length a little scary too. I’m very glad I stuck it out and plowed through, though! -- Overall, I’m a happy camper and am going to pick up the second book in the series ASAP!","2014-01-11","United States","","true","9","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QDOFMOLV9M4E"
"B000QCS8TW","5","True Literary Fantasy","[There is a thorough review for ASOIAF here on amazon which outlines many significant points, but I thought I'd put out a review in my own words, simply because I care so much about this series.] A Song of Ice and Fire, by George R. R. Martin consists of: 1. A Game of Thrones (to be aired as the HBO series Game of Thrones on April 17, 2011) 2. A Clash of Kings 3. A Storm of Swords 4. A Feast for Crows 5. A Dance with Dragons (via Martin's ""Not a Blog"" LiveJournal, he has 3 POV chapters left to finish at the time of this writing.) 6. The Winds of Winter (forthcoming) 7. A Dream of Spring (forthcoming) What's all the fuss? This series is the progenitor of a new wave of literature which combines elements of epic fantasy, dark fantasy, and intellectual literary fiction. The idea was to create a true world (in all its color, grit, mystery, politics, realism and so on) through cultured prose, and yet still have all the elements of escapist fantasy; the idea was to create real people with real drama, and insert them into a fantastic reality; the idea was to reinvent the fantasy genre from cliché hack-and-slash/sword-and-sorcery to something original, passionate, and enthralling. Martin succeeded in these goals, and inspired others to follow in a similar vein: The Malazan Book of the Fallen, The Kingkiller Chronicles, The Prince of Nothing, The Gentleman Bastard, The First Law, etc. Why so good? 1. Exceptional writing: Martin is a literary master. His prose doesn't just ""work,"" it really inspires. His vocabulary is learned yet approachable. The text inserts me directly into this medieval kingdom. Imagery runs rampant with details galore. Just a very well written story. 2. Believable characters: Grey characters! Real, believable characters with unique dialogue, motivations, and reactions populate this entire series. Martin develops interesting personalities with his talent for voice. These characters come alive within just a few pages of reading their chapters. People change! What a concept! 3. Risk: This is a world of blades and steel, arrows and leather. People die in war. This is a story of politics, intrigue, and betrayal. People are assassinated. Main characters may serve as a central window into the chief plotline, but that certainly doesn't mean that they are safe from harm. Pain and death MEAN something, and Martin loves to make us feel. 4. History: Martin has spent years living in this world, and the history is so rich that the immersion is instant. It's almost disorienting. The details that he has planned out and the meticulousness of the layers within the story are so natural that you cannot help but be in awe. 5. Tactful use of fantasy elements: No ""magic missile"" spells or ""jelly-legs"" jinxes here. There are strong fantasy elements, but they are used in tactful, and oftentimes subtle, ways. The supernatural is seen as superstition by most of the characters in the story, and so when something akin to ""magic"" does show up, it is unique and potent. 6. Details matter: Watch the description of a character, even if you don't know the character's name; they'll show up later. Actually think about what people say; you may be able to find out the answer to a question far before the characters do. Dreams and prophecies may be vague, but they are actually vital! Martin has also acknowledged his use of the unreliable narrator (in fact, he has to use it, in order to make the POV chapters believable); find the inconsistencies between what happens and what characters think, and see the story from a different perspective! 7. Engaging plot: All three main plotlines are exotic and entertaining: the fight for power over Westeros' throne, the exile of the last Targaryen queen, and the threat of the Others in the north. Filled with cliffhangers chapter after chapter, mysteries that need solving, epic moments of badassery, horrible moments of dread, cool one-liners and philosophical quotes, raunchy sex, and violent death, the story is brimming with awesome. Why doesn't everyone like this series, then? Virtually every one- or two-star review I have seen (amazon, goodreads, etc.) can be boiled down to one of three categories: 1. ""The Fantasy Lover"" (a.k.a. ""Sex is Nasty"" Syndrome) a. ""Ew, it's so gross and disgusting and tragic and there's so much sex and violence and swearing! Where is my damsel being rescued by the handsome, heroic prince? Why do people die? I felt like `washing in industrial cleanser' to get this filth away from me! Fantasy should only be about romantic ideals and have nothing to do with reality... and the good guys should always win!"" b. To you, I say, stop being such a prude. The writing is excellent and appropriate to its content, and the idea is to explore the connection between fantasy and reality. Fantasy does not have an ""end purpose"" in mind, and you are simply being obstinate about originality and progress. People are not black and white and neither is life; people die, and people are maimed, and people have sex, and people go to the bathroom, and people are raped, and sometimes, the `bad guys' win; however, I think escapist fantasy may be even MORE engaging when combined with those aspects of reality... and that is an opinion enjoyed by millions of people. 2. ""The Whiner"" (a.k.a. ""The Author is My Bitch"" Syndrome) a. ""It's been five years since the last book, and Martin is fat and old, and he has his fingers in so many pies, and he doesn't care about the series anymore, and he's just trying to milk it, and why can't he finish it already, and I could have the next book written by now, and and and and and...."" b. To you, I say, no, the author is not your slave. Your buying his books did not indenture him into servitude, nor did it oblige a contract. He writes when he writes, and you read when he's done. Complaining about it [timing, his other projects, etc.] makes you look pathetic, silly, and a tad bit unstable. It's like trying to intimidate a world-renowned TV chef to finish his/her magnum opus because you just want lunch on your TV tray, damnit! How full of yourself do you have to be? c. Also, the books do not deserve a one star rating simply because they aren't coming out as fast as you want. 3. ""The Pragmatist"" (a.k.a. ""But Reading Takes So Much Time!"" Syndrome) a. ""The first book is 800 pages, and they just get longer from there; there's no end in sight for the series and no single book tells a full story; there's too much exposition with too much `backstory'; the plot is so slow!"" b. To you, I say... well, this might actually be a valid concern for some people. The story IS huge... but in case you didn't see the genre description, it is EPIC fantasy, and Martin has himself described it as having a ""cast of thousands."" The advantages of longer books are that characters can develop into fully fleshed out beings and that a fictional world can become, in some part, real. It's also a huge story in terms of scope - the synopsis states it simply enough: ""...where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime...."" Minor Spoilers on Individual Books: A Game of Thrones A brilliant first book, this begins each of the three main plots. For the first plot, the main house we deal with here is the Starks, the house ""in charge"" of the North. For the second plot, we are introduced to the naiveté of Daenerys (Duh-NAIR-iss) and for the third, we get to see the shabby condition of the Night's Watch. Though each plot develops independently, it is easy to see how they interconnect. The characters really drive this piece, and it is a true trip for anyone, new or old, to the genre. A 5 star book if there ever was one. Obliviously, I not only recommend this specific book, but the entire series.

"B000QCS8TW","4","SUMMER IS OVER. WINTER IS COMING. BOOKS RULE.","FIRST PUBLISHED BACK in 1996, the opening volume of the fantasy epic called A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is immediately captivating, enthralling, entertaining, and even shocking. This is epic fantasy at its best. Well, for some of the book, anyway. It is also immediately obvious why and how this book (and in fact the whole series) has become one of the most watched, and most loved TV shows ever made. I won’t say that it was written just to be adapted, but the genius of the author has created a fictional world so well populated with amazing characters, who in turn love each other and hate each other with such passion that at times the book simply sizzles. At certain points in the book some characters are seen to be doing unmentionables to each other, and when discovered by innocent parties, take further measures so extreme in order to protect themselves you may well find yourself in such shock that you literally wont be able to put the book down. Long term fans of the genre will make immediate comparisons to other giants (!) of the field, and the first name to spring to mind will, of course, be J R R Tolkien, with his breathtaking LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. On a superficial level, Martin’s books are longer (by a looooong way) and yet despite the extra length and time involved in writing and reading them, he has failed to gift the reader with the quality of prose, and downright beauty, that is the trademark of Gandalf, Frodon, Elrond and company. Humour has a minor role in the book, but only with certain clans. I am thinking of the Lannisters here, folks, but only the loveable and highly durable Tyrion (the imp) demonstrates qualities of this nature worth mentioning. And of course he uses humour as a defence mechanism in order to cope with the situations and compromises he finds himself in on a daily basis. For the rest of the cast, life is much, much, much too serious to be caught laughing. And it’s only going to get worse. Winter is coming, you see. One of the plethora of strong features of GOT is character development, and they oftentimes grow and develop right before your eyes. Obviously time passes in this book but i found it immensely satisfying seeing how some of the younger generations of the book’s populace cope with, and grow into, roles they find themselves in. Some under duress, some at the hands of fate and some, Gods forbid, at the result of their own engineering. There is the subtle hint of dragons making an appearance in the story, but having just reached page 604 out of 780 I do believe that the reader is running out of time and words if they are going to be blessed with the presence of these magnificent creatures in the first book of this epic fable. Of course there is a lot more going on than just the re-emergence of dragons; like i just mentioned, Winter is Coming, and even though that is a saying strongly favoured by the Starks, it may well turn out to be a metaphor that affects the entire world that Mr Martin has so wonderfully crafted. The pace of the book ebbs and flows. It started off well, with several major emotional shocks hitting the reader full in the face early on. By page 300 I was ready to declare my personal love for Catelyn Stark (I still am) but then things slowed down and i found myself forced to carry on the exploration of this fantastic world i have become lost in. And for every page i forced myself to read, i found myself resenting the time doing so, and not spent playing hide and seek in Middle Earth with Sauron and company. But then the pace of the book picked up again, new characters came to life and a multitude of betrayals took place which made my investment more than worthwhile. Some of the locations described in the book are truly breath taking. Some of the ideas, too, are good enough to make you yearn to become one with the book and morph yourself right there. This book is incredibly deep. Characters that are presumably killed off are spoken of with such fervour and respect that you may well find yourself hoping against hope that they will be found again. There are many aspect of the book that have moved me, or grabbed my imagination by the throat and not let go. I have attempted to keep this review spoiler free and purposely vague at times. I can fully imagine myself reading GAME OF THRONES multiple times. Not for the beauty of the prose, because that is not its strong point. But certainly in order to relieve the drama, and the excitement, the cliffhangers and the shocks, you could certainly call me a fan. Four stars for a dead set modern day classic. It is not perfect by any means, and i can only assume the story will get stronger as i make progress through the books. Watch this space and I will let you know. Summer is over. Winter is coming.

"B000QCS8TW","5","There is a difference between bad reviews and BAD REVIEWERS","For many years, I held off starting this series because of the negative reviews and complaints. But after enough friends compared the series to The Wire in terms of scope and complexity, I realized that I had to give it a shot. Now I believe that this series represents one of the masterworks in the fantasy genre. There is nothing I can add to the positive reviews but I would like to address the negative reviews. If you look closely you will realize there are very few bad reviews, ONLY BAD REVIEWERS!!! The vast majority of negative reviews can be broken down into a few groups: BAD REVIEWERS GROUP ONE: Children (emotionally or mentally). I stopped reading fantasy books in my early twenties because they are, by and large, childish and simplistic. Some reviewers complain that they don't like the characters or can not identify with the characters Mr. Martin has created. I can only assume that these people want HEROES and VILLAINS. To those reviewers I say - stick with Disney films. The characters created by Mr. Martin are complex and ambiguous. In fact, many of the characters I hated in the first book, I found myself rooting for by the third book. BAD REVIEWERS GROUP TWO: Impatient amusement park riders. I will be the first to admit that it is hard to wait to find out what happens next. But people who want Mr Martin to ""finish the series"" seem to be operating under the faulty assumption that this series will end in some glorious conclusion that ties everything together. I have no such expectation. This is not Lord of the Rings. Good will not eternally triumph over evil and justice will not be granted for everyone. If that is what you are looking for, then you are craven and should return to your childish fairy-tales! BAD REVIEWERS GROUP THREE: The Choose your own adventurers. By books three and four you will notice more and more reviewers complaining about which characters Mr. Martin focuses on. Rarely, if ever, do they complain about the quality of the prose or the rich detail of this world Martin has created. Usually their reviews can be boiled down to - ""I want to know what happens to so and so right now!"" They also like to complain that some chapters are just filler that do not relate to the story. It seems to me that this complaint is premature until the series is complete. Minor characters in the first book are major characters in the third book and some characters disappear in the first book only to pop up again in the third. With this in mind I will assume that these filler characters or the information revealed in their chapters is relevant to later parts of the story. If you like a chef, you will be excited to eat whatever he dishes up. Not all of the meals will be to your taste but what you enjoy is the chef's creativity and boldness, not a specific flavor. This group of bad reviewers loved the first meal dished out and now they want everything to taste the same - To them I say - stick with Taco Bell! That way you always know what you are getting. BAD REVIEWERS GROUP FOUR: The Kindle reviews. Reviews regarding kindle formatting have no place amidst the book reviews. And some of these people complain that the kindle version should never cost more than the paperback version. I would argue that having all of the books in a slender little device is an added bonus that is worth something in-and-of-itself. Just imagine trying to travel with all five books! If you have the patience and maturity to go on this journey then I urge you to do so. Leave your expectations at the door and let the story unfold as it will. If you are going to read a story that is thousands of pages long, I would hope you are there for the journey, not the destination. For the rest of you, enjoy your Disney/taco bell/fairy-tales. Thank you, Mr. Martin for creating such a rich and surprising world. I am along for the ride, wherever it leads, and for however long it lasts!","2011-06-20","United States","","true","15","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HGMSGXMF811X"
"B000QCS8TW","5","One helluva read","674 pages of non-stop narrative & action. Most fantasy fiction falls flat from a literary perspective, and also runs the risk of being harshly compared to LOTR. G.R.R. Martin matches J.R.R. Tolkien when it comes to imagination and complexity of purpose (though Tolkien will kick ANYONE'S ass when it comes to a mastery of the English language). Martin also sets very high goals for his opus and peoples it with HUNDREDS of characters (seriously, I gave up counting after I hit two hundred). The maps leave a lot to be desired, especially when he writes about lands for which the book provides NO maps (i.e., ALL the chapters concerning Daenerys). THAT was a major error on the publisher's part. The best literary device used is titling the multiple chapters via the names of the eight major characters: Bran, Catelyn, Daenerys, Eddard, Jon, Arya, Tyrion, and Sansa. The perspective is third-person omniscient but filtered through the time and space of the character in the chapter title; very neat actually. The plot is often non-linear, which can make the read a bit confused and confusing. Chapters have a habit of overlapping a bit, but this can be attributed to the unique mode of communication used throughout the novel (raven). The book is really about House Stark and its delicate dance of death with House Lannister. And, in Book1, things do not go at all well for House Stark. Tyrion is, clearly, the authors favorite character (and, mine), since he is given ALL of the killer lines in the book. Many times, I found myself laughing out loud at the outrageous impertinence of The Imp. This character comes completely alive as he is fully-fleshed out as a most fatally-flawed yet truly decent human being. Hell, Martin could've just called the book Tyrion Lannister., not because most of the book's pages are dedicated to him, but because he steals the show. Catelyn has the most pages (106) but her character is too introverted and internally troubled to jump off the page, like Tyrion. Other characters that you can tell are headed for great stories in succeeding books (in addition to Tyrion) are the angry and under-developed Jon and the interesting and androgynous Arya. The one flaw in almost ALL the characters is something I suspect that Martin WANTED in the characters: they are all, to varying degrees, incredibly naive (stupid even) and self-destructive in their pursuit of either honor or power (or both). Also, the hedonistic sexuality and over-the-top barbarism might turn off the average reader. However, Martin tries to bring alive (and does!) an age that parallels European medievalism. In other words: don't get too attached to characters. And there are just too damned many ""Houses"" to keep track of. While I know the publisher probably balked at the expense, it sure would've been nice to have a comprehensive list of the Houses, together with all of their sigils (in color), castles, and lands. Think The Clans of Scotland or Ireland and you'll know what I mean. The ironic aspect of this book is that you will find yourself rooting for certain people (quite a few actually) to die horrible, grisly deaths (pretty much any of the Lannisters and Cleganes and members of the Small Council). Of course, you also yearn to sit down for a beer with some of the other rascals (Tyrion and Bronn immediately come to mind). If Martin can make you hate (and admire) some of his characters so viscerally, then you know he is doing something right. He is a very compelling novelist and I very much look forward to watching the series now (which I had denied myself UNTIL I read the books). Lastly, while Tolkien's characters are too archetypical to identify with, most of Martin's are too barbaric. Only a few rise to truly great heights, the highest of which is inhabited by Tyrion Lannister. Bravo, Mr. Martin! Bravo! Who'da thunk we'd be made to cheer for such a wretched, self-loathing dwarf - until we come to realize that he is the only character with a fully developed conscience and sense of true decency. Bravo.","2013-05-04","United States","","true","16","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OUYA5JU4FLKW"
"B000QCS8TW","4","Incredible Epic Fantasy","** 4.5 Stars ** As an epic fantasy, this is easily 5 stars. GRRM has an incredible way of world building and character building, and it’s insane to see a book with such rich history (like already fleshed out centuries worth of history). And reading this after having seen the entirety of the HBO show, it’s incredible just how much there is in these books, that doesn’t get touched upon in the show (which should’ve been obvious to me, book to film/tv never fully encompasses the written page). But DAMN, I loved his writing, his world building, his characters, the kingdom, and everything in between. I will most definitely be finishing this series, and anything else he has in the Song of Ice and Fire universe. The reason I give this 4.5 stars is solely the way he writes women. Maybe this vulgar way of portraying and brutalizing women was more common in the sci fi / fantasy genre back in the 90’s when this was published, but as a mid 20 yr old feminist, this left a bad taste in my mouth. Women were overly sexualized, and the fact that ALL of our young female protagonists (obvi besides Caitlyn) are under 18 is high key pedophilic, especially with the way GRRM sexualizes women 😬 I personally don’t really see the need to sexualize them in the way that he does as it doesn’t drive the plot, and it felt like he was using brutality as an excuse to be overtly sexual. All in all this left a bad taste in my mouth. Besides that, I greatly enjoyed the series starter and I’m glad I finally started it after watching the show as well as seasons 1&2 of HOTD.","2024-11-13","United States","","true","17","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP01SW2NBEN2T"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Game Of Thrones Book One","George R. R. Martin is a literary crackerjack. His episodic, massively detailed, completely fleshed-out, throughly chronicled world of Westeros complete with a multitude of characters is an undeniable page turner. Starting in the cold hard packed lands of the north filled with honor bound men and many a thing that goes bump in the night, the reader is led south to the seat of power in the Red Keep-- the iron throne. On this journey, you meet both pawns and kings and realize quickly that every act in public and promise in secret is building towards a power coup that could end the realm. Trouble descends from every direction. Intrigue is plotted in every shadow. And no one-- I mean no one-- is safe. Who will win the match and live to see another day? Because in the game of thrones you either win, or you die. This book just does it for me on so many levels. Martin's style is fully detailed but not overly flowery. I appreciate the succinct way he describes the people, the places, and the power struggles. It allows you to get engrossed in your imagination without getting swamped in the mountains of words on the pages. That is not to say that this is a brief read. This book is long, but I think even the faint of heart will look up several hours later and realize they have read 200 pages. Don't let the thickness of the book dissuade you from the fabulous story inside. Characters are the mortar that binds this book together. Martin's story is chocked full of some amazing people. Some of my personal favorites are: *Jon Snow the bastard(Martin's words not mine) son of an otherwise honorable man who leaves his family in search of adventure beyond Winterfell. *Arya Stark the rough and tough young lady of the north using a sharp tongue and shaper sword to get into all kinds of trouble and scrapes both at home and in the capital. *Tyrion Lannister the ill-begotten dwarf son of the richest of men who uses his brain in the absence of brawn. Martin is also talented at writing characters you hate. Some that I loathe are: *Prince Joffery Baratheon the cruel, painfully immature, and frighteningly merciless young king to be. *Ser Ilyn Payne the mutilated and muted knight bent on delivering the king's justice... with his axe. *Queen Cersei Baratheon the cunning, manipulative, and grasping woman beside the king who'll stop at nothing and step over anyone to stay on top. And this is really only the briefest of lists. So many characters to love and loathe and then loathe and love in turns. Get reading! The book is so good that I need to give you a disclaimer. DO NOT watch the HBO series first if you can help it. Season One of GOT did such an amazing job recreating Martin's book that it steals a bit of the glory from the novel if viewed before the book. Many of the conversations and small details are EXACTLY like the book. But some things just can't be transferred to the silver screen. The book has a few third person perspectives that really add to the feel of the tangled tale not to mention the overall story that I believe Martin is trying to tell. Knowing some things before hand can cause the book to feel like a doomed march to destruction, an illusion that Martin meticulously suspends-- until the silent sword is already swung catching the reader unawares and doubtless unprepared on several occasions. Besides, the series will rob you of the opportunity of imagining some of the characters-- personally, my favorite part of reading books like this. Overall this book is a 5 Commendable Yarn. I say 5 because I stayed up until 2am on several nights reading, the consequences of a tired day with twins to come be hanged. That and I am telling absolute strangers to read this book. I am hooked. I am trying to pace myself so that I don't finish the books too soon before the next one comes out, but I started Clash of Kings yesterday and am halfway through...","2013-02-15","United States","","true","18","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2F64P0KUQ9XXF"
"B000QCS8TW","4","The best-written and most realistic characters I've ever encountered.","Please note: I haven't watched the TV show yet, so this is a review purely based on the book. DESCRIPTION: In a world where seasons last for years or even decades at a time, at the end of the longest summer ever recorded, Winter is slowly approaching at last - and not only the season! The kingdom of Westeros is in a world of trouble, though most of them do not know it. Far to the North, beyond the Wall, strange and supernatural forces are stirring, while to the South, an exiled princess comes into her power and gathers her forces to reclaim the throne that was usurped from her family. REVIEW: Following a vast cast of characters, A Game of Thrones chronicles both the political and social games played for the acquisition and conservation of power and the personal lives of the various players in this game. The main focus is on the Stark family, Wardens of the North and descendents of the Old People, who reside in their citadel in the far North just below the Wall, Winterfell. Neddard Stark is a man of honour, integrity and loyalty, so when his boyhood friend and king asks him to come south to become his Hand after the death of the previous Hand, Ned has no choice but to agree. Leaving his sons (one of whom was grievously injured when he discovered a deadly secret while the King visited at Winterfell) and devoted wife behind, Ned and his two daughters must join the King's party at King's Landing, where feasting and tournaments drain the treasury more every day, corruption and betrayal are part of the day-to-day court mechanics and the population is becoming increasingly impoverished and desperate. Further, the court at King's Landing is seeping with poison and no one is who they seem to be. Soon mired in politics he is ill-suited to navigate with his honesty and integrity intact, Ned finds himself fighting for his own life and the lives of his daughters while his wife must fight for those of their other children. Ned's bastard son, Jon Snow is sworn into the Brotherhood who guards the Wall; an oath for life where desertion leads to death but remaining to serve may lead to even worse. The undermanned and overwhelmed contingent of soldiers is made up mostly of criminals forced to take the life-long oaths as a form of community service, and most of them no longer believe in the dangers that lurk in the Northern snows - that is until Jon's uncle, Ned's Brother, who is First Ranger, leads an expedition beyond the wall to find out the whereabouts of a previous expedition... and never returns. What I like the most about these books is the complexity of the characters. There is not one character that you can purely loathe or purely love. Everyone is doing what they think are the right thing, even though the consequences to others are devastating sometimes. Even though the cast is HUGE, each character has their own, unique personality with flaws, strengths and moments of great weakness and stupidity as well as moments of great strength and nobility. I don't want to spoil the book too much (if I hadn't already ;p), but the complexity of these characters and their interwoven stories, told from the varying limited third person POV really makes this book and this series unique and incredible. There are some flaws, though, no denying that. The chapters are sometimes more like paragraphs, and since each paragraph takes you into the POV of a different character, it takes a while to get used to the abruptness of the transitions and keep track of the million side-plots. There is also a lot of brutality, injustice, gratuitous sex and misogyny and other unpleasant subjects (including rape and infanticide) that are addressed in various ways throughout the story, which can become truly upsetting and triggering. It is certainly not everyone's cup of tea. Also, if you are a believer of easy morality, moral absolutes and a ""good guys are good and pure and wear untarnished white and bad guys are evil and irredeemable and rotten to the core"" kind of reader, this is CERTAINLY not the series for you. That being said, reading this book and living through these incredibly diverse and real characters and the complexities of things like morality, accountability, and power was one fantastic experience - an experience that left me a better and more empathetic and tolerant person.","2011-05-26","United States","","true","19","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GORKESA5AH6I"
"B000QCS8TW","4","If you already love the TV show...","This review is for: People who love the TV series GAME OF THRONES and are considering reading the books as well. In fact, let me be a little more specific. I tried reading A GAME OF THRONES several times before the show started and didn't make it more than a couple chapters before giving up. During those initial attempts, my thoughts about the book could be summed up as ""Yawn,"" and ""Ugh."" I didn't even like the HBO show at first. Season 1 struck me as okay. Good enough. Fine. I mean, you know, I watched it, so it wasn't terrible. Season 2 is what hooked me, and it hooked me good. All of a sudden I cared about everything. About the characters -- all the characters! -- and the world and the plot. I was fascinated by every little aspect of Westeros and I wanted more. So I picked up the book again, and I loved it. Obvious warning here: if you don't want to be spoiled, don't read any more of my review. So, first off: I'd heard that the HBO show follows the book pretty faithfully. For Season 1/Book 1, this is true. The HBO show covers all the main events in the book, so don't expect to be surprised, or even to hunt down side-stories or 'deleted scenes'. There really isn't much. On the other hand, I was surprised by how different characters in the book could be from the same character in the TV show, even though they're doing the same things & often speaking the same lines. I didn't pay much attention to Bran during Season 1 -- I couldn't have told you what his name was -- but he leapt off the page for me in the book; I loved his chapters. I've been mostly indifferent to Jon Snow in the show; the actor strikes me as sort of wooden and dull. But I adored Jon Snow in the book; he's funnier, more likable, and full of angst. And...the biggest surprise of all...I didn't like Ned Stark in the book. I loved Sean Bean as Ned Stark. He was so grizzled and fierce and stoic and wise. On the show, his execution struck me as a tragedy. But the Ned Stark of the book seemed provincial, complacent, a poor observer. In the book, I saw the hubris that forecasts a terrible fall. His death seemed less tragic, more inevitable. In fact, when you read with the benefit of hindsight, it's fascinating to see how often a character will make a decision whose TERRIBLE outcome you already know, and then another character will say, ""Hey, maybe you should rethink that decision, things could go wrong in a TERRIBLE way,"" and then the first character will say, ""Yep,"" and carry on. It's amazing how utterly BELIEVABLE it is that this happens, time and time again. It feels true to life, but it's only possible because the characters are fully-fleshed, and the conflicts they face are so dire. To sum up: don't read for new plot, it's all in the show. DO read to get a different perspective on the characters. DO read if you want to go deeper into the worldbuilding. For example: in the show, it's clear that some people follow the 'old gods' and some the 'seven gods' and then there's the 'one god'. If you want to know why some people follow one religion and others a different one, the book lays it out. If you want to know where Littlefinger got his nickname, if you want hints about who Jon Snow's parents are, if you totally didn't realize that 'The Dog' and 'The Mountain' are brothers who hate one another...the book DOES fill in a lot of details along these lines, and I loved the backstory. It was exactly the sort of thing I'd been craving. I'll tell you something else. I LOVE the HBO show Game of Thrones. Love it. The characters are vivid, the story is crisp and brisk -- I regularly scream or gasp or do some other embarrassing thing at the end of an episode. But the book was more impressive to me. It wasn't until I READ it that I got a handle on how many plots and characters and landscapes GRR Martin is juggling. How huge in scope, how intricately worked out this series is -- the plots, the characters, the places. It is all so present and real, and it all feels IMPORTANT. The show feels pretty epic. The book even moreso.","2013-05-13","United States","","true","20","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ED3YAPARJFEQ"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Possibly the best of Fantasy in the last 20 years","I spent quite a while staring at the blank screen in front of me to come up with a fitting description of A Game of Thrones by George RR Martin. Should I compare it to the classic Lord of the Rings for its impressively epic scope? Would it be best to focus on the honest, often painful humanity of the many characters - so rare in a fantasy novel - that personalizes each point of view? Perhaps I could impress other customers here with the sheer brilliance of a plot that weaves so many seemingly disparate stories together to form a believable alternate universe in which not only politics, intrigue, war, adventure and romance can coexist plausibly, but magic as well. How could I do such a work justice? I might as well get this part out of the way first. Obligatory Synopsis: in a fantasy continent that bears a familiarity to Middle Ages England, Winter is coming. Winter in this world means a sort of mini ice age that will last for seven years before receding. In the always-frosty Northern area, the races of nonhuman beings are gathering to advance with the snows; there are hints that there is an ancient, evil power behind their forces. At the same time in the South, political infighting for the Throne has begun. Overseas, the daughter of the dispossessed former King is maneuvering forces of her own for a bid for the throne. All this is told through the various stories of both ""good guys"" and not-so-good guys. For starters, AGOT can't be accurately compared to any other book or series in the Fantasy genre (not without insulting it). The nearest thing of its type is the laborious Wheel of Time series by Jordan - see what I mean? And yet this first in the Song of Ice and Fire series is fathoms above that aimless, droning style. Martin has perfected what Jordan had arguably introduced; the multiple characters' points of view telling the vast saga on an intimate, up-close scale. Never did I feel that I was being strung along, but rather lead by increments toward an incredible revelation somewhere up ahead. Martin builds the suspense masterfully in each book. But by far the most striking thing about the Song of Ice and Fire is the ""rules"" that the author breaks. Martin is not afraid to tell the tale from the point of view of some very unlikable, even immoral characters. He is bold about revealing facts from a character's past that challenge one's impressions and assumptions about their ethics. He does not lay all his cards on the table up front, but rather unexpectedly reveals details that later change the whole picture and twist the plot admirably. And his most unusual move: this author even allows ""favorites"" to die occasionally (no names here...)! These risks pay off well to serve the story as a whole, bring a sense of true humanity to the people of this world and drive the reader on to the next series installment. It's just too bad that I can't magically transplant my sense of admiration for AGOT onto this page. Hopefully, you are intrigued enough to give it a try; it would be a shame to miss what IMHO could be the best series of the decade. -Andrea, aka Merribelle","2003-08-25","United States","","true","21","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RS62MP35TN50C"
"B000QCS8TW","2","Don't Reinvent The Wheel, Mr. Martin","Premise: George R. R. Martin's ""Song of Fire and Ice"" series was a fresh start after I had to finished the most-current Robert Jordan book (many books ago now). Like many (many) others, I picked up the book. The length didn't scare me, especially coming off the back nine of Robert Jordan's epic, so I felt a treat was awaiting me. This treat quickly turned sour, and no sooner than the first quarter of the book. Prologue: I don't want to start by tearing the book into pieces at first because I think something should be said: many reviews have mentioned that the ""writing was excellent"", yet they state examples of how they hate the writing; and I don't want to fall into that trap. The ""writing"" isn't what is good here. What Mr. Martin has done for us is take a simple twist on telling his epic. Instead of blundering through plot-by-plot steps, even disconnected plots at times, he does so through the eyes of ""Point-of-View"" characters. On top of this, his finesse in creating believable dialogue is wondrous. These are merits, and worthy of recognition. Bravo, Mr. Martin. I do applaud your brilliance in that arena. However, it is in the other aspects of ""writing"" that you have failed, and sadly, in a *very* important aspect. The Torn Pieces: A Game Of Thrones started out with amazing potential. The ""Others"" were a great concept that Martin invented to enthrall our imaginations, like fantasy novels do, but what he fails to make them a ""clan"" of importance. Once we get a taste of them, we never see from them again. In addition, we are introduced to a sudden political sub-plot, as it were to be. Ah, but there lies the problem... We aren't in a sub-plot, we have been introduced the *real* plot instead. I won't throw the book down yet because I have not read enough to really know exactly what is going on, especially as the characters are only slowly developing, but I can see quickly that the ""fear"" of the Others is less of a concern to anyone who was in the novel. After trying to endlessly battle whether the Others were a ""hidden"" threat in hope of a grandiose and epic ending to the first novel, I instead keep going deeper and deeper into a story about bastard children that has little to do with anything at all. After nearly 300 pages of reading, we learn that no one is pure. Everyone, even the purest, are doused in unholy thoughts and illegal behavior. Morals and ethics have no place in this novel, and it immediately made me think otherwise about finishing it. But again, I felt I should continue believing things where only building (as most good books do build many different plots and oddities together into a perplexing climax). I was still stumped, another few hundred pages down the rabbit hole... One day I picked up the book to see that I was more than half way done, but I could not remember any memorable parts that could be identifiable as ""sections"" or closed plot section. All the links from the plot are muddled into an ambiguous political drama where each character plays out the hero, villain, and idiot. A soap opera, if you didn't know what that was. To make matters worse, the characters I pegged as heroes from the start of the book were all killed off. Now, I have no problems killing characters (and a good author does so in a way to build others characters, or strike a good turning point in the story), but Martin literally just decides to go ""Um, you die now"" out of thin air. He waves his magical hand over the paper, and suddenly 10 chapters of the book have become pointless jibberish of character development that really never mattered at all. This is probably one of the largest portions of his ""writing"" that he failed to learn about: You don't invest so much time and real estate (portion size based on novel size) building a character that is to be killed quickly. A good debater would argue that Martin wanted to make even his smaller characters have depth, but I would still argue that less focus and smaller amount of space would have simply done the job. I continue on the rant about characters because it is vitally important. Here though, I want to address to the characters themselves. And again, I want to make a premising statement: Martin has done no ""copy cat"" of his characters. If the man were to sit down and create blank characters from scratch to write a politics-driven story from, I would imagine that *every* character would have been seem at least once before from *any* preceding work even remotely based on the subject matter. It's not impossible to create new and interesting characters, but to imagine that every author is going to have that amazing imagination, then I fear we will all be waiting for the second coming of Jesus. With that said, Martin does fail again at even attempting to make the reader guess as something called ""motive"". Every person in real life has a motive, and in general, they are never the same as someone else. Even those who seem almost identical may in fact be trying to accomplish the same task for two completely different reasons. Martin does not begin to let us think that's the case. Each of his characters was early-on identified as a Hero or a Villain. And in no particular way did he try to disguise the situation. It's not unheard of to know the heroes and villains beforehand in a politically-driven plot, as the mystery to learn the truth is a driving point, but again, Martin fails to do so by giving it away in the first quarter of the book. He hands you the villains, then shows you the mystery, and flashes it all away into a mindless jumble of awkwardness for another couple hundred pages of idiocracy. I've spoken of the mis-plot that Martin plots, then I spoke of the wasted space used to develop dead characters, and then I spoke of removing the mystery from the plot. What else can I say about this book? Lots. First, let's not forget that another sub-plot (or is it the main plot in disguise?) is revolving around a group of people who fear ships living an ocean away who want to eventually be led by an unwise and stupid leader striking out solely with revenge. Although pundits will chime in to say ""Martin has three distinct plots to eventually diverge together, so it's not a subplot, it's part of the main plot""... guess what, it's not. *Spoiler alert* Four books later, and it's not happened yet.*End Alert* I hate to go on with this one because it almost speaks for itself. Same as half the characters he created for the story. I've given Martin the benefit-of-the-doubt that he wanted to create unique characters, but he didn't try to make unique enough. It was no stretch of the imagination that every character did what I was expecting them to do, simply because it was obvious in their actions/dialogue. With all of the amazingly wasted character depth created for dead characters, Martin could have filled his novel with more dynamic situations and characters who he planned to evolve over the course of the series. Second, where's the magic and fantasy that this novel's culture takes claim too? We are merely teased with ""dragons"" and brief mentions of ""magic"", but Martin does not deliver. Not once (until later novels) do Dragons even enter the world. In addition, the minor ""magical tricks"" that are employed are mind-numbingly stupid. The time it takes to wait on any real fantasy to happen, I'd be an old man dead and long gone. In conclusion, since you have potentially forgotten many things here: Martin has the potential to be a grand writer. His dialogue and creative intent at skipping the traditional way to tell a story lend to an amazing basis of a writer, but he has to learn how to develop characters in a way that the reader is not being told what he/she is/are doing, but learns it from their interactions with the other characters; and in the same vein, to not develop characters that will be suddenly killed. Also, a dose of uniqueness to brighten up the carbon-copy characters that Martin may-or-may-not-have stolen, but created for his world, would help readers identify them to his story rather than constantly asking the question ""Where do I remember this person from?""","2011-02-15","United States","","true","22","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FK1C6C16692M"
"B000QCS8TW","4","Spectacular series, Kindle version needs to be proof-read.","I have enjoyed Mr. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series for quite a long time. I have read and re-read all of the books many times, and they never get old. Now I have all of the books in paperback, but I decided to get the Kindle version for my iPhone library. As much as I love the books I couldn't help but be annoyed. It seems that the Kindle version wasn't proof-read or spell-checked at all. There are so many spelling mistakes in it that my eyes glazed over at points. not just a few mistakes, but as many as two or three every few pages. For example, I am about 3/4 or so through the book and I have only seen the country of Dorne spelled correctly once. Every other time it is for some reason spelled Dome. There are numerous times when in one sentence a character's name is spelled correctly, and two sentences later the name is misspelled. There's also randomly inserted punctuations like brackets where there shouldn't be, and some punctuation is missing or wrong (A missing ' in a contraction or a ! in place of a ?). Also for some reason there are some words that are italic that should not be... I downloaded both Game of Thrones and it's sequel, A Clash of Kings. I really hope Clash isn't as bad. I still enjoyed the Game of Thrones Kindle version due to it's convenience and what-not but the constant mistakes do get fairly annoying. Thats just my take on the Kindle eBook aspect of this. The book itself is spectacular. If you are looking for a Tolkien-esque fantasy then you are looking in the wrong place. The pure evil in this world is pretty much just a whisper from the north. An after-thought to the main points of the story. This is a gritty, no holds barred tale of medieval life. Rape and violence, death and betrayal. Younger readers and people looking for the standard feel good, pure good versus pure evil fantasy trash will not like this series. This is a much more realistic world set in a medieval-like time period, not a pretty story with perfect-featured elves and a bad guy intent on destroying the world even though he is living in said world. There is no little piece of gold jewelry that needs to be destroyed to save the world. If a character you care about in the series dies he will not be coming back. A main character will not take one lesson at swordplay and suddenly be a master swordsman. Nor will he gain an undefeatable magic power. One thing to note as well is Mr. Martin's writing style in these books. he doesnt just focus on one or three character's point of view. Each chapter in these books is told from the point of view of a different character. One chapter will be from the point of view of John Snow, then next will by Tyrion Lannister, then Arya Stark, then back again to John Snow. Some people may not like it, annoyed that the eyes they are looking (reading) from changes so constantly. Personally I like it. You get to know all of these character's more and more. You see from their eyes instead of them being just a name viewed by the main character. A warning, there are 4 books in the series, the 5th coming out relatively soon (we all hope) but George has said that he will NOT release a book unless he is satisfied with it. Deadlines do not matter in the face of quality, and if the book is not up to snuff he will not release it until it is. Supposedly there will be 7 books total. There have been some long waits in between the books already out so do not expect the next volumes to be coming out annually, or even bi-annually. They will come out when they come out.","2010-06-27","United States","","true","23","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R214LFPC7LCIVW"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Unforgettable Beginnings","With the hit TV show airing for the past three years on HBO, the book series A Song of Ice and Fire has absolutely gone viral. Those who haven't read it or ever heard of it now wish to read it and those that want nothing to do with the books eagerly await the TV series or ask those who have read the books what happens next. A Game of Thrones, although the title for the TV show, is only the first book in a seven part series of which only five books are currently released. When George R.R. Martin first published A Game of Thrones very few people outside of the die hard fantasy fiends thought of picking it up. Topping close to 1,000 pages, with extensive geologies, hundreds of characters, and a plot thick with political intrigue it is a difficult book to sit down and get through. The character set ups alone can be daunting since GrrM has this particular interest in making every character a round character. However, once you are past that hurdle, the book is an absolute diamond among recent fantasy novels. The story, the characters, the landscape, the hints at magic, the political channeling throughout, the dialog, the creatures, the cities, all of it is enrapturing and once you take a hold of this book it will be difficult to put down. GrrM captures the essence of humanity and shows us the process of being as dynamic as reality. The characters are loved and hated all at once, the story makes us question our own judgment, and the events tear at our hearts or harden them. A TV show cannot properly convey such depth since something like that takes quite a deal of time and energy, but Martin is sure to make us feel this way within the story itself. It almost needs no introduction after the sensational HBO series, but it does require some guidance for those who have not heard of it despite the cultural giant it has become. The Stark family take the front stage in this book and win our hearts with their old world pride, honor, and dignity. They are from a cold, harsh land, the first major castle and town south of the infamous Wall which is the land's metaphorical boogeyman behind the closet doors. Eddard and Catelyn Stark along with their children, including but not limited to a bastard son, are swept into the political way of life when their King, Robert Baratheon, requests Eddard to sit on the High Council as Hand of the King. Essentially, Eddard, or Ned, will help rule (more like just plain run) the kingdom's affairs in far off, southerly, King's Landing. What follows is an ever-flowering rose that is hardly fragrant and hardly polite. The world shifts and the Game of Thornes begins. Absolutely worth the read, beyond any shadow of a doubt. My only recommendation is that if you are NOT the strongest reader or you are leery of beginning the book what with the flood of characters to digest then watch the first couple episodes in the TV series. That will help to insure that you will know exactly who is important and who isn't in the grander scheme of things. Though I usually do not make such a recommendation, it will help if you feel that you need it. Otherwise, plow through and I promise that those that are important will definitely shine as you pursue this absolutely groundbreaking, unforgettable beginning to an ever-evolving tale.","2013-07-08","United States","","true","24","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK6FG3ZVIEE2D"

"B000QCS8TW","5","Fantasy for those who have never cared for fantasies","I place the blame on hobbits and boy wizards, but I have never been a fan of any book that classifies itself as ""fantasy."" Oh sure, I can and do enjoy urban fantasies featuring vampires, werewolves and the like ... but toss in hobbits with the details of all their many meals during the day and boy wizards who you know in advance will be standing by the time the book or series comes to an end, and I run the opposite way with all possible haste. That was before I was introduced to George R.R. Martin and the world of Westeros. Frankly, I had never heard of Martin nor his books before a friend encouraged me to watch the HBO production of A Game of Thrones. I'm still trying to figure out why the series clicked with me, but it did. So, too, did the first book in the series. I managed to read through the book in a week, something that I can rarely do with an 800-plus page book. By the time I finished, my preconceptions about fantasy novels had been shattered. I've even jumped straight into the second book of the series, so anixous to continue the plot threads of so many richly drawn characters laid out in the opening book of the series. To be sure, there are some fantasy elements to the book such as references to dragons, white walkers (who seem to be a bit like vampires) and the Little People of the Forest (perhaps the faerie folk?). But the emphasis is on the human characters. These aren't the type of characters you can group into Good and Evil camps. The best and most noble of characters can do bad things and the worst characters can surprise you by doing the right things sometimes. These are fully realized human characters in all their glorious shades of gray. It often seems that the ""magic"" overshadows the human elements in fantasies, but in A Game of Thrones it seems this ""rule"" has been turned on its head. There are no hair-breadth escapes with the aid of a magic wand or an incantation. Swords don't glow with magical intent. The people of the north may still go to sacred groves to talk to their gods, but if the gods choose to answer it is not with any sort of human voice. In other words, the tale holds together on a rational level without resorting to supernatural intervention. Even though some plot points may require a leap of faith, I found myself willing to make that leap with Martin and his characters. Oh sure, there are elements I still scratch my head over, like how winter can be brief or last for a decade or how the humans can trace their history back thousands of years but seem to progress so slowly when it comes to technology and innovation. Perhaps these questions will be answered later in the series, but for now I'm intent to experience Westeros as Martin intended it. Perhaps there will come a time as I read further into the series when I come to a point and say ""Oh, that's preposterous!"" and put the series down never to return. But for now I've gone farther than I ever imagined I would with the series and hope to go even further. What I do know is that if all ""fantasies"" were this detailed and grounded in a more real world, I would have been a fan long ago.","2012-03-28","United States","","true","26","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NMC0L4EF2P2S"
"B000QCS8TW","5","A Game of Waiting","There isnt much more to say that hasnt already been said about this fantastic series. The only point I'll make is when I decided to read this series the first three books were on the market with the remaining books still unwritten or not published yet. I typically don't like to start reading multi-book sagas that are unfinished because I hate the thought of investing time in something that has no end yet because a) the author may get distracted by other projects and never finish the series b) the series will finish on a disappointing note leaving the faithful readers with an unsatisfied conclusion or c) the series will be completed but it will take eons for it to be written and published. Some readers may actually enjoy the uncertainty and the wait and I respect that. For example, Harry Potter fans have stuck with the series book by book but it seems to me that those books were written and published on a regular interval and has recently concluded with much fanfare. This series is a bit different in that no one has any idea when the next installment will be released and the end is not in sight. Having said that I still decided to pick up the first three books based on the rave reviews and read each one with great dedication. My thinking was that as I read the first three books, the fourth will be published and the fifth would follow shortly thereafter. Now I'm regretting my decision because its been a few years since I finished Book 3. Book 4 is out now and has gotten mixed reviews (see b above). The series has expanded to a 6th book and there is no target date in the near or distant future for them(see a and c above). So before you decide to spend your time reading these books think about whether your ok with the three scenarios mentioned earlier. If you are then go for it and enjoy as it is certainly one of the finer fantasy reads out there (for the first three books). If not, then I would think twice before diving in. UPDATE (Sept 2008) - Nothing has changed. Still waiting for Book 5 and no one (including the author according to his webite) has any inkling when it will ever be finished. Of course, when or if the book is ever completed thats not even the end of the series. There's still another book that has to be written! I'll check back in a few years...maybe by then Book 5 will have been released and then everyone will be playing the waiting game for Book 6. UPDATE (Nov 2009) - Out of morbid curiousity I decided to check in to see if Book 5 had been released yet or if there was an anticipated release date. I am not surprised that the answer is NO and there is no hope in sight. The good news is that the Fire and Ice books which I read a long time ago are a distant memory meaning that I really don't remember much about the storylines, plots or characters anymore and consequently I'm happy to say I have no attachment to this series anymore. Even if Book 5 came out next week and got rave reviews (highly unlikely) I would not read it because I would be setting myself up for another long, drawn out wait for the next installment. No thanks, I'll pass.","2007-08-25","United States","","true","27","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38PLMGV9EVSB2"
"B000QCS8TW","4","Allow your mind to escape from the stereotype of ""Fantasy""","I never considered myself an admirer of the whole Fantasy genre. There was always a fine line I would never cross over. However, I think I have stumbled onto something very special with A Game of Thrones and the whole A Song of Ice and Fire series. I was pleasantly surprised with this work. Never have I read a book where the chapters are separated into individual characters points of view, centered around that one character and their whole environment-it was very refreshing and brilliant of the author. I have found a little patience is asked of the potential reader when first entering the world of the Seven Kingdoms. The separate chapters and introductions of key characters may seem never ending, but with some interest and an open ""trusting"" mind follow Mr. Martin into his ever growing epic. However, if you find yourself completely lost with keeping which characters are ""direwolf"", ""lion"", or ""stag""--flip to the back of the books and discover complete lists of houses, families, alliances, brief descriptions (believe me it will serve the new reader well to reintroduce themselves after finishing one book and moving onto the next). In A Game of Thrones, I overall adored the plot and was fascinated with the research that paid homage to medieval elements: the weapons, clothing, feudal system, battle scenes, war tactics, geography etc. It all just flowed beautifully where you believed you entered into a realistic world with minute touches of whimsy. On the note of ""whimsy"", I am happy, relieved and thankful to report to any interested readers that there were no to a few cliché fantasy characters/species. A Game of Thrones (as well as the whole series) is full of betrayal, adventure, drama, mystery, and classic revenge. I found myself gasping when thrilling and dismal surprises touched heroes and villains alike. Throughout the novel(s) the evidence of ""grey"" characters was an unexpected change from the usual light and dark personalities. The reader will also find that Mr. Martin has a talent to capture and bottle the element of foreshadowing (every ""symbol"" has a meaning that will resurface with a flash and a boom as the reader progresses into the ever growing plot). I must also note that, it has also come to my attention that Mr. Martin has based his brilliant series on actual history or to more specific the Wars of the Roses and possibly even pulls events and pieces from the hardly mentioned Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War- this creates interest, curiosity for many more topics and events to be explored by any potential reader (you will love History again). The only part(s) in this book (and series) that keeps it becoming a solid 5 star rating (for me) are the graphic sex sections and modern vulgar language. At first, I tried to remember history/ancient beliefs, human conditioning from the Medieval stand point and the warped entertainment expectations of today (sadly, sex sells). All of the needless scenes and language all seemed to sum back to something that unfortunately had to be there to push the realism and sell the product. Realism and product marketing aside, I must confess after awhile the graphic scenes and cussing (that seemed to come out of nowhere) started to wear on me and I desperately wished them gone from my vivid imagination. All negative aspects aside, I am very happy I stumbled upon this series and highly recommend for those readers who wish to escape from the stereotype of ""fantasy"". reviewed January 2011, review written 2011","2012-09-30","United States","","true","28","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGWROFFKHFLX6"

"B000QCS8TW","5","Epic.","That was epic. I first heard about Game of Thrones from the TV series. I watched Season One, and a little bit of Season Two. To be honest, I really REALLY wanted to like it. But hard as I tried, I couldn't get into it; everything was just so confusing, and there were way too many characters and plot lines to follow. I gave up after the third or fourth episode of Season Two. Then, people started talking about how much better the book is. I still really REALLY wanted to like it, so I decided to give it a read. Those people were right. As is typically the case, the book is about a thousand times better than the TV series. There are still lots of characters, and many different plot lines. In fact, there are more sub-plots than there are on TV, but the book goes into so much more detail, that everything just started falling into place. That, and the fact that I'm reading the book at my own pace, and can always page back if I forget who a certain character is, or where he fits into the story. The characters are all instantly memorable, but fair warning: what you've heard about Mr Martin's propensity to kill your favourites off without warning is absolutely true. It makes the world feel more REAL, though, and it's very period-appropriate. One moment you believe that a character's going to be the saviour of the world, and live on throughout the series, and the next there's a jousting accident and he's dead. Gone. Never to be mentioned again. My favourite character, like I think most people's favourite is (whether you're reading the book or watching it on TV), is Tyrion Lannister, the Imp. He was cast perfectly in the TV show, but he's portrayed in even more detail in the book. If you'll indulge me, I'll share a quick quote: ""How would you like to die, Tyrion Lannister?"" ""Peacefully in bed, with a young whore's mouth around my cock, at the age of eighty."" Something like that. I may have paraphrased. Other things I noticed, that made the world seem more real, and more appropriate to the period, were the ages of the characters. I think they're mentioned on TV, but it's little more than a gloss-over, if I remember correctly. Jon Snow, for example, is fourteen years old when he goes to spend the rest of his life on The Wall. Dany is thirteen on her wedding night, and her husband is something like twenty-five. I understand that stuff like that would be difficult to portray on screen, because of modern sensitivities to things like the age of consent and statutory rape. If you've watched Season One of the TV series, you're sure to enjoy the book, because it contains things that I don't remember seeing on TV. If you haven't, you're even surer to enjoy the book. Oh, one more thing: the book actually ends a little way (probably the third or fourth episode) into Season Two of the TV series. Which happens to be about when I gave up watching, so from here on in, EVERYTHING'S going to be new for me!","2016-01-19","United States","","true","30","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDMGQU72UP3ZQ"
"B000QCS8TW","3","Not your average Fantasy book (and that might be good or bad, depending on your taste)","There is something everyone who is thinking about reading this series should know, IT ISN'T YOUR TYPICAL FANTASY NOVEL. Is that a good thing, you ask? Well, maybe. **************************************** You might like this book if . . . **************************************** 1. You would rather read about political manipulations than fighting and war-mongering. 2. Very graphic sex scenes do not bother you. 3. You do not require lots of magic in your stories. 4. You enjoy well developed, detailed characters who tend to have fatal character flaws. 5. You like a very long, very in-depth mystery 6. You don't mind reading about the ""grit"" of medival life. Nothing is sugar coated here, rest assured of that. 7. You don't mind not having a central character to root for. **************************************** You will hate this book if . . . **************************************** 1. You expect a fantasy novel to have lots of fantasy in it. 2. If 15 pages of action out of 200 is not ok with you. 3. Very detailed sexual exploits offend you. 4. You want to really care about a character or need someone to root for. 5. You don't like really long stories (if an 800 page book makes you shudder, this one isn't for you because it only gets worse) 6. Similar sounding names infuriate you. 7. You don't mind keeping up with 8+ plot lines and 20+ major characters. *****Magic***** There isn't a whole lot of magic in this world. Especially when compared to something like Harry Potter in which everything up to, and including, the crapper is magical. Here is a list of just about everything magical I could find: 1. Ancient tree spirits 2. Ancient undead . . . things 3. Extra long seasons. A typical round of seasons might look like this: summer lasts 7 years, fall last 3 years, winter last 5 years, spring last 4 years, summer last 4 years, fall last 6 years, etc. 4. Children grow up faster. From the way the story is written (he never explicitly says one way or another) we can conclude that children reach maturity much sooner than ""real"" people do. So, a 15 year old boy is equal to a 18 or 19 year old ""real"" boy. Likewise a 13 year old girl is equal to a 16 or 17 year old ""real"" girl. It is a little odd but you get use to it. *****Characters***** Many of the characters are either stock, evil or borrowed from some other pieces of fiction. There are several who are ""good"", many who are ""bad"" and a handful whom are ""indifferent"". Yet, in spite of all of that it is easy believe that they are real. Martin does a good job of making them seem lifelife. So, even if you think you have seen them before they are still crafted nicely here. There aren't that many truly unique characters though and no one exists as ""The Hero"". *****Action***** Very limited action considering the amount of story telling that goes on. There is a tournament, a war, lots of brawling and the occasional fist fight. If you need lots of adventure go buy a comic book because this isn't for you. *****Plot***** This is a very plot driven story. The plot is interesting, don't get me wrong, but it can get a little tiring at points. Most of the time you will try and unravel the many mysterys laid before you and thus won't notice (too much) that the book is really long. Now, I am not against long books, provided there is a point to all that length. Writing just to fill space annoys me though. And while Martin is interesting, and descriptive, there are times when I think an editor should have gone though this thing a little harder than he originally did. So, overall, do I recomend this book? Sort of. If you can get past the lack of action and magic then this isn't too bad of a book. Here is an interesting note, though. If Martin had taken out the 4 somewhat magical elements of this book, changed the setting to medieval Europe and modified a few names, then this could easily sit on the ""Fictional History"" shelf.","2005-12-12","United States","","true","31","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRIA9450DXI6W"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Extremely skeptical at first, but grew to love it immensely","When I began reading A Game of Thrones I was thoroughly excited. I had read a great deal of the reviews here and knew mostly what I was getting into. I was prepared for the multiple points of view setup of the books, and I was prepared for the adult content, both sexual and violent (in fact, the fact that these books were written for an adult audience is one of the main reasons I started reading them). However, about 50 or so pages into AGOT, I was feeling let down. I had just finished reading a majority of the Sword of Truth series and Feist's Riftwar Saga and was expecting a fairly fantastical fantasy book. Well, that isn't really what AGOT is. It focuses more upon the character development, familial relations, and political positioning, and almost ignores any sort of fantastical elements; with Wizards, fantastical creatures, and Magic being merely mentioned in the background. This bothered me for a while because I had it in my head that what I wanted to read about would be at least 50% fantasy and magic. I stayed the course, however, because of the great reviews and am now thoroughly in love with these books. I actually like it better how GRRM makes magic and fantastical creatures a rare and unusual thing in his world. Because you rarely read anything to do with magic, when it does come into play, it is more mysterious and entertaining than it would be if it were the main focus of the book. For anyone that has read the Sword of Truth series, magic is the absolute focus of the book. In fact, everything else takes a back seat. However, this makes magic fairly mundane, which I don't think it should be. Furthermore, Martin's writing is absolutely superb. Not only is every character distinct emotionally, but they are also distant in a familial way. They all have their own ancestors with their own particular and unique histories. These histories and family traits play a large part in the characters actions and feelings with which you spend so much time. I've never read a fantasy novel with so much political intrigue, deception, and manipulation, and now I wouldn't want it any other way. The only flaw I see in the series, not including how long it is taking for the ""fifth"" book to be released, is that Martin's world seems almost too untrustworthy. Anyone can be killed at any time, however it is usually the good guys that seem to have the worst things happen to them. Rarely does anything bad happen to the ""villains"" in the story. With the ""fifth"" book being still a ways off, I don't see any way to wrap this series up without having the bad guys on top in some way. Now I'm not against realism (having the bad guys win), but I also realize that the bad guys don't always win in reality (probably because there are no ""bad"" guys, only different situations). This is not really a flaw, just a depressing fact about the books and my lack of imagination with which to see a way out of the pit of despair Martin has dug for his more noble characters.","2008-04-25","United States","","true","32","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FZ56DABZONJ6"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Do Believe the Hype!","This is a great book, but I'm sure that you're here reading reviews because everyone has told you about how amazing Game of Thrones is. So, let me tell you what the big deal is with this book. There's so much going on in the pages of the first book of this series, that it's difficult to know where the review should start. I won't spoil any of the story because part of this series' magic is Martin's astounding ability to surprise his readers on nearly every page, but allow me to give you a bit of a breakdown of the basic pre-plot. (I hear lots of people ask what GoT is about, only for a fanboy to give them a long-winded, spoiler-riddled answer that turns off the person asking) In Martin's world there are two major known continents, Westeros and Essos. Westeros is a continent that is ruled by the King on the Iron Throne. In the history of Westeros, there have been a great number of wars fought for The Iron Throne. A Game of Thrones begins with focus on the Starks of Winterfell. Ned Stark is the lord of Winterfell, and also an old friend of the king, Robert Baratheon. When Robert's Hand of the King (like an adviser who, more or less, does all the decision making for the king) dies, Robert visits Winterfell with his entire court to beseech Ned to become his new Hand of the King. This is a big deal for Ned, but when his wife Catelyn hears rumors that the previous Hand of the King was murdered by someone in Robert's court, The Starks begin to grow suspicious of the treachery hidden in the machinations of the Iron Throne and the Kingdom. When they begin to dig deeper, they open up an entire world of corruption, intrigue, betrayal, and double agents. What follows is an exploration of a fantastical fantasy world, plagued by the same very human folly that is destroying our own world. I don't want to say much more than that because (again) a lot of this book's charm is in its ability to surprise and shock the reader with great storytelling. Now, I understand. This book and series is certainly not for everyone. It's a long book with a plethora of complex and nuanced characters in a world of Fantasy. However, the storylines and themes are so all-encompassing and kaleidoscopic, that there is also something here for everyone. If you like murder mysteries, chivalric romance, magical happenings, political thrillers, high-octane action, brutally engaging war scenes, medieval fantasy, really ANYTHING, there's something here for you. In short, if you haven't read the book or seen the show, I can't recommend it highly enough. Before I checked it out, I was so sure that there was no way it could live up to everyone's hype. But once I saw it for myself, I was hooked by the first chapter. The hype is accurate, and I honestly believe this book and series may be one of the greatest things to happen to the human race.

"B000QCS8TW","4","It took nearly 6 years, but I finally finished it!","Game of Thrones centers on the power pulpit of the Iron Throne and the households/kingdoms that King Robert Baratheon and his wife, Queen Cersei Lannister command. Things are well and good between the various households, but it doesn't stay that way for long. In a land where summers last decades and winters last lifetimes, trouble is brewing and the Stark family is right in the middle of it. In addition to treachery, deceit, and bloodshed between warring households, there is another element to worry very deeply about - what lies beyond The Wall protecting the Northern and Southern lands. As winter returns so do the things that go bump in the night and supernatural/dark forces that were only a part of scary children's stories, begin to become all too real to the inhabitants of the Northern and Southern households. Dark times are coming for everyone and the reader is sucked in by just who will be left when it's all said and done? Several years ago, I gave up on two books (Dune and Game of Thrones) and missed out on great series due to thinking they were just too complex and wordy. Now after reading this book (in addition to re-reading and completing Dune), I can say that I definitely appreciate it that much more a 2nd time around. While reading a Game of Thrones, the biggest thing is to not get frustrated/bogged down with all the characters, descriptions and side-stories. You do need to know who's who and where palces are, but don't let that ruin the enjoyment of the book for you. What helped me out a lot was finally watching the immensely popular HBO series with the same name and then I started to pick the book back up and was amazed how much the TV series helped my imagination/understanding out. It might not work for everyone. At the end of the day, you might still decide Game of Thrones just isn't your cup of tea... but at least give the TV series a shot and then go back and tackle this book! Just some advice from one formerly confused reader to another! :) Overall Martin does a really good job developing characters you either love or hate as well as developing the overall plot and plots within plots element of Game of Thrones. ***very small spoiler***Perhaps the most interesting bit of all is that this was really the first book that isn't shy about killing off it's main characters. I guess I've been sheltered throughout my reading career in that the author has never had the guts to do such a thing consistently, but Martin does it in abundance and pulls no punches in this book. At first it was shocking, but then I realized it really made the book that much better. Admittedly, Game of Thrones is a little wordy at times and probably 300 or so pages bigger than your average novel in a series, but it's well-worth the read if you have patience and get through the 1st book. The ending is well-done in that it's not quite a cliffhanger, but it makes you think ""wow, I really want to know how all these ends are going to tie together in the next book!""","2012-01-19","United States","","true","34","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IEQ1OGHCDP6T"

I have read a few fantasy books in the past couple years and they always seemed to be inspired by DnD on some level. I heard about this series and how adult and unpredictable it was. And the HBO adaption got me that much more excited about it. Well one thing that makes me want to give this a high rating is that it is decidedly NOT of the LotRs/DnD school of fantasy. It's much more of a political intrigue and situation manipulation sort of a thing. This isn't for your 7th - 12th grade audience in other words, it's more for college and older. Not everything is spelled out for you, some things are insinuated and you have to decide for yourself who is working towards what agenda. I won't try to summarize the plot but I will say I think I enjoy Jon Snow and Tyrion possibly the best. And indeed main characters do die, sometimes this is predictable sometimes not. I haven't really figured out why the story is told from the perspective of some characters and not from others. The only complaints I have about are the incredible number of different characters introduced. There's all these houses with different insignias who have married other houses and produced uncles and nephews and some relatives are more in line with that house than with this other one and...it's just hard to keep track of. Maybe that's more on me than the story to make sure all that stuff is tracked. In fact I may have to read this book a second time. The other complaint is the ending or perhaps the lack of an ending. None of the story lines really concludes, you just kind of finish a chapter and find yourself at the appendix. I do want to read the next book though (I already bought it). As has been warned before this is not a book for the kids. There's blood, guts, sex, rape, decapitations...not a bed time story. And pregnant woman who may be emotional already may want to avoid it. I'm not sure there is really a ""good guy"" in this book. It's just kind of a set of families fighting with another set of families. Everyone is kind of a ""shade of grey"" in other words. No one's all the way in the right or all the way on the bad guy side. I did thoroughly enjoy the book and if you can past all the adult content mentioned above I highly recommend it.","2011-08-01","United States","","true","35","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK3PKZM3Y7AWT"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Literary Evaluation","A Song of Ice and Fire: A Game of Thrones ""When you play the game of thrones, either you win or you die. There is no middle ground"" (Martin 448). This quote from George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones captures the essence of the fantasy novel. Martin creates a medieval world that falls into turmoil after the death of King Robert Baratheon and features feuding families, fire-breathing dragons, and the mysterious ""white walkers"" who live beyond The Wall. Martin uses a complex setting, magical plot elements, and well-developed characters to bring the reader's into his world and creates an excellent fantasy novel in the process. Martin is able to create a setting so complex, it features an entirely fictional continent that the reader can't help but want to explore. He uses the experiences of the characters to introduce detailed locations. The audience journeys from The Wall cuts across the snowy North, to the lush, Mediterranean-like Riverlands of The South. Martin's descriptions can make you feel a shiver with Jon as ""the wind blew it was like a knife cutting right through his warmest woolens"" (115), or feel the rain as ""...it beat down on Ned's head, warm as blood and relentless as old guilt's"" (367). Martin is able to weave in fantastical elements that make sense to the story while thrilling his audience. As the novel opens, the reader travels with rangers of the Knight's Watch who are exploring the other side of The Wall, and encounter the Others, a supernatural race who are thought to be extinct. Martin leaves you on the edge of your seat as the rangers are killed and turned into zombie-like creatures. Martin leaves you breathless at the end of the novel as the beloved character Daenerys walks into a burning fire, only to emerge with three newly hatched dragons. Martin also creates well-developed characters that do not always fit into a typical `good vs. evil' paradigm. For example, the audience first identifies Lord Eddard Stark as a loving family man, but is confused when it is revealed that he had an affair and brings home the love child. Lord Stark is revealed to the audience as a brave leader, but later reveals that he has killed innocent people and burned cities to the ground. It is characters like these that make it hard for the audience to have just one opinion of Martin's characters; they are seen as complex people who are put in extraordinary circumstances, and allows the audience to engage in reflecting what makes a person `good' or `bad'. The world that George R. R. Martin creates in A Game of Thrones invites his readers in and challenges them to think beyond `good vs. evil'. Martin paints descriptive pictures and allows his audience to explore the terrain with his characters. He combines medieval courts with fantasy elements such as dragons and zombies. Martin creates characters that have human flaws that make them relatable even in such a fantastic setting. A Game of Thrones is an epic fantasy novel. Works Cited Martin, George R. R.

"B000QCS8TW","5","Engrossing epic fantasy","It’s been a long time since I have read anything that totally sucked you into a world of its own. And it certainly requires a lot of talent and imagination to create an alternate world, people it with unforgettable characters and fill it up with challenges that would make the reader forget the reality. George R. R. Martin’s fantasy adventure saga is just that. (It was so addictive that I thanked God for giving me this book during the holidays.) Game of Thrones begins auspiciously enough with a mysterious death, when three of the night guards venture into the forest to investigate something strange. Attacked by a mysterious man with a blue sword, a knight dies while his companions flee. The author slowly introduces important characters, their relationships with each other, past history, present folly and future dreams. Told from points of view of different characters, the story progresses slowly, yet there is no lag anywhere, no urgency or urge to skip pages. Though each of these characters inhabit different locales, the author manages to keep the tempo just right. Lord Stark also known as Ned, learns that Jon Arran, his co-brother and ‘hand’ of the King is dead. The king who was also his friend, personally arrives to make Ned as the next ‘hand’ and proposes an alliance between the crown prince and Sansa, Ned’s daughter. Left with no choice, Ned agrees to leave his holding at Winterfell and move to King’s Landing, despite his son’s accidental fall. Far away in the free cities, two siblings Vicerys and Daenerys Targaryen, the rightful heirs to the Iron Throne are destitut,e trying their best to survive and conquer their rightful heritage. Vicerys literally sells his sister Dany to Khal Drogo, a powerful nomad chief, hoping that he would provide him with an army to conquer his land. In the meanwhile, Ned finds himself surrounded by intrigues, plots and betrayal in the King’s Landing. King Robert, drunk and absent is surrounded by enemies and a hostile queen. Trying to unravel the mystery of Jon Arran’s death, Ned becomes the target of the queen, who wants get rid of him. The racy pace of the story, will keep you on the edge of the seat, making the book unputdownable. I read somewhere that the plot lines of these series, were based on the war of roses, a tumultuous period of hundred year war in English history. The author does a very commendable job of tracing the history of each family, their heirs, their marriages, alliances and their fates intertwined with that of the iron throne. The books opens a virtual box of pandora and leaves the readers with many questions that would get hopefully answered in the subsequent books. Plus Points: Great plot, perfect language, good prose and descriptions Minus Points: Too much of blood and gore. And the bad news is that it is going to get worse as the story progresses. A word of caution, don’t get attached to any character. The author might bump him off. Verdict: Addictive, engrossing and gripping.

"B000QCS8TW","4","FOR NEW READERS - Good book, but warning about series!","I finally got fed up with fan boys claiming this is the best series to ever grace the earth EVEN AFTER the last installment(s), and wanted to make a note for new readers to the Song of Fire & Ice saga. This book get's a solid 4 1/2 stars. The series as a whole after five installments, 2 stars. Basically, be prepared to enjoy the first half (Books 1-3), and wear a straight jacket for the remainder (Books 4-5). This 1st installment is a great book and definitely leaves you wanting more. While certainly not Tolkien quality as some have claimed (admitting they are different writers with different approaches), GRRM continually brings a wonderful new angle into this genre. No reason to repeat all of the positive reviews on this site (regarding any of the F&I books) since anyone looking through can get a feel for the positives... and (in the end) ultimate negatives regarding this series. And here is where new readers need to research, what is being said about books 4 & 5 BEFORE they start diving in! To the point: Books 4 & 5... rubbish. Waste of time. It was extremely painful getting through four, but I kept promising the fifth (and initially / supposedly planned as the LAST) of the series would make it all worth while as well as reach a climatic conclusion. Nope. Five was worse. Goes NO where, ties ZERO loose ends, kills any mental stimulation regarding all of the previously enjoyed characters, etc etc etc meh. And now we must wait for installment six... SEVEN as rumors now claim? I kept wondering if George Lucas had somehow gotten involved and starting adding his input on how to draw out BS sequences and potentially kill a series. Can anyone say Robert Jordan? Now, as time continues to pass, there are worries that GRRM may never even finish this series due to his making readers wait nearly 8 years for the latest installment of nothingness (and over TEN years for certain favorite characters to even have a mention). And if he were to ""rush"" the next book due to his new TV endeavor, many fear it would understandably fall short. And rush he may have to... because where the heck is the TV series going to go once they reach the fourth installment? Nobody would continue watching. And applause to GRRM for getting the TV series in motion, nothing wrong with notoriety and building upon one's passion... however fears of where it can possibly go does remain. My advice if you are looking to read this epic... WAIT until (or if) this series of novels concludes and decide what people have to say about it then. If people rave about the conclusion, GREAT! I will explain exactly as I have here. Starts fantastic. Dies, burns, & infuriates in the middle. Concludes with ...well, we will see.","2011-12-04","United States","","true","38","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4UN0EH40MFIG"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Captivating .... get ready when you listen to these stories","George R.R. Martin's ""Story of Ice and Fire"" books are becoming legend among fantasy fiction lovers. This book one ""A Game of Thrones"" ... introduces you to a truly ingeneous fictional feudal world of Lord's and Ladies as they really probably were (NASTY people)... of their ""blooded"" children and [...] children ... set in a world where summmers and winters last for a lifetime for many if not most. This story is set in a time when summer is fading to winter. The eternal struggle for the Lords is the control of the Iron Throne ... where the King of Kings resides. The Lords are heads of ""Families"" who have been at war with one another throughout their known history. The holder of the Iron Throne rules all of the ""Families"", by majority rule, essentially. Ofcourse, if the King is murdered, entranced by a sorcerer, or co-opted by a rival family marrying their son to one of the Kings supporter's daughter ... thus stealing the King's support ... perhaps enough to challenge the King for the Throne. Or, maybe the plot is to simply kill the King and all of his family at one fell swoop and sieze the Throne. Can it be held against the revenge of King's supporters? All of this and much more exist in this world, told from the viewpoints of many different Lords and ""Family"" members ... each chapter is headed by the name of the main character for the chapter... and the individual lives progress through the book in different chapters at different times in the story ... but beginning where the last chapter left off with that character ... WOW... I had to keep going back to remember where this particular character was going .... YOU CAN'T READ/LISTEN TO THESE STORIES WITHOUT BEING DRAWN IN ... SLOWLY AT FIRST ... WHICH MAKES THEM EVEN MORE ENJOYABLE. I'm now listening to the second story ... ""The Clash of Kings""... better because I already knew I was hooked on the stories... The hardest part of getting started in this book is trying to keep all of the family characters straight ... so you can understand the motivation behind their plots and schemes (plots within plots within plots... Incestious royal children acknowledged by the King as his children (wow) ... similar to understanding the early history of the Roman Empire actually ... as Machiavelli saw it in The Prince. The ends justify the means. If you enjoy the intregue of real history in a fantasy setting you'll love these stories. As for Roy Dotrice, the reader of the book I listened to, he grows on you as you progress. Being a little snobish about my favorite readers, when I first began listening I wasn't drawn into the intricacy of the story because I wasn't drawn in by the reader. When I finally started paying more attention to the story itself (because if you don't you will soon be lost) I found Dotrice's reading very well done, he has fairly good character recognition skills ... perhaps not the range of say Jim Dale or Simon Jones ... but well above average none the less...

"B000QCS8TW","4","**** ½ - A Pinnacle of Fantasy","I have read plenty of average fantasy in my life, so I wasn't looking forward to diving into any more eight hundred page novels that might be of a similar caliber. Strike two is that I don't generally love much of anything that's set in a medieval time period... so my expectations were low until I started reading reviews everywhere. Still hesitant at that point, I purchased this novel and was blown away. Martin is unbelievable in that he is willing to do so many things with his characters that you wouldn't expect (or want him to do), but in the long run, making big moves like these are what really create the epic moments that you won't forget anytime soon. The other major plus is that he the best in the genre at creating so many moments of tension. You just can't wait to find out where this next plot twist is going to take you... and then he moves you on to another protagonist's/antagonist's point of view. Once this story gets moving, I was constantly on the edge of losing my mind! It's nearly impossible not to skip ahead in the book to the next portion of that character's story. Overall, Martin has created a remarkably engrossing storyline with a broad cast of well-developed characters that would rival almost any work of fiction that I've read. He does pretty much everything right in this novel, however, the only reasons I don't give it a five star rating are: 1. My lack of enthusiasm of this time period in general; he does it very well, but it's still not my favorite thus bringing my enjoyment level down a notch or two 2. I didn't really learn anything from the novel. It's very fun to read, but one of the things about reading fiction, nonfiction, etc is that I love to learn from the writer. Many of my favorite authors of fiction know how to weave lots of incredible depth and emotional development into their characters that we can apply to our situations (or to other people that we've interacted with). Don't get me wrong, this is incredible writing, and I am highly recommending it to anyone that loves to read.... and if you've never read fantasy before, focus your energy here. *****___(Perfection) The highest degree of enjoyment / fulfillment I've personally experienced with reading ****½___(Excellent) Only lower than five stars due to falling short on any number of ""subjective"" categories ****____(Influential) A very satisfying experience and has me looking for more from this writer/genre ***½____(Good) Keeps me engaged but unlikely to look for more by this writer unless highly recommended ***_____(Average) Could take it or leave it and will not be looking for more by the same writer **______(Poor) Constantly asking myself, ""How much worse can this get?"" every few minutes *_______(Terrible) Belongs in the dumpster...

"B000QCS8TW","5","Really Enjoying the Story","I mostly review independent books in this spot, but a lot of times I am reading other things as well that I don’t review. I recently revisited a bunch of Robert Heinlein books I had not read in years, I’m currently on a Game of Thrones kick and this leads to somewhat erratic posting. So I thought I would just start reviewing whatever it is that I read and readers can decide whether they want to view it or not. Anyway, on with the book. I did a marathon of the HBO series before starting on the books. I was not a follower from the beginning, but during a particularly long and cold week this winter I watched the whole series up to where the current season would start. I really enjoyed the TV series, but was curious what tidbits might have been left out from the written version. There are always differences between a TV series and the books, nuances that you miss, foreshadowing and outright changes to the story though I do have to say that the first season of the series was pretty much right to the book. I’m enjoying reading the books though sometimes the descriptions drag on a bit long for me. Of course, I’m inpatient by nature so that may not be a problem for others. The story as a whole is complex and well done. I immediately became a fan of the Stark clan and their direwolves and I’ve enjoyed every moment of the time I have spent in this fantasy realm. I suspect that I will read all of the books since I’m finishing the second one and have the third one waiting for me on my desk. The first book introduces all the characters, sets the scene for the story to come and is long enough to give you time to really get familiar with the characters and start to love or hate them as they deserve. Martin did an excellent job with this book. The characters have obvious depth and the world building was done well enough to suck me in at once. I read a lot of science fiction, but I enjoy a well crafted fantasy from time to time. There are more hints at the usual fantasy elements of magic and dark things in the first book than actual experiences for the characters with such things, more ancient tales that people wonder if they are true. I’m going to leave it there for anyone who hasn’t read the books or watched the series and would like to. Nevertheless, I’m enjoying my adventures with the characters on both sides of the Narrow Sea and hope my fascination with this world continues as I’ve had such a good time up until now.

"B000QCS8TW","4","Everything I'd been led to expect","Several friends had told me that I would LOVE G. R. R. Martin's Ice and Fire series, so I was predisposed to be impressed. I had held off reading it because a) it isn't finished - there are at least two more books yet to be written, and b) with five books already in the series, averaging 800 pages, I wanted to be sure I was ready for the commitment. After watching the first two seasons on HBO I couldn't hold out any longer - and I'm glad I didn't. The story is richly imagined and meticulously detailed, feeling more like a forgotten history than a fantasy novel. The characters, both good and bad (lots of these) are fully drawn, at least the significant ones (LOTS of these). Whether you like someone or hate them, you'll be very clear about why. The scope of this book is huge; there are Seven Kingdoms just on the first continent you encounter, and there will be at least one more. Conditions are deteriorating quickly for the residents of these lands, with war breaking out all over. Folks get taken hostage, injured, enslaved...there isn't a lot of happiness here. One thing that might be a problem for some is that each chapter is about a different character, all told in the third person. This can be a bit disorienting until you start getting the people straight (watching the TV show was a BIG help here - I already had visuals of the people). There are a LOT of characters; I suggest writing them down with a little bio. There are lists available online, but I found that seeing ALL of them at once was more overwhelming than helpful. If you write down the name, the House to which they belong, and their place of origin, it should be enough to keep you from getting too confused. Some other things that may not be to everyone's taste: the violence, the sex, and the language. Some of the things described here make ""Braveheart"" seem light and happy, the sex is plentiful, graphic, and taboo-breaking, and there are words here that, in general, I try not to even think, yet alone use. But the thing is...it works. It's awful, but in context. If these sorts of things don't generally bother you, you'll be fine. Even if they do, the strength of the writing most likely will carry you along, drawn by the need to know what becomes of Daenarys, or Arya, or Bran, or...well, you get the idea. This is a fantasy novel for those who don't generally read them - which includes me. I started (and pretty much ended) my interest in this genre with ""The Lord of the Rings"". After you've read the best, why read the rest? Well, now I know why; because there are whole new worlds out there, and they're worth exploring.","2013-04-26","United States","","true","42","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36Z6B0X0DVK8Y"

"B000QCS8TW","5","Five stars for what is and what could have been...","This is the most impressive fantasy book I've read in decades, one of the few that captured my imagination long after the book was done. People liken Mr. Martin to Tolkien, but his greatness lies in *not* being like Tolkien: not once during the book did I think of LOTR. The latter had the flavor of Arthurian legend and the old sagas; this has the much grittier feel of the Middle Ages, with real people and real politics. Pros: where to begin? The world he created is unique and wide-ranging, spanning continents and cultures. His characterizations are superb: he has a cast of hundreds, but every one stands out. His division of chapters according to viewpoint gives each character the chance to show their own personality and motivations. Interactions between characters were realistic, dialogue was natural, and people acted consistently with who they were and what they wanted. He was able to spin out 800+ pages without the plot ever dragging, and the thing kept me up late 3 nights in a row until I finished it. That was a week ago, and it's still on my mind. Cons: the first is picayune - I'm a little uncomfortable with sex scenes involving 13 year olds. Yes, child brides were/are the norm for certain cultures, but I'm still not easy with it. The notion of a 15yo boy leading men to war is even more incongruous. I just don't see a 15yo, no matter how well trained, as having the experience and judgement required to mount a large scale campaign. But these are trifles. The real problem with the book is its ending - it doesn't really have one. The whole thing is basically setup for the next book, with nothing resolved and everything left hanging. And it gives the distinct impression that the next book would do the same, and the next, and the next... It was like spending days climbing an enormous mountain, only to get to the top and see an endless vista of more mountains to climb. I was concerned enough to look at the reviews for the rest of the books in the series. Sure enough, they were of a pattern: nothing resolved, everything left hanging. Further, the author seems to have developed a sadistic streak. Killing off my favorite character was emotional punishment enough, but killing off all of them? I think he's stymied with the next book b/c he's murdered, maimed, or tortured everybody of interest, and has nobody left now to care about. So this book stands as an unfinished symphony: magnificent of itself, yet a poignant reminder of what might have been.","2010-03-17","United States","","true","46","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFBM1NGI5TMMV"
"B000QCS8TW","4","More meat less fat please","My over all impression of this book was that it was a good story with gripping characters, and a whole lotta fat! This story has an army of characters good, evil, indifferent, but all interesting enough. There have already been plenty of reviews that tell the basics plot and subplots so I will not get into that. I will say that while cumbersome, Martins does spin a very interesting tale with the right mix of drama, intrigue, humor, and romance. From an author's stand point, there probably were a lot of characters that the story did not need but for this story, adding a lot of characters for the sake of ""expanding the empire"" seemed appropriate. Here's my main problem with the book: It was far longer that it needed it to be. This book was almost 700 pages with the same length and width of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows hard cover. The print was maybe 8pt. Why was this story so long? It was not because that much happened in the book, it was because Martin over describes everything. My best example of this how he takes two and a half pages to describe an Inn that the characters are in for a few hours. Yes, a very pivotal moment happens there that may actually effect the series as a whole, but at the end of the day it is still just an Inn. My over all impression of this in was that one of the main characters spent much of her childhood there, but now it is nothing like it was. I don't remember the rest of the description, but I know what an Inn looks like in these stories. You have to realize the human mind can only retain so much at a time. Very often I found myself skipping ahead to get past information I didn't need. The one character I do want to talk about is Daenerys. I enjoyed her subplot very much. The thing is her story is one that in my opinion should have been its own story. I know there is a tie in but in my opinion it is very week. If anything her story is how she breaks away from the story going on in the seven kingdoms. I know this is a series and her story will probably tie in better as the series progresses. I would recommend this book for people who love as much detail as possible and are impressed buy how many words an author can squeeze into a chapter. For the rest of us, I am looking forward to watching the series on blue ray.","2012-05-28","United States","","true","47","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1L4H7NALVVZEZ"
"B000QCS8TW","5","I'd like to mention that though this is for the ebook ...","This book was lying on my TBR for so long, and I finally got around to reading it. Before I start with the review, I'd like to mention that though this is for the ebook version, I mostly read this via audiobook (Whispersync rocks!) and that made the whole journey a bit easier. If you find yourself intimidated by the length of this mammoth, ignore the hour count on the audiobook and get started, because Roy Doytrice is a wonderful narrator. He does some spectacular work in bringing these voices alive, though at times his bass makes it difficult to judge the age of the character. Nevertheless, with the amount of characters in the book and the range of characters he has to portray, he does a commendable job in it. As for the main story, as this is an epic novel I thought it would be slow-paced. But imagine my surprise when the author pulls you right in this world of dragons and wight walkers, and medieval politics, and a complex religious system. However, even with all the world-building, nowhere did I feel there was a info dump going on, because the world of A Song of Ice and Fire is constructed slowly, character by character, backstory by backstory and myth by myth. It can feel drawn out at times, but since I had the knowledge of the plot from the show, I knew almost every plot arc was leading up to something. It makes for a very involved and complex plotline, one that involves many regions, languages, and belief systems. A slight problem I had with the book was the overabundance of characters. Especially the endless parade of knights and houses and lords being mentioned, when I had no idea who would be significant. And considering how much plot happens, even if a character is called back later on in a subsequent book, I wouldn't even realize. Another is the misogyny, and subtle racism in the book - for this book only, the lone explicitly POC race (the Dothraki) is depicted as barbaric and monstrous. And no, even if Dany loved Khal Drogo, I cannot condone a character who proudly vows to rape the women of his enemies (amongst all the killing and plundering) in his conquest of the Seven Kingdoms. Granted it is made to be realistically fantasy, it still irks me how sexual violence is often a plot device in books. Content warning for sexual abuse, violence, coarse language, incest (gods, this is a long list).","2017-05-25","United States","","true","48","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M8RU217M8EFZ"
"B000QCS8TW","5","""Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice.""","Most people nowadays are quite familiar with the TV series ""Game of Thrones,"" but how do the books differ from the adaptation? I think it's important to know that one of the major factors that drove George R. R. Martin to write his ""A Song of Ice & Fire"" series was his frustration as a television screenwriter with producers telling him that his ideas had to be pared down due filming logistics and budget. With this series, he set out to tell the grandest, most ambitious story that he could conjure: pure imagination unfettered by deadlines and production costs. The series was always intended to start with a narrow focus, then expand to a much grander scale, then close back in for the dramatic conclusion. So, pretty much any adaptation of this ever-growing mega-story is going to have to make some drastic chops and changes. Because Book One here finds the story at its smallest and tightest, though, the TV adaptation is fairly close to the source material in its first season. That said, there are some major adaptational decisions that set the show apart from the books right from the get-go. With very few exceptions, the show runners decided not to rely on flashbacks, dreams, prophecies, or any internal monologue. This is in stark contrast to the book material, which revels in the world of the internal. The show also eschews the books' strict adherence to limited third person points of view for a more omniscient telling of the events. While the adaptation is most concerned with spectacular events concerning the world's most powerful figures, ""A Game of Thrones"" tends to focus on how the actions and policies of powerful figures affect those without much power. In other words, it's about consequences and blow back rather than about the spectacle itself. The limited points of view also make for great repeat reads, as the narrators are all unreliable in some way or another. Martin is not a cynic as some like to think, but he certainly makes the point that heroism is often thankless, progress is stilted and compromised, conflict is hard to resist, and peace is a very fragile thing. Overall, there's a haunting quality to a lot of the story, and a gnawing sense of horror, rather than the saucy intrigue of the show. While it's excellent reading even upon multiple re-reads, ""A Game of Thrones"" is probably my least favorite of the series so far, as it occasionally features some awkward ideas or stiff prose. Thankfully these problems vanish in Book Two, and the beauty of Martin's writing grows with every work he releases.","2016-07-24","United States","","true","49","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HU0239NO4MBE"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Swords, Kings and Dragons","After seeing the previews for Game of Thrones on HBO in the weeks leading up to the premier episode on 4/17/2011, Game of Thrones looked like your typical Medieval times storyline full of knights in shining armor, sword fights, debauchery and that kind of stuff. I was somewhat disinterested...until a few days before the premier I happened to catch a making-of Game of Thrones production. So I set my DVR and I'm glad that I did. Game of Thrones was one of the best things on TV in 2011. It was so good that I purchased the book to get the source's perspective, and after finishing the book I'd say that the HBO adaptation of Game of Thrones kept the storyline about 98% intact with very few liberties. It was great to read the book after seeing the show to be able to put faces with all of the names. The standout descrepany from book to screen is the age of many of the prime characters. I guess that in a book it's okay to write about tennagers commiting acts of violence, having sex or worse getting raped, but apparantly HBO thought a lot of that would land them in hot water on the screen. And they would probably be correct. Game of Thrones is a very long read with a ton of words, side stories and descriptions that could have been left out without affecting the story at all. In fact as I look at some of the reviews for some of the subsequrent books it's a common complaint by fans. But I was glued to every bit of this first in the series and I'm a few chapters into the second in the series called A Clash of Kings. Game of Thones sets the stage for the rest of the epic series and introduces what I'm guessing will be the key players. Although who knows based on the surprising demise of some characters that you'd have thought would ""never die"" by the end of Game of Thrones. What's clear is that war lies in the future and the book details the violent struggles among the land's controlling families and kingdoms. And as there will evidently be more than just human encounters to deal with in the struggles for power as A Clash of Kings and the rest of the story unfolds. I'm hooked on A Song of Ice and Fire, and I'll be done with Clash of Kings prior to the second HBO season which is a nice reversal of order. Don't miss this series if you're into the action/fantasy genre.","2011-12-13","United States","","true","50","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AJKA2DV3WUHB"
"B000QCS8TW","4","Excellent story, but too many characters to wade through","I really enjoyed this book. It is a fabulous story with rich, fully-developed characters and world building unmatched by any author I have read, with the exceptions of Tolkien and J.K. Rowling. Mr. Martin is a brave and ruthless author, as he has the guts to do what many authors do not: make their characters suffer! I respect that. Tyrion, Jon, and Eddard were my favorite characters. Arya is a close fourth. Viseyrs was my least favorite, and if someone tosses Lady Lysa off a cliff in one of the upcoming books, I won't lose any sleep. The criticisms: This book was ridiculously long, and it's not exactly a page-turner. The book gets interesting at about 50% completion, and takes off at abut 70% (the point where things change drastically, for Eddard (Ned)). The ending is well worth the wait; just know that with the exemption of the first few chapters, the middle of act one and middle of act two is going to be a slog. Also, there are just too many darn characters in this book! Yes, this is an epic fantasy with characters that cover the entire realm, but I don't think that every lord, maester, hired sword, and bannerman needed be asigned a name--it was dizzying. There were so many sers, lords and lady mothers that I just had no idea who was who, outside of the main characters (the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, the two living Tarygarens and a few of the Dothraki). I would be reading a scene, and in comes Ser Such and Such. Ser Such and Such has joined the conversation, confusing things because I haven't the slightest idea who this person is. Who's side is this person on? What is their motivation for their actions at this point of the story? Are they credible? Are they to be trusted? I don't know, because they hadn't been mentioned in 150 pages, and they weren't significant enough for me to remember anything other than I had heard their name in the story before. That is my major complaint in this story. Overall, I am glad I read A Game of Thrones. The last 30% of the book was worth the long read! At this point I am not certain if I will read the next installment, only because the books are so long, and there is a critically acclaimed TV series that has supposedly done a good job in portraying the story. I think I'll go the easy route and watch the series.","2014-08-10","United States","","true","51","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RV32GTQJCAC1H"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Best book I ever read.","I originally read this many years ago and recently decided to do a reread and it's as awesome as I remember. I've never read a book that the author has invested so much time and thought into the back story. The world comes to life so vividlyvwhen I read this book and it's not because there is a TV show that I can base it on. It's from his rich and descriptive writing. I never read a book or a series like this before. I like fantasy but I go more towards the urban fantasy side of things. I do like to read about past monarchs and so that's what had originally drew me to this book. I had heard it was going to be a show on HBO and people were excited so I bought the book to try it out. My first read through I read it in two days. Stayed up all night reading. Needless to say I missed some things so that's why while I'm waiting the neverending wait til book 6 comes out all the while avoiding spoilers from the TV show, I devided to reread and see if it was as good as I believed. It's better! There are so many fawning reviews that I'm sure my review will be lost in the middle but if someone does ever read this wondering is it worth it. It is. It truly is. This first book especially is awesome. It's seems overwhelming with its cast of characters but it's not. This book sets the tone and introduces you to the main characters of the book or are they? Noone safe in these books. Noone. I will say that this book, this series, totally deserves five stars. I think of some books that I've given 5 or 4 stars to in the past and then care it to this book and they aren't even I'm the same league at all. The series has some harsh critics and as the series goes on some of their observations are correct. But as far as the first book, it's as near a perfect book that I've read. It is violent. Very violent. Be prepared for that and a lot of rape and pillaging.

"B000QCS8TW","4","Those willing to tolerate an certain level of: vulgarity, domestic violence, rape, sexual exploitation of children, incest...","and murder will likely find this to be a pretty good read. I purchased Game of Thrones because of its popularity with Amazon.com readers, thinking that my 12-year-old bookworm son, a fan of fantasy, might like it. Fortunately, I decided to preview it before handing it off to him, during which I quickly realized that I was wrong. The book's mature themes and graphic descriptions of violence place it squarely in a category best left for adults. Although fantasy is not a genre I generally seek out, I found Mr. Martin's storytelling utterly entertaining, in spite of its above average level of brutality, the descriptions of which left me feeling nearly queasy. The author develops his cast of over 200 characters well and is somehow able to flawlessly keep track of the extreme number of interrelationships required to put together a compelling story about, as the title says, the ""game of thrones,"" a phrase characters use throughout the book. Thankfully for readers, the author includes an appendix cataloguing the seven different families, their relative relationships, and other relevant information, which should not be referred to unless absolutely necessary as it includes some spoilers. The book's hook, provided in the prologue is intriguing; members of the Night's Watch have a run-in with some otherworldly characters. Its first chapter is told from the perspective of Brandon ""Bran"" Stark, the seven-year-old son of Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell, in which he sees his first execution. In the second, Eddard's wife, Lady Catelyn learns that her sister's husband, Jon Arryn has died under suspicious circumstances. Eddard Stark suspects the king, a longtime friend, will ask that he accept the responsibility of becoming the King's Hand. The author spends the rest of the 600 plus pages spinning an intricately plotted tale, alternately told from the perspectives of these former three, plus two of Bran's sisters, his half brother, a spunky little person named Tyrion Lannister, and a brave, proud 13-year-old named Princess Daenerys. The ""game"" involves such things as: honor, violence, betrayal, revenge, the consumption of an entire uncooked horse's heart (as well as fermented mare's milk ""thick with clots""), and to top it off...sex between siblings. In summary, readers who enjoy fantasy and can tolerate the bad behavior that tends to go along with warring royalty, will likely find Game of Thrones to be a thoroughly entertaining story. Also good: Watership Down by Richard Adams, The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, and The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.","2011-09-03","United States","","true","53","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R387AN3POSSNQF"
"B000QCS8TW","5","All Encompassing, Fantastic Novel","I really enjoyed this novel and look forward to reading the rest in this series. This is an all encompassing, fantastic novel, in which Martin creates a vividly detailed alternate world. In this world, there are 3 main groups: the Others who live in the frigid snowlands, the Dothraki who resemble American Plains Indians, and the Kingdoms of Westeros who resemble Medieval Europe. The author gives great detail to the traditions and culture of the Dothraki and Westeros, giving them the feeling being real people and real places. Not much detail is given about the mysterious Others in this novel, although they are featured in a few of the side stories. Adding to the real-worldness of this novel, are the many different characters that are developed, and the different story lines happening through out the book. An overarching theme of the book is political intrigue, as we learn that the current King Robert took the throne by force, that brother Viserys and his sister Daenerys are the only 2 survivors of the previous king's lineage and of their plot to retake the throne, the Dothraki enlisted to help them who are afraid of the sea and have no desire to enter Westeros, the Night Watch who dedicate their lives to protecting Westeros from the Others and mythical creatures which many people believe no longer exist. The characters in this book are many and varied. The book takes the format of each chapter being from the view of a different character, which helps organize the different plot lines. The characters are diverse and well-developed, and we see their flaws, as well as their abilities. I did really like the unique names and common names with unique spelling, that Martin gave the characters. One minor flaw, the author throws in many made-up words, and while this adds to the flavor of the alternate world, it can make it difficult to discern what is being said in some places. One caution for younger or more sensitive readers, this book does contain a lot of graphic violence (including against children), a scene describing a dark magic ritual, incest and rape (including a scene that alludes to a pre-pubescent girl being sent to a house of prostitution.) Given all that, this book is definitely not for everyone, but for people who enjoy lengthy novels they can fully delve into, this book is one of the best.","2018-08-11","United States","","true","54","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16V6HM02CFAW7"
"B000QCS8TW","4","The first book of a massive series","I had heard of A Game of Thrones through the reputation of the HBO series. I don't have an HBO subscription, so I don't plan to watch it. But I thought it might be fun to read the book. The novel isn't quite as focused on sex as the series is supposed to be. It has its share of both sex and violence, but all of the titillating aspects of the plot are justified in the written version. This is not a medieval Shades of Gray. The plot is a massive story with more characters than I could keep track of. There is a listing of names in an appendix at the back. If I had known it was there, I would have taken advantage of it and that might have helped. But the main characters were well defined and whatever confusion I had with the minor ones didn't affect my appreciation of the work. The story takes place during medieval times, in a world populated with lords, ladies, knights, and peasants. The fictional environment created by George R. R. Martin is realistically portrayed, but it branches off into mystical moments that are critical to the story. The shift from realism to mysticism is handled smoothly and fits well in the context of the story. The majority of the plot concerns the relationship of Eddard (Ned) Stark with King Robert Baratheon and the conflict between Ned's family, the house of Stark and the family of the King's wife Cersei, the house of Lannister. There is intrigue, deception, jousting, battles, and everything else expected from a story about a struggle for power in that period. I loved the excitement as the various plots progressed. The one thing I did not like about A Game of Thrones is that it doesn't stand on its own. Multiple subplots were left hanging when the book ended. I understand that it is part of a series, but it should still conclude the majority of the story lines. I want to know what happens to Arya and how Jon will fit in. Leaving something up in the air makes sense to me, but this book leaves too much unresolved. I plan to read the other books in the series, but I don't know how soon I'll get to them.

"B000QCS8TW","5","Wow","What else can I say? I only started reading this book because I wanted to be familiar with the characters before I started watching the TV show. Well. My only experience with epic fantasy is with Tolkien and Jordan. I was a little hesitant to step into GoT because WoT became too ponderous to wade through by the sixth or seventh book. It took only a few chapters reading ASOFAI to where I would hold my breath at the end of a chapter before I pushed the Next Page button to see who the next chapter would be about. Some chapters I had to hold my hand over the page so I wouldn't read the bottom before the top! As I stated various places before, GoT is like WoT but with a fourth of the words, four times the action, and a fifth less magic. In other words, once I got past the introduction of the main players and who was married to whom, keeping track of who was doing what where and for or to whom, was not hard. Martin's fantasy world seems like a very real place in many ways. As usual thousands of years ago people came over on ships and conquered, then intermarried. The laws of physics and medicine are the same. Soon I was reading the book just to find out what was going to happen regardless of what the tv show was doing. There is a lot of violence and sex in this book, but I never felt it that was gratuitous. Yes bad things happen to good people in Westeros. Knowing that no character is safe ups the ante. Reading on the Kindle helps when I want to look up a character and see when we first met him or her, learn the meaning of an archaic word. From the first four episodes of the TV show, I can see that the script came right of the book. The TV show is great - the very first scene of men riding forth from the Wall, told me they ""got it"" when they made this TV series. People will be drawn in the visuals - of towers, cities, massed armies. And of course, all the gratuitous sex. The TV show will bring lots of new readers to these books. As great as the TV show is, the book is just so much better. If the show gets people to actually read these books, they will be pleasantly surprised.","2011-07-03","United States","","true","56","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35M7U79M9USNH"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Still the best after all these years","I first read George R.R. Martin's A Game of Thrones back in 1997, just after I graduated from college -- I had completed Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time (to that point), and was enticed by the Jordan blurb on the cover of the paperback. Combined with a fondness for George R.R. Martin's short stories and Wild Cards series as a teenager, I knew I should give it a chance. I remember being up late at my mother's house in the height of winter, feeling an odd chill as I finished the prologue, impressed by the mix of fantasy and horror. Of course, with its rich cast of characters, focus on politics, and subtle approach to magic, A Game of Thrones is much more than its prologue. In many ways, A Game of Thrones represents a tremendous paradigm shift in fantasy. Characters are flawed, and central figures -- even protagonists -- can die horribly. We may take this for granted now, but in the late 1990's, fantasy was still largely wed to the Tolkien model. Not so after A Game of Thrones. Robert Jordan, David Eddings, Terry Brooks, et al, all seemed adolescent in comparison to Martin. I have since gone back and read it six times over the past 14 years -- whenever a firm date is announced for a new volume of a Song of Ice and Fire, I go back and re-read all the books in the series. The recent announcement of A Dance With Dragons for July 2011 is no different -- except this time, I'm reading the series on my Kindle and not in print. Fortunately, the typography and art translates well on the platform, and reading it on Kindle is very similar to reading it in print. Even knowing the story as well as I do, including through a recent screening of the first six episodes of the HBO television adaptation, I find there's still much to enjoy. The tragedy that befalls Ned Stark and his children is still as great as it was on first reading -- and the hindsight of the later books only helps to underline this. For many years, I have tried to find fantasy series that can compare, and though some come close, none have been able to match A Game of Thrones. And as good as the television series is, the source material is still better. If you're still on the fence, you really have no excuse. Read it. And don't complain about the Kindle price -- it's worth the $9.","2011-04-21","United States","","true","57","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KO839HDS2JLE"
"B000QCS8TW","3","Great Read that Leaves You Feeling Icky","I feel dishonest only giving this book 3 Stars because the truth is I could not put it down and there is no doubt in my mind that I will end up reading this entire series. I enjoyed the complexity of the plots, the character development, the multiple perspectives, the detailed worlds, the unconventional blur between good/evil and the unpredictable plot twists. There is much in this book to enjoy and praise. That said I only gave this book 3 stars because it left me feeling, well, kind of disturbed. Multiple times, during the course of reading this book, I told whoever was around that I felt like I was being emotionally abused by the author. I usually like disturbing/dark stories but something about this one troubled me. For starters the sex and sexual violence in this book was a bit much for me. Almost all the sex scenes are about a thirteen year old child. The sexual acts that happen to Dany in this novel constitute at least a dozen felonies in any civilized society. Not only could I not discern a reason the author had to make Dany SO young (especially if he wanted her character to be highly sexualized) but the aspects of sex he chose to discribe and the manner in which he discribed them were random, weird and came across as nothing more than a perverted indulgence. I would read something and simultaneously roll my eyes while feeling an icky shudder up and down my spine. I have no problems with sex in books I read, but the manner in which the sex scenes were written in this book are not reflective of real life and left me feeling grossed out. They felt exploitive I guess because they were so gratutious and strange. Also, as a women, the constant rape and violence towards women was hard to read. I realize rape and misogyny are part of the world, particularly in times of war, but the amount and detail was hard to stomach. While the male characters (good and bad) generally die or get injured bravely in battle the women must be systemically humiliated before dying unceremoniously. Not only is raping them bad enough, they must be gang raped. And just in case gang rape wasn't degrading enough they have to be gang raped from behind. This combined with the constant womanizing of the main characters, the constant put downs related to the worth of women relative to men and after a while it makes you start to wonder; has Martin created a world filled with systemic female degradation because he is laying the foundation for an ultimate commentary on oppression, violence and human dignity? Or has he created a world filled with female degradation because that is what he likes writing about? I have 6 more books to read before I can answer that question but I have a suspicion it is the latter which is where the icky feeling I have towards this book comes from. Hopefully, it turns out I am wrong. Even though this book left a bad taste in my mouth in some respects, I will continue to read the series because it is wildly entertaining. I've already started the second book.","2007-09-26","United States","","true","58","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LWLIE4G9KMMD"
"B000QCS8TW","4","""In life, the monsters win.""","One of the most intriguing aspects of George R. R. Martin's epic fantasy series A Song of Fire and Ice may also be its most annoying. The first novel in the series, A Game of Thrones, often gets bogged down in the very description needed to create the vaguely medieval setting. Needless to say, the fantasy genre requires patience, and luckily this book delivers to those willing to overlook (or perhaps skim) some of the more overblown parts to be rewarded by the author's knack for spinning an unparalleled plot. The heart of the story boils down to the struggle for political domination as well as the more intimate struggles between families, friends, and lovers. The chapters alternate limited third-person viewpoints of a cast of approximately 20 different characters and the author doesn't play favorites. At any given moment George R. R. Martin may kill off an important character because that is how the cutthroat world of the novel works; fan favorites be damned. Surprisingly, the novel contains a wealth of strong female characters whose presence creates a fuller picture of the factors that contribute to a struggle for world domination on a planet where the Stark family motto, ""Winter is coming,"" adds a layer of complexity to the prospect of a cold spell that could last years and with it bring even darker times for humanity as well. The thematic element most integral to the foundation of the Fire and Ice series comes toward the end of A Game of Thrones when Sansa, Eddard Stark's daughter thinks, ""In life, the monsters win."" What George R. R. Martin's fantasy series makes clear is that within everyone there is a monster and the reader will be continually torn by which character to side with. Luckily, the saga continues, and each reader will see a bit of themselves in the strengths and weaknesses of each character. The temptation to read A Game of Thrones arose only after a marathon session of watching all of the first season via HBO on Demand before the premiere of this April's season two premiere. It will be interesting to see how my perception of the series changes if I am able to read the third book BEFORE the premiere of the series' third season (which is said to only cover half of book three). In the meantime, I'll find some great fan sites and devote some time to studying character descriptions and plot summaries!

"B000QCS8TW","5","Changed the fantasy genre for me!","This book was one of the best I've read in a long time. I have never really been into the fantasy genre, but this changed that for me. Where I found ""Lord of the Rings"" hard to read and get into, I found this book to be the complete opposite of that. The way this book is done was different than I was used to. For starters, there are no chapter numbers. This drove me crazy at first, especially since I like to talk about the book with my friend. We always have to say ""That part where so-and-so did such-and-such"". It would have been nice to be able to say ""Chapter 14, towards the end"" instead. But really, that's my only real complaint about this book. Another thing that was different is that the story is told from the perspective of several different characters in the book, and each chapter is a different character, and later on that character is revisited by more chapters. This took some getting used to on my part, as did the vast number of characters. I actually had to print up a chart to help me organize who was who and who was related to who, but my short term memory isn't very good. The author's writing skill is good, in my opinion. This is something that matters to me after reading some other books where the story was good but the writing skill was bad. I don't let bad writing skill keep me from a good story, but it can be distracting. Thankfully, the author of this book writes well enough that I was able to slip right into the world that is created in the book. And oh, what a world it is. The book is just descriptive enough that you can immerse yourself and reality slips away around you. The characters are developed nicely and the plots (both the main one and the sub plots) are interesting and at times, surprising. Definitely not ""light reading"" by any means, yet vastly enjoyable. This book was really a feast for the brain, and it has totally change my opinion about the fantasy genre and has inspired me to give Lord of the Rings another try someday soon. But for now, I am eager to jump into the next book in this series, because it definitely leaves you wanting more.

"B000QCS8TW","5","Price-y for an e-book, but oh so worth it.","Though A GAME OF THRONES: A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is a little pricey for an ebook that was published in 2003 (clocking in at $8.99 at my time of purchase), it is very much worth every penny. Anyone who has watched the HBO series of the same name will benefit greatly from reading this novel. The first season of the television series closely follows the general plot and smaller details of the first book (even sometimes ripping dialogue straight from the pages of the book), but offers more insight into the characters. I watched the first two seasons and then decided to pick up the first book. I was pleasently surprised to see that the book's chapters (which are not numbered, which is its only negative, if I had to nitpick) plop you right in the mind of the chapter's namesake. It almost feels like you're watching the show as you read. The KEY difference being: You are inside the character's head. You see things more intimately through them and get a better feel of their personality, feelings, and thoughts. Aside from the improved POV, there are still some small plot differences and details that will keep the reader interested if they've already seen the show. It is a great augmentation to the television series. If you have trouble keeping all of the houses and sigils and mottos in order while watching the series, you'll have no problem after reading the book. Something interesting that struck me nearly right away is that all of the characters are significantly younger in the book than they are portrayed in the series. I suppose it goes against U.S. law to have minors do some of the things their would-be characters do in the book, so that doesn't bother me too much. If anything, it makes you sympathize with these characters' tribulations more. If you have not watched the HBO series yet, reading this book before watching the series would be a great help. There are A LOT of characters from many houses and with many different agendas. Having background knowledge from the book would help. The book is interesting and colorful and keeps you hanging on its every word. Excellent for male and female readers a like (there's something for everyone). This would be an excellent read at the beach or poolside.","2012-06-18","United States","","true","61","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KDP81UK1H2F8"
"B000QCS8TW","4","Solid Work","I have read only this first book in the series, but what I've seen so far has encouraged me to continue. I'll have to say that the most unusual feature of this book is the body count--not that it is excessive or gory, but that with it, the author kills off three major characters well before the end. And one of them was a character through whom Martin had been carrying one of the multiple points of view. Of the surviving characters, my least favorite is Joffrey, not just because he is an awful person but also because he is relentlessly awful. Counterbalancing him is Tyrion Lannister, who is crafty but clear eyed; my intuition tells me that as his fate goes, so will the currents that drive the rest of the characters in this book. Of course, any epic fantasy has to draw at least one comparison to Tolkien's _Lord of the Rings_. The biggest point, I think, is the feel of the worlds that the authors have created. To me, Tolkien's world seemed completely organic, as if the story had grown out of the ground, and the author had harvested it. The complexity of the races, languages, history, calendars--in many ways, the appendix at the end of _The Return of the King_ is the most fascinating reading of the whole series. _Game of Thrones_, on the other hand, feels completely artificial, as if the author has set the characters down on a flat surface, wound their keys, and let them tumble as they may. Despite the eight-thousand-year history behind the story's current action, I sense a chasm between those times that has not yet been bridged. I'm not saying that this is a problem with the work. In one important way, Martin's world has a big advantage over Tolkien's: his characters are free to decide their own fates. If the deaths of three major characters in the first book doesn't tell the reader that anything goes, I don't know what will. In contrast, the characters in Tolkien's world are fated--fated to fight the big battles, fated to meet the most despicable villain of all, fated to win despite enormous odds. Tolkien's world, for all of its organic feel, has artificial action, while Martin's world, for all of its artificial feel, has natural action. I look forward to seeing who survives the second book.","2013-10-28","United States","","true","62","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAZZHUUJYGZNP"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Simply Captivating...","It is difficult to offer this book praise that hasn't already been offered, but I would feel remiss not to chime in as this is without question one book among the best I've ever read. The book is structured so that within the main story, there are a large number of other stories, each reliant upon a specific character. What the book amounts to is a collection of stories about a large cast of specific and very deeply developed characters that, when taken as a whole, begin to paint a picture of the larger ""story-behind-the-story."" Each individual chapter of the book rises into climax and resolution, giving it the feel of constant action and tension, while continuously setting up future conflicts. The main story doesn't resolve, and in fact deepens just as the book concludes, paving the way for what promises to be an explosive second volume. I'll wrap up with a few comments to respond to some of the reviews I read before starting this book: 1. There is a good bit of sex, and some profanity, but only as seems necessary to establish traits and personalities of the main characters. Although at times graphic, these parts are not drawn out or dwelt upon and are not typically made to be focal points of the story. They are accessories for the sake of characterization, doing their job well, driving the reader to deeper love/hate of the character involved. 2. Anyone who says that the plots don't resolve doesn't understand the structure of the book. This isn't one story. It is many that are interwoven. 3. There are indeed ALOT of major characters, and at first it seems daunting to try to get to know them all and keep track of who is doing what. Trust me when I say this resolves very quickly as you get to know the characters and their houses and involve yourself with their lives. This is what makes this book rich. It is a depth I've not seen in any other novel I've read. 4. The book leaves much to interpretation. Being character driven, you will love some characters, and you will hate some. The beauty is that, much as in real life, the choices are left up to you. There is no real ""good guy/bad guy"" here. I find that within the same houses there are family members that I truly love, and those that so anger me I can almost experience them tangibly. I can't say enough about this book. It is the most deeply developed, emotionally moving, heart stirring, adrenalin pumping, vastly entertaining, beautifully and classicly written piece of modern literate art I have read in a very, very long time. Just wow.","2006-09-02","United States","","true","63","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HTG3088V6BQ4"
"B000QCS8TW","5","A masterful opening book to a series...","I stumbled upon A Game of Thrones in 1997 when I walked by it and saw a quote on the cover from Jordan. I liked Jordan and was really getting in to the genre so I thought why not. It is perhaps one of the best random selections of a book/series that I have ever had, and since then am a die hard Martin fan (being one of my top two authors of the genre, the other being Erikson). I'd recently had the pleasure of re-reading this one because of the HBO series as well as the fact that A Dance With Dragons was coming out. The book does not disappoint, never has. The second go around, around 14 years after I first read it, was just as special as when I read it the first time. The characters are so fleshed out and real that you can imagine them existing in real life. The honorable yet stoic Starks in the North, protecting the realm from an age old, almost mythical threat. The sinister and greedy Lannisters conniving for power. The gluttonous King Baratheon who was once a proud and formidable knight. The homeless Targaryen siblings feeling their way through an alien land yearning to return in triumph. Let us not forget all the lesser houses and noblemen, the characters that help make Martin's world so colorful and alive. You cannot help but hate Jaime and Cersei, respect Eddard, and admire Tyrion's wit. And yet despite all of this Martin writes everything in a way that leaves you wondering and doubting about how you feel about them. He isn't afraid to kill off characters and illustrate political intrigue with a deft hand. You finish A Game of Thrones shaking your head in anger or pumping your fist. You finish A Game of Thrones feeling content, and yet you suddenly want to read the next in the series to find out what happens. Treat yourself to Martin and immerse yourself in the lush, vibrant world. 5 stars. PS The only possible downside that some readers suggest is that there are too many characters and that it gets too confusing. I strongly feel that this style of writing, where each chapter follows a specific character's point of view (rotating through about 7 characters) only makes the narrative that much stronger.","2011-07-19","United States","","true","64","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3N9TB0IPO5QKW"

"B000QCS8TW","5","An Apple A Day Will Keep A Good Book Away","I read the review below by 'Apple' and felt the need to respond. Female characters in these novels are anything but whores, burly inn-maids and manly women. They are fierce, passionate and devoted characters with a drive and determination that often eclipses that of men. Examples follow: Catelyn Stark: A proud and honorable woman who has a commanding presence and a passionate heart. Even with her admirable traits, which are countless, you can't completely love her, for she holds a deep seeded hatred for her bastard step-child, Jon Snow, who is very undeserving of this. Queen Cersei: A cruel villian plotting to have her son on the throne, her manipulations are intelligent and evil, far beyond anything that a common bar whore could come up with. Sansa Stark: A prude at first who blossoms into the image of her mother and as of book four has yet to be deflowered, thus making her not a whore. Ayra Stark: A tomboy who looks like her father and later joins a mysterious guild. She holds a terrible grudge against so many people, reciting all of their names to inspire her every day. Also, not a whore. Lysa Arryn: Sister to Catelyn and slightly crazed, who sees the plot of the Lannisters, but isolates herself in her mountain home and coddles her sickly and bizarre son. Oh, and not a whore. Daenerys: A princess to a lost line of kings, who is regularly beaten into submission by her power hungry and insane brother and marries to bring him the crown (the result of which needs to be read, for her brother does get a crown, but not the one he hoped). She is perhaps one of the most powerful and enduring female charchters of all time. Also, not a whore, she is a Queen. All of these women are strong, intelligent and beautifully crafted characters who add nothing but depth to a wonderfully told story. This series takes a while because it's good. Other worlds release two books a year and those books are childish, good vs. evil cliches that never stick with you. These books have meat, and they are a joy to read. With HBO optioning to make a series of the novels and GRRM eagerly anticipating them, I don't see this series going unfinished. It will take time, but it will be finished. Do not rob yourself of the experience. He is a self made author, and I'd promote myself as much as possible if I could as well. He has done nothing more than show a love for his world and share it with his readers. I think 'Apple' is sadly unable to enjoy the quality before her.","2007-05-01","United States","","true","66","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OTDURQMKZ8C2"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Dense But Extremely Rewarding, Even After Seeing the HBO Show","Like many others, my first exposure to A Game of Thrones was the excellent HBO television series. After watching through the third season and hearing people get into heated debates about beloved and hated characters, departures from the book and predicted future events, I decided to begin reading Martin's series myself. I must say that it has been a very satisfying experience reading this first book, despite the fact that I already knew what was going to occur. While the show does a great job at portraying events, reading the book will make the history of Westeros and the motivations behind the characters' actions much more clear. Faces and names that run together on TV become much more distinct as you read about the individuals themselves, their houses, their religions and their culture. I found this to be particularly true for secondary ""brute"" characters like Sandor and Gregor Clegane, Bronn, Yoren and others. (Heck, I even sometimes found Jon Snow, Theon Greyjoy and Robb Stark difficult to tell apart on my first run through the TV show, too, but maybe that was just lazy viewing.) Martin's book also has no ""budget"" limitations, so there are quite a few passages here - dreams, direwolves, and an intense battle - that come across much more spectacularly than they do in the HBO show. To state the obvious, this is not a book for youngsters, nor is it ""light"" reading. Grim events unfold one after the other and your favorite characters will die (yes, even here in book one). You'll also have to keep track of well over one hundred characters, consult the appendix in the back, and reread passages to get the full effect of the narrative. Even so, none of it comes off as unnecessary complication but rather a rich tapestry where every detail has its purpose. In summary, I'd highly recommend this book to everyone, no matter whether you are deep into the TV series or are merely interested in seeing what all the hype is about in the first place. And I'm looking forward to moving on to book 2 in the series!","2014-07-13","United States","","true","67","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RANZG9XGKG5ND"
"B000QCS8TW","5","This book is for anyone who loves a gripping story -- no exceptions.","What could be said about Game of Thrones, the first of George R.R. Martin's epic series, that hasn't been said a million times? It's absolutely brilliant. Going into these books (I read them after the show began but before I'd seen the show...), I enjoyed my share of sci-fi/fantasy along the lines of Harry Potter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer... fairly light-hearted stuff (in comparison, at least) that always felt grounded in the same world I live in. The one genre I really disliked was ""Middle Ages Fantasy"" as I called it. Lord of the Rings, for instance, while the films were visually appealing, was not my cup of tea... too detached from reality. So when I first saw articles and clips from the HBO Game of Thrones series, I thought it looked like the one type of fantasy series that I would never enjoy. I held out for a looong time, until 3 different friends of mine with similar tastes in books/shows/films promised me that, while they too disliked this sub-genre of fantasty, this series was different, and I HAD to read the books or start the show. Grudgingly, I picked up the first book, figuring that I'd push myself half-way through it and let me friends know I tried and they were totally wrong. Of course they weren't wrong. What George R.R. Martin has done here defies genre, period. It doesn't matter if you're like me and don't care for this sub-genre of fantasy... it doesn't matter if your like my spouse, and don't like fantasy at all. If you enjoy brilliant, incredibly-developed, thought-provoking stories... those with a strongly developed cast of characters who blissfully lack being ""good vs. evil"" and instead all display their shades of grey, good traits, evil traits, unique traits, all sorts of traits... then this book is for you. Buy it. Open it up. Start reading. You won't regret it.","2015-06-22","United States","","true","68","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R9F30E5L9FAJ"
"B000QCS8TW","5","What a book!","I am typically a Mystery/Suspense novel snob. Rarely have I varied my path from those books, but more and more recently I have been making the switch. At a time when mystery novels have nearly ceased to excite me, I have needed to look elsewhere. I would have never expected to find comfort in the arms of Sci-fi/Fantasy, yet here I am before you. I have read The Lord of the Rings, but my experience beyond has been disappointing. A few years ago, at the urging of a friend I picked up a copy of The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan, Book 1 of the Wheel of Time series. My first non-Tolkien Sci-fi/Fantasy experience was a bust. It probably took me a week if not more to read the first 13 pages. Try though I might, I could not find myself lost in Jordan's world. At 832 pages, it was not a book I wanted to take my time and give a truly fair chance. Needless to say that I was hesitant when the recommendation came to try the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin. Same friend as before to make the recommendation, but this time he let the book speak for itself. A Game of Thrones spoke loudly to me. I actually read the first however many pages right from Amazon.com and before I knew it I had bought a copy. Martin's writing style, in respect to different chapters, was very interesting. He titled a chapter as the name of a key character and then the subsequent pages would be some unfolding of the story from that character's perspective. This kept the story fresh at all times; ever-changing. I will warn you that if you are a reader who likes to see each character to whom you become attached remain unharmed, this may not be the series for you. Martin dares to allow the big name(s) to die. Not all authors will take this step, I like it. It makes you realize that at any time, any one of the characters in the story could be killed. Not that this book needed help creating excitement, but this element certainly added to it. In true Sci-fi/Fantasy style, A Game of Thrones was a long book (Book 2, A Clash of Kings is even longer). When I would normally expect relief at the end of such a long book (807 pages), here I found actual goosebumps and the burning desire to continue the series. I applaud the author for his writing; his mix of sci-fi/fantasy with mystery and romance and everything in between, I thank Thomas for his recommendation which I pass on to you, and I order my copy of Book 2.","2005-10-07","United States","","true","69","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VV1UIUZWFIZ1"
"B000QCS8TW","5","The Best Fantasy Ever Written","This book is not the prototypical fantasy novel, but it is the best. It has in heaps and droves what many lack: verisimilitude. There are paragons of virtue, but they are not immune to the plotting of the wicked. There are villains as foul as any laid down in any fiction, but many express virtues when least expected. You see many sides to the story, and see many viewpoints. You could easily sympathize with the villains, so human are their motivations. In grand style and sweeping vision comes A Game of Thrones, the first book of A Song of Ice and Fire. If you have ever read fantasy, this is the book against which all others will be measured. If you have not, then this is the book which will shatter the genre barrier. The story is riveting, the characters are complex and captivating. There is so much nobility, treachery, deceit, murder, and foreboding that it threatens to overwhelm, but that is the rollercoaster ride that Martin puts you on. By the end, you are virtually guaranteed to laugh, cry, and want to reach into the pages and strangle some of the characters, both good and evil, for the foolish mistakes they make or the wicked deeds they commit. This book is truly a once in a lifetime master work, not to be missed. The backdrop is a medieval setting that feels more historical than fantastic. Martin leaves powerful wizards and ancient magic orders to other novelists, and in its place gives you a realistic world that is at once both incredibly broad and amazingly detailed. But it is the characters that will have you wanting for more when the last page is turned, characters at once both noble and flawed, wise and foolish, evil but principled; never has a book characterized so many fascinating characters that all seemed so tangible. This book is a paragon of both art and artifice. It is well-written, to be sure: vividly imagined and artfully set to the page. Martin is a master of prose, and his style effortlessly flows from description to dialogue to flashback without ever wandering or wasting pages. But truly, it is the artifice that will capture you. There are so many plots and stories swirling about in this soup that it threatens to overwhelm the reader, but Martin steers you through adeptly, showing you many points of view, until both the characters and the story have truly come to life, which makes every victory and tragedy the characters experience your own to feel. You are forewarned: if you read this book, you will be swept away, and you will scarcely be able to put it down, nor any of its sequels, until you have devoured every morsel of this tasty literary meal.","2005-06-06","United States","","true","70","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFEBWG71SE3CS"
"B000QCS8TW","5","My life is ruled by a dwarf, a bastard, and a cripple","Not sure how many ways I can idolize a book or a series. Following a horrific car crash, I now have a lot of problems reading for more than 5 or 10 minutes at a sitting. It took me 6 months to finish the GOT series (instead of maybe 6 weeks in the past). In that 6 months I read nothing else. Perfect books draw you into the story until the characters become real and part of your friends. After you quit the book, you grieve because you no longer spend time with your friends. This is that type of book. Perfect books have complex characters. Assuming that ""Avatar"" is the epitome of one-dimensional characterization, I can assure you that GOT is pretty much diametrically opposite to this practice. I love a character. I hate the character. I am ambivalent towards the character. Even tho I'm ambivalent I can't wait to see what happens to them. Good characters are bad; and bad are good. Convention is never drawn. If I were to nitpick? On Kindle, you can't read the blasted maps. Characters carouse, march, and muster all through a new world and you are pretty much clueless as to if it is a far cry or a short hop. Imagine reading LOR and not knowing where Bilbo is or where he is going. Also, GRRM writes the books in sequential chapters that follow different characters. All chapters end on a bit of a cliffhanger. You will then need to read 2-20 chapters to pick up the thread. Consequently, I read the books out of order. I followed the character throughout (skipping chapters merrily) until I came to the end of their story and then read the next chapter, picked up the next character, and then read only their story. I do NOT recommend this practice and hope to hell you have more self-control than I did and eschew this filthy habit. Read it in order. Makes much more sense that way. Have recommended this series only to people who love reading, as not everyone will commit to multi-thousand page sagas.","2012-07-14","United States","","true","71","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KTX4BF0FLO3S"
"B000QCS8TW","5","A Saga's Epic Start","A Game of Thrones is the excellent first installment in George R.R. Martin's epic A Song of Ice And Fire series. It introduces the continent of Westeros, where the fifteen year peace between seven kingdoms under King Robert Baratheon is growing tenuous. Add to this the stirring of malevolent supernatural forces in the wilds of the north, the reappearance of the exiled bloodline of the Mad King whom King Robert overthrew to gain control of the continent, and an impending winter as long and brutal as an ice age, and it's easy to understand how Martin's tale ballooned from a trilogy to an expected seven volumes. Martin sews this expansive tapestry with eight narrative threads. Six belong to the House of Stark from the northern most kingdom of Winterfell. The Starks find themselves in the center of the quickly escalating tensions in Westeros and are torn apart by duty, betrayal, and fate. Daenerys, the end of the usurped Mad King's bloodline, is wed to the leader of a nomadic people, the Dothraki in a misbegotten attempt by her brother to raise an army to take back the crown, and struggles to persevere amongst these brutal tribes in a land a sea away from Westeros. Meanwhile, Tyrion Lannister the dwarf brother of the nefarious Cersie, who is married to King Robert, slowly rises from black sheep to a central player in the Lannister power grab. While Martin's story is certainly complicated, it's told with a style and structure that beguiles and delights, always drawing the reader further in with fast pacing and clean prose. Comparisons to J.R.R. Tolkien are not unfounded. But while Martin's world certainly competes with Middle Earth as a fabulously detailed, astoundingly elaborate, carefully constructed fantasy realm, Tolkien's hobbits and dwarves are crude sketches compared to the nuanced, gray shading that goes into Martin's characters. The cast of Martin's saga possess rich inner lives with motivations too human to make most characters simply good or evil. It's the mix of complex characters and a grittily realistic fantasy realm that make Martin's saga so unforgettable and unpredictable. A Game of Thrones is as close as fiction gets to being a completely rapturous experience and, upon completing the final chapter, it is a tremendous thrill to know it is only end of the beginning.","2011-09-16","United States","","true","72","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVTDAKA2SXEDW"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Best Adult Fantasy Series Ever.","I have scanned some of the negative reviews of this book and it seems the common thread is shock over the adult content of the writing. Either that or outrage over the lack of a ""fantasy"" element. It should be known that this book and this series is not G-rated Tolkien. Nor is this series a rambling fantasy epic where everyone has special powers a' la Jordan. What this book and subsequent series happens to be is some of the best writing in the fantasy genre I have ever read. I have been reading fantasy for over 2 decades now and have never become so engrossed in any series as I have this one. True, I was a little put off at first by the lack of the ""fantasy"" element - I didn't expect a historically based fiction novel to hold my attention - but it did, and the further on in the series you go, the more ""fantasy"" comes into play. I read the Jordan series up until Winter's Heart and enjoyed the first 6 books or so but eventually realized that the story was going nowhere. After reading Game of Thrones and the subsequent novels I finally grasped what good writing actually is. There are no cliche' characters in ASOIAF and no hokey actions like Nynaeve ""pulling her braid"" in anger. Every major character is fully fleshed out and quite believable. The actions and reactions that lead to conflict are intelligent and understandable. The ""adult"" content is not over-the-top and only adds to the immersion and believability of the world that Martin created. Admittedly, the series starts out a little slowly with this book but keep on reading and you will be glad you did. The plot twists Martin throws out are sometimes saddening and sometimes uplifting but when you finish a book you feel as if you lived it. This is by no means a feel good fantasy series where the good guy always wins and no one gets hurt. This is a novel that describes what a medevil world must really be like if thrown into conflict with unknown forces as well as other Houses. I could go on and on about how well written and engaging this series is but you will just have to learn for yourself. If you are looking for a fantasy series that will keep you yearning for the next book and if you really want to see what quality writing is like, I recommend starting with A Game of Thrones.","2007-02-10","United States","","true","73","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PBAA571YDQZ0"

"B000QCS8TW","5","Dark and complex epic fantasy","This is an awesome book, an inspiration in the genre. It's powerful, complex, compelling, intelligent, and a solid read. In short, it's one of the best fantasy books you can buy. What's good about it? It introduces a very interesting and unique sort of plot that breaks convention, the morality is complex and ambiguous, the prose and mechanics of the writing are top notch, the style was gripping and sometimes humorous, dialogue is top of the line, the characters were very three-dimensional, and the sheer complexity of the work alone is an interesting element. Lastly, I liked the vast number of POV characters that the author introduced, rather than simply one. George Martin did a good job at showing the different viewpoints from different people and giving them all their own unique voice. Be ready to concentrate and remember while you read, though, because you'll need to keep track of a lot of different characters, not to mention the backstory, worldbuilding, and minor characters. The outline of the great houses at the back of the book is helpful for this. The pacing of the story wasn't extraordinary, but still good. If anything bothered me, it was the rather slow movement of the story. Though not bad, it would have benefitted by having things happen faster and having a little less detail. As it is, I think the author is enjoying himself too much as he writes the interaction between the characters, and wants to do it as much as possible. I also a minor quibble that Bran was a bit bland and lifeless, so his chapters seemed like a bit of a waste. A few words of warning: If you like your heroes and want them to live, this book may not be for you. There are enough characters that any of them might come out on top in the end, and Martin doesn't seem to think his books complete unless he kills at least two of them in each novel. There is also quite a bit of violence, language, and sexuality in this book. Though not quite as graphic or nasty as Terry Goodkind's series, it might turn off some readers, especially more sensitive ones. In conclusion, it's hard to go wrong with this book, which is currently one of the best in the genre. It's probably the best in the series, too, considering the direction the sequels go.","2009-04-24","United States","","true","75","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RII87VY8JN7NV"
"B000QCS8TW","5","All I can say is... Wow!","You must read this book. From the fast paced prologue, Game of Thrones, opens up into a diverse and amazing story of action, romance, politics and betrayal. Game of Thrones has a unique style to it. The story is not linear at all but rather the story is seen through the eyes of many different characters. Each with his/her own personality, trials and triumphs. Martin brings you into each one of these character's lives but only as you read further on do you really begin to know them truly. At times it can get confusing though, for each of these main characters also has his/her own story and people in their life that might not carry on from character to character. Others fill in through out the other characters. Needless to say, there is a lot going on so watch out. I had to go back and reread certain chapters to clarify what is happening. It is detail rich! With that said, look at a map. Westeros is a big world with lots of cities and lands and people. I do want to warn the future reader that this book contains a lot of adult situations. There is a lot of sex, references to it and detailed scenes as well as language. I did not want to take off a star for this because it is actually very well placed and not over done. I would even say it needs to be there for the story and characters to develop. If you are bothered by this then maybe this book would not be for you. If you can over look it, then this book will be worth every second spent reading it. *Edit 8/17/12* Well, I am almost done with he series now (just about to start the fifth book) and if I were to describe it in one word it would be committed. Game of Thrones is the toughest series I have ever read. At times (after book three) I was bored, I'll be honest, but other times I could not turn the pages fast enough.

Another aspect of the story I like is the grittiness of the characters. There doesn't seem to be a clearly defined good versus evil although there is a lot of talk about honor and doing one's duty. There are some truly evil characters that I loathe, and I eagerly look forward to them meeting justice for their despicable actions. The book hints at magic use, but only features it a couple times. There are some hints of what I would call mysticism with references to older times when magic abounded, and the ability to peer into the future/sense things going on in other parts of the realm. I also got the sense that there might be some magic left in the world, and it may come out more in later stories. As a word of warning, the book includes some graphic, violent scenes in the form of war, executions, and sword fighting.

I never Heard of George R.R. Martin before. I have heard people compare this series to tolkien's work and I agree it is as masterful but I find GRRM's writing much more interesting. I started reading this book on my Kindle blissfully unaware of how many actual pages there are in this novel, 858 by my kindles count. I am a fairly slow reader and I finished this book in a little over three weeks. I have never even read a non fiction work this long in my life. I could not put the book down. I became so enamoured with the characters that I didn't even notice how long it was. I found myself spending as much of my free time reading this as I could. I am astounded by the sheer complexity of the world GRRM has built and the characters within it. I thoroughly enjoy the way the narrative changes in each chapter. I am also watching the series on TV and it doesn't do the book justice. The book is so filled with vivid descriptions and internal thoughts of the characters that the series can only imply. I am already reading A Clash of Kings. I started yesterday only 12 hours after I finished Game of Thrones. Some people may not like the narrative switching but I think it adds depth and complexity to the characters and to the overall story. I will be buying and reading the entire series and when I am done with that I will be seeking out other books written by George R.R Martin. This is the first novel I have read in a long time that had such interesting characters. Like another review said the characters aren't the black and white, good and bad medieval characters of normal fantasy novels. They are like real people, a mix of all that is good and bad, intelligent and ignorant and sometimes all at the same time. The story itself is full of little twists and turns and things don't happen as expected in most circumstances yet for me the story is very enjoyable.","2011-06-02","United States","","true","78","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RME39TNC5UL4T"

"B000QCS8TW","4","Highly recommended book","I highly recommend the book game of thrones a song of ice and Fire. because it tells the story of a battle for the throne, it's complex nature and multiple plot lines has turned it into one of my favorite books. This is also because Game of Thrones is based off of a real event in the United Kingdom called the battles of the Roses. Visit Ted-Ed to learn more about these battles. Game of thrones a song of ice and fire is the first book of the series written by George R. R. Martin. The beginning of the Game of Thrones a song of Ice and Fire starts with a prologue foreshadowing a major problem in the future, white walkers. They are mystic beings north of the border of Westerose and wilding territory, this border is called the wall, and is quite literally a 750 foot tall wall of ice. But the actual plot starts with Eddard Stark, also known as Ned, his children Rob, Sansa, Arya, Bran, Rickon, and Jon Snow, Ned’s bastard son. Ned Stark is considered the most honorable man in the seven kingdoms, as well as the free cities. Both of these continents make up Westerose, the land which the man in the iron throne rules. Ned Stark is a the lord of Winterfell and head of the Stark family. This is only one of the many plot lines, every chapter starts at a different person's point of view with no apparent main character. These characters are often killed or no longer have a story arc showing no one is safe, this is one of the reason Game of Thrones is my favorite series as well as the books, it is unpredictable. No one is safe and the books are constantly introducing new concepts and characters.","2017-09-06","United States","","true","80","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XZ69E5GNE7DG"
"B000QCS8TW","1","Just say no","Had I written a review of Game of Thrones after reading the first book, it would be a solid 5 star review. Perhaps after the second in the series it would be the same, but after the third I could in honesty only have rated it a 3 or 4. However, after the 4th in this series I can only conclude that Mr. Martin is both a gifted writer of fiction as well as an author whose work should be ignored. To begin with, while the author writes well, he must be paid by the word since these novels are absolutely interminable in length. If you plan on being marooned for a few years on an island, or go to prison to do a nickel, just take this series with you. You'll still not finish. Second, the interesting alternating point of view between characters in the first three books metastasizes in the fourth with the addition of scores of new characters and their points of view while the points of view of other interesting characters developed in the first three suddenly disappear. Cases in point - Tyrion, the dwarf brother of the evil Jaime, is one of the most interesting characters in the first three volumes, yet he inexplicably disappears in the fourth. The second most interesting character in the volumes 1 - 3, Jon Snow, the bastard son of Eddard Stark, also makes no appearance in volume 4. Same with the third most interesting character, Danerys. Putting down volume 3, you really want to know what happens to her next. Fuggetaboutit. She's gone from volume 4. Imagine the Lord of Rings, where each volume is 3 times longer and Frodo Baggins makes no appearance in the third volume. Additionally, Mr. Martin likes to kill off his most important characters, or render them suddenly blind, or convert them from being evil to nice. Again, imagine Lord of the Rings, where Aragorn chokes to death on a mouthful of ale in the Two Towers, or Sauron turns out to be really a nice guy who's just irritated because a turkey buzzard flew into and got stuck in his big red eye. I guess my advice is to plow through these if you really don't mind being bitch slapped by an author. The writing is excellent and the world created intriguing. However, the story goes nowhere, and gets to nowhere via thousands of pages, all the while inserting and removing and altering characters at will. I gather that many are waiting for the grand finale in volume 6 that Martin has promised. If there is a God in heaven, we shall be spared. But if after this warning you still proceed on this irritating quest, do what I did. When you finally figure out that you are being punked by the author, ignore the sequence of the chapters. Just start with a character point of view and read each one for that character sequentially. There is a bare semblance of a plot anyway, so Lord knows, you won't spoil anything by reading ahead for a particular character since nothing happens anyway. When you get to volume 4, ignore all the randomly introduced new characters who add nothing to the story developed in the first three. This way, you can impose some small amount of coherence on an otherwise completely incoherent story structure, and trust me, you won't lose anything in the process, mostly because there is nothing to lose in the first place.","2012-03-15","United States","","true","81","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZBQCTPAK8KCS"

"B000QCS8TW","5","Fantastically realistic world","I've never been a great fan of fantasy books, but this one is absolutely brilliant. These are real people in a not that fantastic world. In this book there are no heroes, no villains. Everything is relative to the View point character. Every chapter is told by the character's point of view, with the character's knowledge and the character reactions to every event in this amazing story. You don't have the typical fantasy character archetypes, but more realistic characters that are not trying to defeat evil, they are all trying to get their way for their own interests or ideals. Loved the fact that the main characters are not ""the brave and good looking knight"" and the ruthless ugly villain. Tyrion the dwarf, Arya the boyish girl and Daenyares the feminist leader are great alternatives to the typical type of characters. Honor and good is not rewarded as one would expect in this kind of books, selfish and greedy characters usually get their way with things. There is magic in this world, but it is not the most important thing. Dragons and creatures are part of the world, not as magical creatures but real animals that live or lived there. Magic is as real as in our world, with people that believe in it and people that are more skeptic. There is a lot of exposition of an amazing back story with a lot of mysteries and legends that makes you want to know more and more about it and how this has impacted in the current world and the characters of the story. Its a long book, some times the pace of the story is slower that you would like, but it's really enjoyable to read the different view point characters reactions to the events. I recommend this book to people that wants to read a great political, social medieval conflict with a touch of fantasy on it, if you are disposed to read the 800 pages long this book is.","2014-03-12","United States","","true","83","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20X60NIQN6VCR"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Incredible Book","Pros: + A well rounded, complex set of characters. + Feels different from your standard fantasy fare. + Fluid, descriptive writing style. + Gritty, realistic, etc. Cons: - The book becomes less interesting as the characters separate from one another. - Moves the story (or stories) along very little for an 800 page book. Set in the shockingly complex and realistic kingdom of Westeros, this book follows the conflicts of a dizzying array of people and houses. This has got to be the best fantasy novel that I have read in a good long time. This book is not typical of the genre. Gone are the clear distinctions between good and evil and you won't spend the whole book waiting for the sections with that interesting grey character because every character is grey. It is possible to sympathize with each of the nine point of view characters, but each of them also have very obvious flaws and quirks which are heightened by them being viewed through the lens of the others. The book largely deals with the conflicts and political jockeying of great houses and it has a quite a realistic feel to it. There are a few fantasy creatures such as direwolves, but in general, you get the impression that magic is something that existed in the past and may in fact exist in the present, but it is hard to pin down how to use it or when it is being used. Most of the more fantastic elements remain on the periphery of the story. The length of the book helps Martin introduce the world and characters to a huge extent. Some readers, however, may find Martin's slow story development off putting. Also, the story reaches its most interesting points when these marvelously developed characters interact with one another, but as the story goes on, they become separated and this happens less and less often. Daenerys is separated from the other point of view characters entirely. Overall, though, this is a marvelous book with few flaws. The political machinations that pit Stark against Lannister are both fascinating and personal. You will likely find yourself loving two characters that are constantly played against one another, making reading this book a nuanced and thought provoking experience.","2007-11-14","United States","","true","84","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKNQ2FRO537PO"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Amazing & Unpredictable Medieval Fantasy","OK, so there are well over a thousand reviews here, most 5 stars, so many are so detailed that I'll just try to be brief. The book is amazing. A medieval fantasy told from multiple view points by characters who are extremely well developed and filled with realistic human foibles. No one is perfect, no one is always right, and the good guys don't always come out on top. The characters are so incredibly written, and yet you soon realize that they are simply the medium through which this story is being told, and it is the STORY that is the main character. Don't get too attached to anyone, 'cause you never know what might happen. This book (bk 1) takes place in a medieval world that used to have magic and mythical creatures in it, but no longer does. However, what you begin to see as the series continues, is that the magic is beginning to return and what it brings with it. The plot and subplots are filled with intrigue. The characters are calculating and manipulative. Every time you finish reading about one character, you just wish you could skip ahead and see what happens to them, but then you start the next section and you want to keep going with that one instead! This is no cookie cutter fantasy book. It is NOT predictable. I'm so glad I found it late in the series, because I love reading a series with back to back books and I would have dreaded waiting three years between books! The latest book (A Dance with Dragons) is due out July 12, 2011. An amazing series, even if you don't consider yourself a fan of fantasy!

"B000QCS8TW","4","A Brilliant Read","** spoiler alert ** I thoroughly enjoyed the first installment of this series by George R.R. Martin. The sophisticated marriage of sci-fi, fantasy and historical genres was well-done. I will say that I did myself a disservice by watching the HBO series before reading this book. While the book was fantastic and entertaining, after about 400 pages I was a bit bored since I already knew what was going to happen. On the other hand, without the foundation of the TV series, I probably would've been a bit puzzled with so many story lines being tied together. I can see that all of the story lines and different perspectives may be problematic for me as I read the next books. Too much bouncing around. However, if not too many new character's perspectives are introduced, I'll probably survive the next book. ""When people play the game of thrones, you win or you die."" --> If only poor Ned had understood this! It made me a bit upset that his pride and excruciatingly high sense of morale caused him to lose the ""game."" Alas, the old saying goes that ""nice guys always finishes last,"" or in this case, dead. Martin certainly proved the previous aphorism to be correct. I applaud the author's bravery in killing off central characters regardless of the reader's connection to them. The imagery that Martin is able to express via carefully chosen descriptions is applaudable. I love the world(s) that he creates and his ability to *not overdo it*. Just enough fantasy and mythical elements to pique interest, rife with mentally unstable despots, a heavy dose of brutality and sexuality, with a smattering of romance, all shrouded in an almost familiar historical context. Kudos. The world presented in GoT is believable. The characters are guaranteed to evoke some type of reaction from the reader - whether it be adoration, love or pure hatred. And the interwoven stories leave you wanting more. If only the page count was under 600, ah well.","2013-02-22","United States","","true","86","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R179FQYHE9BOC8"
"B000QCS8TW","5","Fantastic","I've read almost two books of the set so far and every one of them is absolutely brilliant. You can call it fantasy for grown ups, where gruesome reality of war and complexity of human nature is tightly interwoven with events highly reminiscent of ones in actual French and English history, interspersed with magic and lore. It's not some low-brow fantasy cliche adventure with corny heroes and fair maidens with giant knockers (no offense to low-brow fantasy, you have your time and place in the absence of better writing) -this is a real work of art that is done intelligently, with great love and compassion for human condition and descriptions that will either make you absolutely entranced with their beauty, or force you to shudder at their brutal honesty. He's got the best style of writing I've seen in decades, I'm finishing the second book now (A Clash of Kings) and I cannot put it down till wee hours of the morning. I can't think of anyone who has a better, richer, more gripping writing style than G.R.R. Martin these days, and can't believe that I didn't pick these books up until now. I have not seen the show yet besides getting a few glimpses here and there, but judging by how fast they are forced to move through events to fit into the series' timeframe, I see that they are glazing over huge chunks of the backstory which is not only important further in the books, but also contains all the intrigue, mystery, character development and interactions you don't want to miss, so I really recommend reading the books even if you already follow the series-there is so much more that would never fit into any possible screen format.

"B000QCS8TW","5","I hate formulaic fantasy crap. I LOVE Game of Thrones!","Ok, I was really skeptical about this series. Sure, sure, my dopey geek fantasy role playing friends couldn't stop praising it, making me want to read it even less. Then I saw HBO was doing it as a series, AND the Fantasy Flight card game was getting huge reviews and I figured I'd better give it a second look. At first I was put off by the ""Ser this and that"" and the ""heraldic"" prose, but after a few chapters I got to know the characters and I must say I was BLOWN AWAY. This darned Martin dude can really turn a phrase. The world he has created is fully formed, and the characters are 3 dimensional (well, the main characters, anyway. He gives names to thousands of bit players who could get by with just a description like ""a courtier entered the room"" instead of ""Frogbottom Leafhelm entered the room"". Once you get used to this style, however, it does add to the ambience but it can be confusing who you're supposed to be paying attention to.) Anyway, this story takes some great and unexpected turns, and Martin uses some very advanced techniques to move the story forward quickly. I liked this series so much I bought it for my best friend's kindle account because he's too lazy to download it himself but I think he'll enjoy it if I hand it to him on a silver platter. I love this book, and the series, and I've grown to basically hate the fantasy genre over the last few years because I've gotten burned buying stuff that looked interesting but stunk up the room. Songs of Fire and Ice: Game of Thrones is a very notable and welcome exception to the loads of excrement that call themselves ""Fantasy Novels"" out there today (oh, don't go all ballistic on me...I know there's some good stuff still out there, I'm just being hyperbolic for effect. :-)) your pal, Lobsta PS: If you like this, do check out the Fantasy Flight card game, also sold by Amazon.com.

"B000QCS8TW","5","Intriguing, fun read","1) fast shipping 2) perfect condition 3) Excellent story line as thick and colorful as a soap opera. I started reading Game of Thrones after I saw the HBO series and fell in love with the dynamic characters. Martin's female characters are all strong and sometimes cruel and wicked. It's not very often fantasy novels (or any novel for that matter) has a wide array of strong, female leads. If you are coming to this book after seeing the series like I did, know that it follows season 1 of the Game of Thrones exactly. Or I should say HBO follows Martin's first novel in the series exactly - practically word for word, scene for scene. This has a dual effect. a) the book seems boring as there are no surprises after watching the TV show, however, b) as a fan, it's wonderful to see Hollywood (or HBO in this case) to honor a book for the masterpiece that it is and to not glamorize or bastardize it. Any fan of the book would be excited to see the small screen bring their characters to life in such. Isn't that one of the biggest complaints readers have? We get excited to see how are heroes on the page are brought to life, but are usually disappointed - at least I am (examples: X-men, World War z, etc.) So, if you are picking up the book after seeing the series, there will be no surprises. (though apparently Martin cannot find another simile for red other than blood nor can he not mention ""winter is coming"" for longer than 20 pages. Sigh. give it a break, Martin! I heard you the first hundred times) If you are reading this book without having been acquainted to the TV series then be prepared for hundreds of characters, fast moving plot lines, witty characters, megalomania, and political corruption and deception.

"B000QCS8TW","4","Well-drawn characters, much blood, gore, and death","George R.R. Martin knows how to get into the heads of his characters and convey who they are to his readers. In this novel, the chapters shift points of view among eight different characters, creating insight and empathy for each. Some of these characters are each other's enemies, many are children, some are underdogs, and all are very human. GRRM leaves it up to the reader to decide who earns their admiration or distrust, fondness or dislike. The many other significant characters are reflected through the eyes of those eight and are not as readily judged -- at least, not until they act in a manner that displays their true selves. Their true selves can be horrid. While a book about noble families competing for power cannot be tame, I found the ever-present threat of death, and the gruesome ways in which death could come about, hard to read when I cared so much about most of the main characters. I like the way GRRM writes, giving enough detail to clearly picture scenes in my mind yet not so detailed that I want to skip paragraphs. I like the direwolves and dragons, and I fear the Others. But though the world he created is still on my mind (and not having seen the HBO series), I do not want the next book or the one after to show me my favorite characters dying horribly or otherwise being mentally or physically tortured.

"B000QCS8TW","5","You Either Win, Or You Die","Never has a more fundamentally correct statement been made of a series of books. This, the first book in the so far five book series, is mostly context. You learn about the world that is about to get thrown into chaos (and when I say chaos, I mean total, unadulterated, s*** storm chaos). You learn about everything and everyone that your soon to be beloved protagonists/antagonists (because you'll love them both) have loved and lost, and you'll feel genuine pain when they do. No book or series of books has been able to elicit such emotions from I, because I am a emotionless demon, black of heart. But Game of Thrones does what nothing else in this world can do. Make me ""feel"" things. I initially started watching the TV series back in season 1. At the end of episode six, I felt as if my mind had been not only raped, but pleasantly raped at that. Do you understand? No. Neither did I. But I couldn't help but want more, and so I turned to these books. By the time episode seven aired on TV, I had finished the book. I knew exactly what was coming, exactly who was to live and who was to die, but it didn't matter. I was still invested in every way. I read through the other three books in a matter of weeks, and then had to wait two or three months for book five to be published--the longest wait through which I have ever suffered. But it was worth it. If you haven't started A Game of Thrones, if you haven't watched the show or read the books, then start now. Buy this. It's amazeballs.

"B000QCS8TW","5","Epic and Tragic","I heard about A Game of Thrones like many people that have recently read the book, from the HBO series. A bit of warning to new readers. The author pushes you right into the deep end from the start. People or places or events mentioned may not be brought back up or explained until later in the book. There are A LOT of characters and it is easy to get you houses and family members mixed up. With that being said if you can make through the first 100 pages you will be set for the rest of the book. The main storyline is set a few decades after a bloody rebellion in which the rebels defeated House Targaryen (the current ruling house) and set a new king on the throne. You follow the story of 4 Houses, House Stark, House Lannister, House Baratheon, and the remnants of House Targaryen. Character development is some of the best I have ever read. Most of the characters are not only changed from the beginning to the end of the novel, they have been drastically changed from the events. Fight scenes were executed marvelously and the action was pretty much nonstop for the majority of the book. Moral choices for the characters pop up at every turn and at times you even question yourself at what you think is right. A Game of Thrones is one of the few novels I have read that really got me emotionally involved with the story. I really care for the characters and felt genuine remorse (and excitement in some cases) for the death of characters who did not make it. This novel is not for the faint of heart as there is a lot of adult content, such as sex, rape, murder, war, and so on. After putting down this book I have started right into A Clash of Kings as I could not wait to continue this grand adventure.","2012-05-21","United States","","true","93","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P0U9A54QW22N"

But as it came so highly recommended from my middle son and so many of his friends, how could I not! I am eternally grateful to them for being so insistent! The characters have true character and depth. You love them, you hate them; you laugh with them, you cry with them; you cry for them. It is a roller coaster of emotion and adventure. The story line is truly gripping and I can honestly say that once you start, you can't stop and there are 5 books all up (so far). The 4th book was about to be published when I started reading this series for the first time. Now that book #5 has been released I am starting from the beginning again (good excuse) so I can remember it all (as there is so much happening) and relive every moment so as to truly appreciate this next book. For those of you that are not into fantasy, you should still give it a try as I found it to be more like a setting in Medieval times and certainly not 'over the top' fantasy. It mainly follows the Stark's of Winterfell, who's kingdom is surrounded by a protective wall, which is manned by the Night's Watch, keeping them safe from the wildlings and the Others. But to the vast frozen north, something supernatural and sinister is brewing and has to be stopped before it breeches their security. Thus begins the epic adventure full of mystery, intrigue, love, loss, tragedy, victory, assassins and betrayal. This is an epic masterpiece. So beautifully written with believable characters and plots of such wonderful depth. I highly recommend this book, and all the books in this series, to everyone; whether you are a fantasy lover or not. I doubt very much that you'd be disappointed!

"B000QCS8TW","4","Not your typical fantasy","A Game of Thrones is basically review-proof; the series already has a large fanbase that continues to grow due to the HBO series. This is a more ""realistic"" fantasy, set in a world not unlike medieval Europe; magical creatures are largely considered myths or extinct. With the more grounded world-building also comes the more unpleasant aspects of the society; there are depictions of brutal battles, torture, executions, incest, and rape. The story follows the Stark family, feudal lords of the northernmost part of the realm. Patriarch Eddard Stark is tapped by the current king to serve as the ""hand,"" in essence taking care of the day to day aspects of governing the realm. While at court, Eddard soon discovers a conspiracy that may have been orchestrated by the power-hungry Lannister family. Meanwhile, Daenerys, the last princess of the recently deposed Targaryen dynasty, finds herself in an arranged marriage overseas to a powerful nomadic leader as her brother schemes to take back the throne for himself. In many ways this a subversion of most fantasy stories; a heroic major character fails in his task partly due to his or her own trusting nature. A young girl's dreams of being a princess are shattered by a harsh reality where she is faced instead with a cruel, brutal prince. The story ends with multiple factions preparing for war amongst themselves, unaware of a possibly worse supernatural threat. Although the story may seem bleak at times, there's a lot of intriguing stuff that make me want to keep reading. A massive wall of ice exists to keep unknown threats out of the realm, which includes a supernatural force of animated corpses. There are some pretty memorable characters, such as snarky dwarf (a human, not the fairy0tale kind) Tyrion, and Eddard's rebellious daughter, Arya. Martin's world-building is also top-notch, and definitely succeeds at creating a believable universe for these characters. I will definitely be reading the next book.","2013-08-10","United States","","true","96","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PCHDVXMS7ZNF"
"B000QCS8TW","3","Shame on me for reading the whole thing","Before I launch into the reasons I will not be reading the rest of the series, let me say that I believe George R.R. Martin to be a masterful storyteller. This is the only book of his that I have read as yet, however. Martin weaves a tale so gripping you feel that you are a character in the story. And he fashions characters as real as any person you actually know. The twists and turns hook you and keep you wanting more. Unfortunately, I will not be reading on to find out what becomes of the characters I have grown to admire, despise or pity. I cannot stomach one more description of the rape, degredation or denigration of the female characters in Martin's writing. The word ""whore"" is used too many times to count. Yes, yes, we get it: the men in this world saw lowborn women as nothing more than servants or sluts to satisfy their needs. Only women who are lucky enough to marry into the right family are treated with any kind of respect- respect that vanishes instantly with the precarious positions of power their husbands hold. Martin, however, beats the point to death. Even more disturbing is the graphic description of women being raped/sodomized or gang-raped several times in the story. One mention (in less detail)of this vile practice among the Dothraki people would have sufficed, but I guess the author felt it necessary to creep us out with many more. And the description of the seduction of a 13 year-old Daenerys, by a grown man, left me feeling dirty and guilty for reading on. Yes, they married young in this world, we get it. As if that was not bad enough, of the main female characters, there is only one that I could admire: Arya, the nine year-old daughter of Eddard Stark. She is the only character who was intelligent as well as strong and independent minded. Alas, Martin seems to imply that beauty is incompatible with brains and virtue by describing her as ""horse-faced"" by other characters. The others may have beauty, but lack virtue or are foolish and weak, because of their womanly passions. Cersei Lannister, the queen, is lovely but a cold-blooded, cunning witch. Sansa, the twelve year old daughter of Eddard Stark, is pretty, sickenly well-bred, but lacking in sense and loyalty. Daenerys is abused and brainwashed in turn by her brother, then Dothraki culture. Catelyn Stark, Eddard's wife, also beautiful but tragically selfish to her family's ruin. Lysa Arryn, Catelyn's sister, is portrayed as half-mad and revoltingly doting over her sickly son. Women servants and common peasants are repeatedly, and so contemptuously described that it makes you want to scream, ""Yeah, we got that a long time ago: women are sluts and only fit to do a man's bidding. can we move on already!?"" This is in contrast to the male characters who also have flaws, but are basically excused by their life experiences and particular upbringing. We can find many males to empathize with and/or admire: the honorable, but too trusting Eddard Stark; his resolute and skilled bastard son, Jon Snow; young Robb Stark, brave and thoughtful; the staunch and loyal men in the Tully family and other families pledged to the Starks; the loyal and valiant knights and men of the Kingsguard; even Khal Drogo of the bloodthirsty Dothrakis and the scheming Imp, Tyrion Lannister. I hope to find another author in this genre, or even another book by Martin that does not offend the whole female gender the way this book did.","2011-12-27","United States","","true","97","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DHRWW26KZSKV"
"B000QCS8TW","5","An Excellently Crafted World, With Compelling Characters","This is certainly one of the longest books I have ever read in my life, but the world that is crafted here takes a book this long to setup. George R.R. Martin has done a wonderful job of crafting a world of the seven kingdoms that highlights the political struggles and self motivations of seven ruling families. If you are a fan of the fantasy genre then there is a lot to like here, but take note that I would not actually consider this to be hard fantasy. While it does have knights and kings in it, there is no magic or fantastical beasts, at least not in any significant capacity. I have heard a lot of people compare this book and series to the Lord of the Rings. I think that comparison is apt only in relation to the scope of the world that this story takes place in, not in the way it is made. As is to be assumed with almost any book of this size the biggest drawback to it is the amount of information that is required by the reader. Very early on in the book you will find yourself overwhelmed with the amount of people you are expected to keep straight. On the whole though, once the characters are known the story itself progresses in a very forward fashion. The chapters are broken up nicely by the story progression of the individual characters and there were very few times that I ever felt that the story progression dragged on. Character development is very well done and I grew to love and hate characters in the book. What was great about most of the hated characters though is that none of them were truly evil. Everyone executed their actions due to various motivations which made not only their stories more interesting, but more human. Overall this is incredibly well crafted with one of the most interesting worlds I have read in fantasy in quite a long time. Don't be frightened by the length.","2011-03-06","United States","","true","98","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XVBHN136NCNY"
"B000QCS8TW","5","A compelling page-turner that matches up almost scene-for-scene to the HBO series","As a fan of the HBO series, I was curious to find out how closely the writers of the TV show had adhered to the original text, and I was eager to delve more deeply into the minds and backstories of my favorite characters. There's mostly good news: it turns out that HBO was almost eerily faithful to the plot of the books (at least judging from this first novel). You can easily picture the scenes from the TV show playing out in your head in tandem with the words on the page. The only real difference is the ages of the characters...but then again, it would be hard to create a palatable TV show featuring sex scenes between teen girls and grown men (for instance, in the book Dany is 14 on her wedding night). The only (debatable) drawback: If you've seen the TV series, you'll find that the novel offers very little additional information/detail. But is that a criticism of the book, or praise for the show? I'm conflicted. While I would like to have been privy to brand new revelations and additional character motivation etc., I'm simultaneously impressed at how faithfully and thoroughly HBO has transferred the mythology and history of this complex literary world to a media format that traditionally requires ditching all but the most vital elements of character and plot. The bottom line: if you love the show, you'll enjoy revisiting the lives of your favorite characters. The plotting is fast-paced and satisfying. Martin is an excellent writer, and he created a truly compelling page-turner that never drags or disappoints. I'm looking forward to book two.","2018-01-11","United States","","true","99","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GEFVX59VIZ1Y"
