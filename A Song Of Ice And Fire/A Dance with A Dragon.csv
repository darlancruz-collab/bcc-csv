"B003YL4LYI","5","imaginative, epic","I'm not sure anyone will read my review since it's coming in after something like 850 entries, but just in case, I wanted to put my two cents in because all the almost hysterical anti-DWD rants may actually discourage people from buying the book, and I think that would be a mistake. Here's my take on way people are so enraged (***some general non-specific spoilers***) 1. They genuinely care about the book and want it to be the brilliant once-in-fifty-years fantasy it has promised to be. They are afraid it won't, particularly since GRRM has taken 10 years to produce Books 4 & 5 (which could really be one book). GRRM, like all of us, is mortal, so people are worried, God forbid, he will not have enough time to finish the books at all and/or he lacks the discipline and well power to do so. (By the way, anyone who tosses out bizarre insults about GRRM-he's lazy, he's arrogant, etc - I dismiss out of hand. If you have such little respect for him, don't read his stuff.) 2. BOoks 4 & 5 are 'middle' books, much as the second book in the LOTR trilogy was. GRRM deliberately decides to have his characters go in circles and for nothing to 'happen' - that is part of his point here. Such books are much easier to read when there is a Book 6 & 7 to read immediately, or when you are confident Books 6 & 7 will be on their way shortly. People are not confident of this. 3. The world of the pseudo Near East was poorly imagined, not as realistic as the Western Westeros. In particular, Dany's world was not fully fleshed out--it is entirely corrupt & despotic, with no positive traits. Yet the slave world of, say, Egypt, also had greatness--religion the arts, etc. This Western stereotype of an Egypt=like state made Dany's stay there very hard to bear because in addition to the one-dimensional world, Dany herself was behaving really really one-dimensionally. Spoiler ** QUESTION---Did anyone else pick up the possibility that Dany was being bespelled by the wizards and that was the reason she locked her dragons and lost her way? There are numerous hints in the book. 4. Finally, the books could have used editing. Indeed, with good editing, Books 4 & 5 could have been one book of about 800 pages max. Nearly all of the Brienne chapters of Book 4, for instance, could have been omitted. In this book, several Dany chapters could have been omitted with zero negative repercussions. Positives: So what's good about this book? The tone, scope and breadth of this book was outstanding. If you view this as a tale in which Westeros and the outside world are CHARACTERS themselves, the story becomes much more interesting. GRRM, I believe, is attempting to make this a story about a whole world rather than a mere story about Westeros. Because he decided to do this, he had to follow several story strands he didn't anticipate he would follow. This is also primarily a story about power---how to get it, how to lose it, what you do when you have it and what exactly it is. In this case, the story centers mostly on the 'how to use it,' with Jon and Dany really struggling. As with all great writers, GRRM takes story arcs and goes FAR past the predictable--Tyrion kills his father. But the story doesn't end at all. Dany frees the slaves. Then what? Jon gets power. Then what? Arya trains. But now what? Bran finds the Children of the Forest. Now what? What I find particularly great about the book is how GRRM refuses to categorize good or evil (with the exception of a truly evil person like the Bolton thing). Even with the Others it is not clear entirely what their purpose is, or what they are. Is the 'kind man' Arya trains with evil or good? Does it matter? Which of the religions are 'true'? All? None? Are they really one? These questions are examined in even more detail and depth in this book than in others. It is a 'dance' and the dance goes nowhere. That is part of the point. I may be wrong, but I think GRRM had the most difficulty writing these books, 4 & 5, because he didn't originally anticipate having to write them--they are mostly a bridge between 'here' and 'there,' both of which he seems to have mapped out. It's the bridge part he's had trouble with, figuring out just how to get the characters from here to there, and what the point of the journey was. I do think the next two books will come quicker and will have a lot more action now that all the chess pieces are in place. I would definitely recommend reading this, particularly if, like me, you know ahead of time that it's not extremely action packed (although it definitely has its moments). Worth your time.","2011-08-21","United States","","true","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RB3GKJOO8VXLZ"
"B003YL4LYI","5","Things to know before you read this Dance","This book is controversial now among fans. Some love it, some hate it. So I've decided to break down my review in a fashion that should be useful for someone who hasn't read it but is a fan of the series. I won't provide any major spoilers, but there will be some minor ones alluded to (hopefully very subtley.) I mainly want to talk about what I think is the best way to approach the book. In my opinion, some of the people who giving this novel one star are reacting to the fact that this is not the book they imagined. This is not to say that there aren't valid criticisms to be made and issues to discuss, but I feel that many who are vehemently upset are a bit blinded by what they perceive to be the arc of the story vs. how it is now trajecting. A lot of people had certain expectations about the direction of the plot, and Martin does what he always does - he subverts expectations. I feel as though many fans have fantasized / romanticized what this book was going to be like and instead of seeing what it is; they are only seeing how it is different from what they spent several years imagining it would be. Things they wanted to happen didn't. New and unexpected things did. The scope of the world increases even more, with new characters and new locations. If you come at this book from the point of view that the only part of the world you're interested in Westeros, then you aren't going to like Dance With Dragons. In my opinion, you're also going to miss out on some of the most compelling sections of the entire series. The thing that separates Song of Ice and Fire from other fantasy series is that the scope of the world - the sheer size and the depth of the history of it - is beyond tremendous. We've got HUNDREDS and HUNDREDS of characters both in the past and present, who are all brought to life. We've got not just one continent, but an entire world. It is a world that is constantly growing richer and richer. With each book the series expands. I've often found this to be the source of a lot of frustration for some readers throughout the series. For example, people got pissed off about the Iron Islands chapters in the second book, and bored with Dorne in the fourth. Honestly though, there is HUGE payoff for all of that in this novel. Now I can't imagine not having the Iron Islands in the story, and I'm grateful he took us there in the second book. My advice is twofold - read this book next to Feast For Crows and also shake off what you think is going to happen. Don't get married to the ideas you might have had about the direction of the series - but also don't be afraid. You're in good hands with Martin. Trust them. He's giving you a story bigger in scope than anything else out there. If you come into Dance With Dragons expecting him to ""refocus"" you're going to hate it. Because it doesn't. It does progress the story a great deal (despite people claiming otherwise - I honestly have no idea how to respond to people who say nothing happens in this book. I wonder if we've even read the same thing.) By the end of the book I feel like we've gotten to a major crux in the story. Not only has a TON happened, but the events of the final two books have all been nicely set up. Knowing Martin, the obvious isn't guaranteed to happen, but the way the board is set up now is certainly intriguing... The cliffhangers, though too numerous, are all on their own extremely fascinating and discussion-provoking. There is a love interest for Dany which isn't all that interesting or well written. Aside from that, I think there is a lot to like here. People have been howling about how Dany's entire arc is awful, which I disagree with. I think of all the POVs, it is probably the least well crafted and to a certain extent Martin's struggles with ""The Mereenese knot"" are apparent. But honestly, it is the type of the thing that immediately becomes more fascinating when you think about it side by side with Cersei chapters in A Feast for Crows. There seems to be a deliberate comparison of what it means to be a good queen here and in many ways it is actually quite masterfully structured / thought out. There are all sorts of echoes and clearly deliberate parallel situations occuring that each queen handles in a completely different way. Likewise, Martin is a genius at subverting how we feel about a character. There is someone you probably hated throughout the series who you will suddenly be rooting for with every fiber of your being. Not many writers can pull that off even once, but Martin does it time and time again. He even takes characters we've cheered for throughout and effortlessly grays them. This is a masterful book, in the middle of a masterpiece series. To enjoy it best embrace the scope, embrace the new characters (rather the bemoaning the somewhat abbreviated time you spend with the old ones) and let go of what you think you want to happen. There are game-changers here, but just because you're invested in what the game was doesn't mean you shouldn't be invested in what it has become (if that makes sense.) In other words, clear your head, sit back, and enjoy. This one is a wild ride. I'd also like to take a moment to remind people that the question Amazon asks isn't ""do you agree with the amount of stars I've given this book?"" They ask ""Is this review helpful?"" What I've tried to do here is present a review that is helpful for someone who hasn't read this book. If you disagree with my opinion in terms of the book's quality, I'd love to discuss if you're up for a friendly debate, but I'm not interested in bashing your amazon rating (or having you bash mine.) Please be considerate to what the question is actually asking, and if you do find that my review is not helpful, let me know why it isn't and I'll do my best to adjust. Thanks everyone! Enjoy the Dance!","2011-07-29","United States","","true","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1770L8U0BTIO8"
"B003YL4LYI","4","A Dance with Dragons","Fans have been looking forward to this one for a LONG time. A Dance with Dragons completes the story begun six years ago, when A Feast for Crows was published in October, 2005. In Feast, fans were given the full story, but only for half the characters. Fan favorites like Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow and Daenarys Targaryen were noticeably missing from the chapters of the book. Martin's now-infamous claim that Dance would be finished within a year ended up haunting him relentlessly until the day that A Dance with Dragons fell into everyone's eager hands. A Dance with Dragons not only completes the story of that missing half, but also continues the story forward. In fact, Dance is the largest book in the series, weighing in at 1,040 pages. So how does this fifth entry in the Song of Ice and Fire series match up to the rest? Read on to find out. Note: It's presumed you've read the series up to the ending of A Feast for Crows, so if you haven't, don't read on. The Prologue certainly draws comparisons to that in A Game of Thrones, taking place far north of the Wall, and giving us glimpses of the White Walkers. This serves to continue the inexorable march of the undead towards the rest of Westeros. Martin is most certainly taking his time drawing out the inevitable confrontation with the Others, however, and some readers may wonder if he'll ever be able to complete this saga, much less in the two books he claims remain. Nevertheless, it's a promising start to the novel. TYRION LANNISTER Finally, after ten long years, fans get new Tyrion material. His story begins perfectly in Dance and we see the Imp wallowing in self-pity and taking careless chances, his life no longer important to him. It doesn't take long for that attitude to change, with the help of some unlikely allies, and rather unexpected revelations. Tyrion sees his ups and downs in this novel, and his luck continues to hold, especially near the end. He's matched up with another dwarf, but where this pairing is going is hard to say. Tyrion's line that he has a heart for ""cripples, bastards and broken things,"" is never so apt as in this novel. His story does wander a bit, and he's not as endearing as in his previous forays, but he's still very much Tyrion Lannister, and he entertains us nonetheless. DAENARYS TARGARYEN Unfortunately, Daenarys Targaryen's return after a decade-long hiatus does not go as well as the dwarf's. She is certainly a willful young woman, but she borders on annoying and insolent throughout the novel. She seems to disregard every piece of advice her advisers give her, always questioning herself, but then stubbornly refusing to reconsider. Though she's the mother of dragons, we unfortunately see very little of them until the latter parts of the book, which is frustrating, considering how integral they seem they must be to the series. There are some truly exciting portions of the novel in this book, however; One scene in particular seems to be what fans have been waiting for since the moment the dragons were brought to life in the burning embers of Khal Drogo's funeral pyre. It should bring a chill to readers' spines, and was perfectly written-leaving the reader wondering about the fate of the character, of course. JON SNOW Jon arguably has the best plot line in the novel, both fleshing out his character further, as well as one of the most surprising final chapters of the book. Strange how the Starks all seem to have the best stories. There's also an early scene where Jon dispenses justice Eddard-style. It's an unexpectedly welcome scene, not only makes for good reading, but also draws the reader back into the story, which until then founders a little bit. DAVOS SEAWORTH In A Feast for Crows we learn that Davos is dead. Since Dance takes place during the same timeframe, we get to see his actual situation play out. Without spoiling things, let's just say that Davos' parts are rather boring, most of the time, though Martin leaves things sufficiently appropriate for Davos Seaworth. THEON GREYJOY It's been 13 years since we last got into the head of Theon Greyjoy, all the way back in the second book of the series, A Clash of Kings, published in 1998. Martin seemingly killed off the young kraken, but readers have heard bits and pieces about him throughout the series. In A Dance with Dragons, fans finally learn the fate of Theon. Theon's storyline is one of the most interesting of the book, second only to that of Jon Snow. BRAN STARK Bran has a very interesting story in the novel, but one that seems to end much too quickly. His almost feels like a dropped story thread, and fans will wonder what's happening with him later in the book without ever finding out. This is presumably one of the characters who will see more time in the next entry in the saga. QUENTIN MARTELL Quentin Martell is the son of the Prince of Dorne, and fans are given quite a bit of time with this character. Ultimately, his part doesn't feel that important to the story, and one is left wondering why he is even a part of it. The importance of Dorne's storyline is becoming more apparent throughout Dance, but it still feels like it's late to the party. ARYA STARK Still very much in Braavos, Arya was left blind in her last outing. Hers is one of the most involved stories in all of the Ice and Fire saga, and it continues to be no less enveloping in this latest entry. It's still unclear exactly where her thread is leading her, but fans shouldn't be disappointed by her brief appearances in Dance. VICTARION GREYJOY It's not very clear how Victarion will ultimately play into the saga, but his parts are not at all dull. JAMIE LANNISTER When the book finally catches up to the end of A Feast for Crows readers are reunited with Jamie, and his quest to unite the riverlands. He only appears in one chapter in Dance, but it's a fantastic one, with a very suitable cliffhanger ending. CERSEI LANNISTER Fans will be very pleased with Cersei's chapters in A Dance with Dragons. The queen has already been brought low, and will sink even further before things are through. Fans may even begin to feel sympathy for her in this round, though they'd be hard-pressed to ever forgive her. Cersei has been the character that fans love to hate, so Dance is all the more shocking for making her seem more human. BRIENNE OF TARTH Another character that only appears once, and not as a viewpoint character. Fans won't get a lot of information about what's been happening with her, or what her ultimate fate is, but her presence is crucial to the chapter, feels unexpected, and is perfect. THE RED PRIESTESS MELISANDRE Readers are welcomed into the mind of Melisandre for the first time in A Dance with Dragons and given a look at what her plans might be. It's revealed that she's not infallible, and can doubt herself after all. There are some reasonably surprising events revolving around Melisandre in this novel as well. STANNIS BARATHEON Readers have still not seen events from the viewpoint of the truly legitimate King, and after A Dance with Dragons, it's uncertain if it will ever happen. Indeed, Stannis has a lot to do in this book, with very little to show for it. He appears a few times early in the book, then mostly those that surround him allude to him for the remainder. It's fitting that readers should spend more time with his subjects than with the King himself, however. SER BARRISTAN SELMY Selmy is still with Daenarys and serves as the sole member of her Queensguard. Throughout the saga, he's been a bit of a secondary character, but with A Dance with Dragons, he leapfrogs right into major character status. His parts are interesting, treacherous, and fitting for the aged knight. Fans will have much more respect for Ser Barristan before the Dance is through. VARYS THE EUNUCH Appears only once, and very briefly, but is the most shocking and enjoyable chapter in the book. MISSING CHARACTERS Ultimately, there are a few characters that do not appear in the novel, their fate uncertain. - Catelyn Stark - Rickon Stark - Sansa Stark - Samwell Tarly - Peter Baelish (Littlefinger) SUMMARY A Dance with Dragons does indeed feel much like A Feast for Crows did, though is certainly a better novel; it feels dark and gritty. Winter is most certainly coming, as evidenced by Martin's use of the weather throughout the book. Once it snows in King's Landing, it's quite clear how winter is going to affect events in the series. Once Dance catches up to the ending of Feast, things move along a little faster, but this book still doesn't live up to the greatness of A Clash of Kings and the chaos that was A Storm of Swords. There are moments that drag along, and there are characters included that feel unnecessary or confusing. Fortunately, Martin moves the story along nicely in this book, and it truly feels like there's an end-game coming, though it's still unclear what exactly that is. The author has stated that there are at least two more books left in the saga, currently titled The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring. Though those titles are intriguing, A Dream of Spring doesn't sound like the title of a book that would wrap up this amazing series. It seems like in a song of Ice and Fire, things should end in a blazing inferno, and fire should be a part of the title. Mayhaps there will be another entry in the series. Time will tell, of course, but with the delay between these books growing longer, let's hope not too much time is necessary.","2012-07-29","United States","","true","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TUA2CKFE6Q5R"
"B003YL4LYI","5","Deep Breath.","Deep, deep breath. I have been among the legion of fans who have had to sit the entire wait of YEARS for this book. I got A Feast for Crows on day one, and on day one many years later came A Dance With Dragons. I really, really didn't want to read it. Bare with me, a review is coming, but to understand the hate and vitriol in the other interviews this explanation is necessary. Before AFfC, Martin's brilliant novels were running on fewer, tighter plotlines, and a major revelation awaited in each one. Often more than one major revelation actually. Then AFfC came out, and despite being warned, we all cried foul to see that many of our favorite characters simply weren't involved. So there we were, having finished a book that seemed to have shorted us a bit, with a promise of the next book to be delivered after a short wait. Six years later we get what is essentially AFfC part 2, with an addendum containing the beginning of the next book. We started this leg of the journey very angry with AFfC, and over the years, and delays, we became more angry. We began to lose hope that the series would finish at all. And if nothing else, that sort of passion and hopelessness should let you know just how amazing this series is at connecting directly into you. Expectations were high. Just four months shy of six years after AFfC it's here: A Dance with Dragons. And that six years is the problem... A Dance with Dragons brings back the missing characters from AFfC, and as it begins there is nothing to complain about. Taken as a whole the book is clearly the middle of the road between acts two and three of the story entire. Having that in mind I think you'll enjoy it very much. Especially if you are a true fan of the series. So those of you who are, and who may be thinking about not buying (you know you will eventually), go ahead and buy it. It's Martin. It's his writing, it's his characters, and it's the same world you fell in love with over the rest of the four books. Stories as long as this have parts that may not seem to do much, but that's because the major consequences of the things that happen in A Dance wont be fully known until the start of the NEXT book. Dance is the literary equivalent of the story slowing down to stretch it's legs for the sprint. But it being written by Martin, as long as you keep that in mind, you can take a longer view and realize exactly what it is he's setting up. And what he's setting up is a MASSIVE shake-up in nearly every political, religious, and even supernatural facet of the world he's made. He's laying the path for events that will change things to such an extent that I think it may turn out to be unprecedented in fantasy literature. Let that sink in for a bit. A Dance With Dragons features less epic style action, and more personal, small conflicts. It takes the characters away from what they know, and it puts them in the thick of places they might not even belong. It's a growing experience for each and every character in the book. The problem is that these new paths are not the end of old paths. You see we as fans have wanted conclusions to some very major story points, we collectively assumed that Martin wouldn't be expanding his story any further, only staying with what he'd begun and starting to wrap it up. He didn't do that. So all of us who were reading with baited breath to find out, for instance, about Jon's parents were left in the dark. We end a Jon chapter and find that a new character is being introduced, and it seemingly has nothing at all to do with what was hinted at before. This makes us angry. But take a deep breath. The reason we were all here in the first place is precisely because of Martin's writing. This man, undoubtedly, knows what he's doing. He's 5 of 7 into what I think is going to be recognized as possibly THE fantasy series for mature audiences. We should not be angry that he didn't write what WE would have written. It's not our story to finish. It's his. And you can even take it a bit further. Re-read the first books and you'll notice how many small hints are dropped about Valyria, then come back to Dance to find that there is now a journey TO Valyria. I believe he's trying to tie up more than just the stories of the great houses we've been following. I think he's trying to tie up the bulk of his entire mythos by the end. And read more. Notice that until Dance with Dragons we had no idea that there would be a SINGLE commander of the white walkers and the things beyond the wall (and that it may be the very one who is training Bran). We didn't know the people of the forests were alive. No, I think Martin is right on track. I think he's doing brilliantly. I think I'm more than happy to give my patience and trust in him not leaving us in a lurch. A Song of Ice and Fire will have an ending. Please just take a deep breath and realize how stupid it would have been of him to start tying off all those incredible loose ends with two more books to go. Westeros just took a deep breath (and I took one with it), the next book will be the beginning of the plunge, and the last will be the plunge itself. But this book. This one stands as a worthy addition to the story. It didn't go precisely where all of us wanted, in fact it spent a lot of time in a place that was as unpleasant for us as it was for a few of the characters in it. But there is a real sense of the slow beginnings of inertia near the end. When even more characters start popping in and when the dual storylines running parallel in AFfC and ADwD finally do end... you can feel it start to move. By the end I was left feeling that all of that spreading out of story and plotlines and character arcs was about to start converging. Dance, along with Feast, are very singular events in publishing. They only came about because we, the fans, demanded Martin not skip forward several years. We wanted to know what happened. And he gave it to us. The last two books were those written precisely so that we wouldn't feel cheated. Martin cared so much about fan outcry that he wrote two extra books. I for one am greatful. The more I read from him about this world the better. For five books now we've said it along with all the Starks: ""Winter is Coming."" By the end of this book... winter is here. And NOW the fun begins. Just don't take another decade to finish this George. Please.","2011-07-27","United States","","true","4","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YWJZMKD81BG4"
"B003YL4LYI","5","Give me a break! This is still one of the best epic fantasies ever crafted!!","Well, the long wait for A DANCE WITH DRAGONS is over, and we finally get to hear from some of our favorite characters from A Song of Ice and Fire. Jon, Daenerys, Bran, and Tyrion take center stage here in the 'companion' volume to A FEAST FOR CROWS. And while the story hasn't picked up the pace to the level of A STORM OF SWORDS, there are definite areas of acceleration and the story is quite obviously being guided towards a specific goal by the masterful hand of GRRM. I know this review will probably earn 10 unhelpful votes within an hour of its being posted simply from being positive, but I wanted to present the plus side of what is still in my opinion the strongest epic fantasy currently running (the negatives have been adequately covered I would say). First of all, so much of what made the first three books in this series so powerful is still present here. The quality of writing and character development, the realistic grittiness and coldness of the setting, the brutal and painful experiences of the characters that make the reader squirm, and the constant foreshadowing of the horrors of the approaching Winter, are the tried and true formula for this series, and that hasn't changed here. One of the most well-developed fantasy settings ever imagined only continues to grow, with more maps, more fleshed-out legends and history, and more well-defined geography and landscape. The arcane has become more prominent, with magic influencing A DANCE WITH DRAGONS more than the previous books, but still the gods and their magic remain mysterious forces, mostly in the background. If you have loved this series for the well-imagined world and characters, you'll love this book too. Also, Martin is finally starting to rein in the expansion of story-lines here. It is plain to see the effort to draw many of the disparate stories into a few cohesive groups, with an apparent focus on actually getting this mega-epic to a point where an inclusive conclusion is possible. Two books ago I couldn't imagine how Martin might possibly bring all of these stories to an end, but now I can just glimpse a speck of light at the end of the tunnel. Not that I even try any more to predict where this is going. I think you're fooling yourself if you think you know where this journey ends, as major plot twists are still the rule, rather than the exception in this series. Who saw Daenerys marrying a Meereneese? or Theon regaining the hero's seat? And for those that say this book doesn't progress the story, I just don't see how that argument can be made. Every chapter here serves a purpose to march these characters towards some definite conclusion. Not every chapter serves up battle, death, or assassination, but every chapter gets us to where we're going. Despite being over 1000 pages, there isn't wasted space here. While it is plain to see that this book left a bitter taste in many fans' mouths, What did people expect here? We knew this was going to take place in the same timeline as A Feast for Crows, and we knew it was going to be mostly set up for the final books of the series, but people somehow expected world-altering events and conclusive endings for major story-lines? This series is a perfect example of enjoying the ride for its own sake and letting the end arrive in its own time. While I hope that the rest of the series is completed in a much more timely manner than these last two books, in the end, those books will be judged based on their own merits, not on the amount of time it took them to reach me. In some ways, all of the attention and seeming outrage over this fifth installment of the series speaks to the strength the previous books have had. I'm not sure where the insane expectations for this book came from, but just the fact that they exist is a testament to the quality and power of these books. Call me a fan-boy, but to me, this series remains one of the best of all time, and A DANCE WITH DRAGONS simply represents one more step along an amazing journey. Martin's epic saga is able to draw you in, mesmerize you, beat you up, and spit you out as nothing else in literature. Very Highly Recommended!!","2012-03-29","United States","","true","5","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L1FD1ZYK9DJ"
"B003YL4LYI","5","I will miss this series as we wait for Book Six...","[UPDATE] In addition to my original review (below), I wanted to point a couple of things out to other readers giving this and the other four books low ratings, and to provide a dose of fairness and perspective for prospective readers to consider. First, this is not the television series, it is a collection of books for ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" as written by George R. R. Martin before HBO turned them into the foundation for their own version known as ""Game of Thrones"" (a so-called ""game of thrones"" being a central subplot in the series of books). The stories told by the books and by the HBO series are similar but not necessarily the same. The books are far more detailed, allow for much more character development, and truly go into all of the history and dynamics of certain story lines, much of which the ""Game of Thrones"" shows cannot get into because they are limited to a dozen or so episodes per season with each episode being between 50 and 55 minutes based on how HBO runs things. The shows are not the same as the books; the shows are based somewhat loosely on the books; the shows leave a lot of important things out as far what the books contain; and, the books are not written so as to hold your attention for about one hour per week for several weeks out of the year (if they were, it would take you a couple of decades to read the books!). That being said, if you enjoy the show (it is a great show), stick with watching it until the HBO series' finale and then consider picking up and reading the books. Otherwise you will find yourself enjoying (or maybe not enjoying) two different stories that do have some similarities but leave you asking, ""Why did HBO leave those characters out until now or why did they choose not to include that critical event?"" Second, the books are not written so that every character is part of every chapter or every few chapters with one long continuous storyline. Martin says as much when he explains how he wrote the books and why he chose to write them the way he did. Read all of what Martin writes and you will know this to be true (there's more than the Introduction, character chapters, and Epilogue to be read). If you focus only on the fact that each chapter is written from one character's point of view for a time that may have come before, during or after a previous chapter, then you will see the books only as a series of short stories involving related characters. However, if you pay attention to the details as you read the books, you will see little things explained or experienced by one character in a given chapter that relates to something that has been experienced or foretold by another character in a previous chapter so that all the chapters are tied back to a central storyline. This is how Martin has written the books, this makes it possible to develop an entire world full of many different characters in vivid detail, and this is what makes each book a true page turner (at least for me). If you did not enjoy this type of storytelling in the first three books (especially the third book), then why did you continue reading two more very long books for a story written in a way that you do not like? [ORIGINAL REVIEW] A fantastic fifth installment of the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series. I have loved reading these five books. This series of books are now all in my Top Five favorites. I can only hope that Lord Martin sees fit to bestow gifts of early deliveries for the final two books in the series upon his leal and avid fans... If you have enjoyed the first four books as much as I did, this fifth one will not disappoint.","2013-06-20","United States","","true","6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R704C1QYZ91XE"
"B003YL4LYI","5","When he wins he loses apparently","I never understand the fans that expect too much from an author and it seems many of Martin's readers are just this breed. This book despite it's many 1-4 star reviews is still without a doubt worth all five. If you found this book slow or laboring I'm sorry but perhaps you should take up a new hobby other then reading. In every one of Martin's books I found myself skimming some of the less interesting character chapters in this one I skimmed only one complete one and half of another one that picked up enough to force me to read it. Considering I skimmed about five per book (7 in AFFC)I really am perplexed by the other readers reaction to this engaging and wonderfully written book. The people complaining of cliff hanger obviously haven't read the rest of the series to completely as this is what he does every time normally with at least 4 characters yet the only real cliff hanger in this one involves the possible death of one of the mains. The rest was resolved perfectly to set up the rest for the next two books. This one literally had me cheering out loud multiple times (much to my wife's dismay as many of these were in the middle of the night). The book resolves just enough with every character again with one exception to keep you ready and anxious for the next two books which if you expected things to come to a head before then you were only fooling yourself. Considering how many characters are represented I'm surprised the book is even nearly as short as it is (almost a thousand pages and it still seemed too short. Needless to say I found the Book equally engaging as the second and third books, superior by far to the fourth, and inferior only to the original which isn't a reflection at all considering it is one of the greatest novels ever written in this reviewers humble opinion. In short the book is almost perfect with only a few faults it maintains well the writing and character of all it's predecessors and anyone who says otherwise is simply delusional or spoiled by our ""give it to me now"" world culture, and I for one am excited for whatever Mr. Martin serves us next. If there is any doubt to the delusions of the individual giving this 1 star just try to compare it to other highly praised novels (Hunger Games, Twilight). So buy this book if you enjoy reading you'll love it, if you have the attention span of a monkey no doubt you'll find way of putting this book down and trying to justify your lack of taste, attention, and judgement. edit Some one pointed out the ""provocative nature"" of my review So I reworked the last line. If you like reading and you read the previous books in this series than buy this book you will love it because it is the exact same fare, the same characterizations, and same character development, the same intrigue, the same plots the same threads wound tighter together, If you have read the other books and do not enjoy this then your tastes have changed, or you have a very small attention span (smaller than someone with a sever case of ADHD like myself), or you lack the judgement skill necessary to critique a book based on what it is vs what you wanted or expected it to be. If you haven't read this series buy them all and read them all chances are you will enjoy them.","2011-07-23","United States","","true","7","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35W2IQGS5QQDT"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Mind Boggling!","Mind Boggling! Another interesting and mind boggling book added to the series. The drama continues with many twist and turns as plots within plots materialize. The book itself was not smooth flowing until the second half of the book. The chapters seem to cover the in-between scenarios that happened either before or after some of the drama that unfolded in the last 4 books. These chapters were in no order and I got bored with too much description of the surrounding lands, their histories, and the men who came beforehand. I just had a hard time getting through some of the chapters because it was at a stand still with nothing happening that was in my opinion not relevant to the main plot or maybe it was just me being impatient and wanting to get to the main point of finding out the outcome. Everyone in this series is going mad to take over the seven kingdoms, not just one king within the seven but several lords in their own lord-hoods. To top it off, there are those outside the seven kingdoms across seas that have their sights on the throne as well but their kingdoms are full of their own destruction and underhandedness of chaos to include all the cut throats fighting each other to gain the princess and her dragons to take the throne. Yet all the while, evil magical and paranormal forces consume the ordinary folk through false religious covers (sorcery/demon worship) and old magical powers. Overall though, the many plots within continue to get closer to a climax. Hopefully the readers don't have to read through 5 more books to get to there. The writing is great and the characters are well established and just when you think you have a favorite character the author has a way of making the good one bad and the bad one a hero. Great Read! ******** Spoilers Below this Point ************** NOTES to read before I read the 6th book whenever it is released: Night's Watch Jon Snow - one of my favorite characters and his white Dire wolf. I like what he does by opening the gates to the wildlings and in this book his sworn brothers are not happin with him and in this book in the end Jon is stabbed but it doesnt state whether he is dead or not because Lady Melisandre the red priestess is there and you never know what kind of sorcery she will do. 2. Samwell Tarly is not mentioned in this book House Stark 1. Bran is beneath ground with the Three Eyed Crow (last greenseer/sorcerer)and the children of the forest. He has become part of the Direwood and is learning to fly but this book doesn't spend much time on him, just one chapter. Hodor is still with him. 2. Rickon - this book doesn't cover him at all and he was split from Bran in the 4th book. He is with Osha the wildling woman. 3. Jon Snow still doesn't know his brothers live. 4. Lady Stark is still alive in the 4th book but she is not mention in this book. ********** ********** House Tully 1. Bends the knee to King Tommen in the book due to Jamie Lannister. ******** ******** King of the Seven Kingdoms 1. Tommen - 8 year old King, son of (ex Queen)Cersei 2. Cersei - ex Queen - yes I hate her and she is finally charged with treason, insest, fornication and was degraded through out the city by having to walk naked through her own people - she deserves death but we won't know what her outcome is until after her trial when Ser Robert Strong fights for her innocence. 3. Ser Jaime Lannister - bad guy gone good, however the book leaves Jaime in limbo and was last seen takeing off with Ser Brienia 4. Tyrion Lannister - My favorite character! I love his sense of humor, his part in this series is the best. In this book he finds himself across seas mixed up with a knight and another dwarf and are slaves. Tyrion does get himself and his company out of the slavement but signs away with lots of promises that he may not be able to keep. 5. Ser Kevan lannister - I liked him, he is Cersei's Uncle but he is killed at the end of the book. 6. Margaery - New Queen, married to Tommen - I like her sweet personality but you can tell that she is up to something in the long run. 7. The People of the Faith - The High Septon - I hate those religious freaks. ***** ***** King at the Wall 1. Stannis Baratheon - Rightful King some think and in this book he is at Castle Black for a while until he goes out during the on coming of winter to take over Winterfell but in the end of this book it is left in limbo with everyone thinking he was taken and killed. 2. Lady Melisandre - The Red Women, a priestess of R'hllor, the lord of light - I can't stand this women. This is where the evil comes in or sorcery comes in. She burns people to get a seeing in the fire. 3. Mance Rayder - King beyond the Wall - this guy is suspecious and I don't trust him. I think him and Melisandre are up to no good and will change everyone to demons or something in the end but in this book it is left with him still missing from castle rock and no one has heard from him. He was suppose to have been burned but Melisandre used magic to disguise Rattleshirt (Lord of Bones)as him in order to fake the death. 4. Ser Davos Seaworth - King Stannis Hand but in the book he is left in limbo - he was captured but secretly released so he could gather a force for King Stannis. ******* ******* King of the Isles and the North 1. Euron GreyJoy - Crow's Eye - King of the Isles and the North. This part was the most boring. 2. Victarion GreyJoy - Euron's brother - this guy is full of himself, at end he is on his way to claim the Princess Dani and her dragons for himself instead of for his brother Euron. 3. Asha GreyJoy - I love her, she is one tough cookie. She however is captured by Stannis and in the end in limbo, we don't know if she is still with Stannis or not. ****** ****** House Arryn - The Vale In this book the Vale is not mentioned but in book 4 Robert Arryn, otherwise known as sweet robin, he becomes King as his mother is thrown off the mountain by her husband Petyr Baelish (Littlefinger). Sansa Stark is posing as Alayne Stone - Lord Petyr's natural daughter. Last happenings was they were coming down the mountain before winter hit. ******* ******* House Frey The Freys are with Ramsey Bolton and Ramsey has married the fake Ayra Stark that Jammie Lannister sent in order for him to gain control of Winterfel. ************ ************ Across Seas 1. Arya Stark is with the Kindly Man and the servants of the Many Faced God. She is being trained to be a fighter and assassin In Braavos. 2. Daenerys Targaryen - Dani - rightfull heir to the Seven Kingdoms. Lots of drama goes on all around her. She finally gets to ride one of her dragons (Drogon). She gets married to Hizdahr a wealthy Meereenese nobleman in order to save her children from starvation and killings. Howwever, all kinds of chaos happens and now she is off away with her dragon. Her other dragons get free at the cost of a Doran prince whom is burned to crisp by one of the dragons. Hizdahr is taken afterward by Dani's protector Ser Barristan Selmy and is acussed of treason and trying to kill her and her dragons.","2014-01-12","United States","","true","8","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GW1CAWKGAX16"
"B003YL4LYI","3","Honest review from a fan and a customer","Edited: 3/20/2013 (I re-read the book, wanting to give it another chance after watching the very well done television series, but my feelings generally remain the same with some new insights) Warning: I do not give specific story spoilers, but some of my comments can be considered spoilers to the structure of the story. So, to lighten the blow a little first, I will make it clear that I am a fan of the Song of Ice and Fire series. Like many others, I think the first three books were some of the best fantasy books in recent history. They held my interest like few others, took directions many other writers would not dare to take and had me itching to read the next. I'm a fan who checked on the status of this book at least a couple dozen times through each year to see how the progress was coming and I'm a fan who also believes in a writer taking the time he or she needs to do it properly. While I honestly was a little impatient to read the next book (which is a good thing, unless you're attacking the author over it), I could not fault someone for wanting to do other things with their lives. As far as the positives for A Dance with Dragons specifically, Martin continues to show a strong and addicting narrative style with a great attention to detail without going too overboard most of the time. His use of language remains strong with some good character insights and quotes derived from it, and there are a number of moments in the book that were intriguing. These are the reasons why I gave it three stars and if a lesser writer had authored the book, I probably would have never finished it. And before I go into my criticisms of the book, there is something I would like to note. While I often take the side of artists in artistic work, we have to be honest in realizing that the book series is also a commodity. It is not something just written for artistic purposes. When something is put on the market for sale, it is subject to the scrutiny of its consumers. That said, A Dance with Dragons (and A Feast for Crows) bored me in comparison to the first three books, and while I would like to read how the story ends, I am hesitant to invest more time and money into the book series. I may just be a customer, reader, and fan, so what would I know about editing, story-building, etc., and GRRM may be the professional writer and it went through professional editors, but they still made a cardinal writing error that I so often hear you should not make: They did not keep the story moving. By the end of the book, I felt almost nothing happened. I believe at this point in a book series' life, the story needs to be picking up faster and faster. You need down times of course, and a little exposition in each book to get everyone up to speed again is a good thing...but not through the majority of the book. Things need to happen and you need to have control of the story. I'll give an example. Say you saw a fight at work and you are telling someone about it. You would probably give them a lead up and let them know it was at work between two employees who were not getting along recently, you would probably give them background information like the significant other of one of the employees was cheating with the other employee. You may talk about how another employee that was friends with both revealed that information and hence, betrayed one of those friends. Then, you would describe the fight and its aftermath. What you would probably not talk about is how you stubbed your toe on the way to the car to get to work, the more scenic route that you happened to take that morning, or what you ate at breakfast, lunch, or dinner, or describe in exhausting detail your work duties leading up to the point of the fight. No one cares about these details and you are slowing the story down to a crawl. And say you do all this, even talk about the events related to the actual fight, then you do not actually get to the fight and say, ""I'll tell you about the fight next time."" Now, imagine that fight being told by seventeen other people, including people who are near irrelevant to the story. This is what A Dance with Dragons felt like to me. The drawn out version of a story with a poorly handled cliffhanger. I really feel that Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons are books that maybe shouldn't have been written or at the very least, heavily edited. I could even say that they could have been condensed into one book between 500-700 pages axed between the two of them (and still have time to put in events that could have made them better). I understand that the author originally planned a time skip by five years after Storm of Swords and honestly, I felt that would have been better. Between the two books, I just felt very little moved forward in terms of the actual story and they could have easily been left out without hurting the overall story. Of course, there will be many people (probably the majority) disagreeing with me and that is their full right to do so. We're all entitled to our opinions. If you loved Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons or just love to soak up everything you can from the story's world, then that's awesome. If you felt you got your money's and time's worth, then that is great. I wish I could have enjoyed them as much as you. I really do. But I didn't. On that note, I hope that The Winds of Winter will be a return to form for Martin's writing. However, after the last two books, I know better than to purchase it on day one, and depending on the feedback it gets, I may opt to not purchase it at all and check it out from a library, instead. And I am not entirely sure I will even do that, I'm sad to say.","2011-07-14","United States","","true","9","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NMQV4ZDQ47D7"
"B003YL4LYI","5","Better than night soil!","To preface this review, I wanted to inform you that this is a review of the unabridged audio-book version of A Dance With Dragons (ADWD). Every word of the book is read to the listener in an unabridged reading with the actor changing his voice slightly for different characters and using a neutral voice for narration. I have listened to all of a A Song Of Ice And Fire (ASOIF) in audio-book format as I simply don't have time to sit down and read such lengthy novels. I highly recommend this type of ""reading"" for people who have to commute a lot or spend lots of time working with their hands on mindless tasks (for me this entails renovating my 1850 home and landscaping the backyard). Not wanting to write a spoiler review, let me just say ""wow, I did not see that coming!"" I think you will be shocked toward the end of the book - I was both saddened and very curious to know more. I can't say more than that without spoiling it. A Dance With Dragons is better than night soil! In regards to how long it took for Martin to write this book, I agree with Brent Weeks' opinion post that George's readers probably shouldn't have to wait almost 6 years for the release of a book, but on the other-hand I can understand why it would take so long to write a book like ADWD. It seems to me the average author takes one to two years to write a book. ADWD is fully twice the length of the average novel that comes out - it is truly epic in both scope and words. In addition, George was working on other books in that time-frame as well as dealing with the HBO adaptation of A Game Of Thrones. With these considerations, I see how it could take between three and six years to write the sequel (or in this case parallel) to A Feast For Crows (AFFC). Still, I just wish it didn't have to take that long. Now that the initial push with HBO is done, with all the publicity and now Hollywood behind him, and a horde of new fans bugging him, I think we can expect to see the next book in the Song coming along within two years - but really, who am I to say? All that out of the way, now onto the meat of the review. ADWD is an exquisitely written gritty tale, peppered throughout with colorful terms such as ""night soil"" pulling its readers a little deeper into George's imagination with every page turned. Simply stated, Martin is just an excellent writer and his huge world is highly organized. The scope is vast with so many plot-lines, sub plot-lines, and side plot-lines keeping the reader entertained and always guessing. His story contains many players - both main and side characters - and you never really know which ones are going to die next. George revisits some of the characters that we didn't see in AFFC just enough to keep us up to date on what is going on in their lives, while he focuses more on other characters and developing their stories more fully. You will find yourself falling in love with characters you hated in previous books, and you will despise some characters even more! George does a great job with getting us to know his characters, understand what is in their minds and hearts, what motivates them and gets them to do the things they do and even why they repent. It is a joy to watch martin break his characters both mentally and physically as he does it so fantastically. George really knows how to tell a tale and ADWD will leave every epic fantasy reader satisfied that they got their money's worth. This tale stretches across two continents and really beings to bring the whole story we've been reading thus far together. And the dragons, wow! These are some ferocious beasts. These creatures are not the little dragonlings that were crawling on Daenerys' shoulder on the HBO version of A Game Of Thrones. These creatures are huge behemoths that can spout large gouts of flame effortlessly and endlessly to consume their prey and foes. These dragons are nasty, nasty creatures - there is not much controlling them as they are truly wild beasts. As with the other stories in the Song, ADWD does move along rather slowly compared to many other authors out there. You are however rewarded with richer detail, but not so much as some authors I've read who make you want to skip five pages just to find out what is going on. George balances description with plot very well - perhaps balanced more on the description side, but not too much that he keeps you from wanting to read further. It is a page turner and you won't want to put it down. The only true downfall I can put on this book is that it is actually only half of a story. A Feast For Crows and A Dance With Dragons are mostly written parallel to one another as the scope of the series has become so vast, Martin simply can't capture a section of a timeline in one book. While I knew this before I even started ADWD, I ended up missing my favorite characters like Samwell, Brienne, and of course Jaime. We do catch snippets of them, but I miss reading them especially after we've been waiting more than 5 years. ADWD and AFFC being the whole of a single book also begs the question, will ASOIAF be eight books long now (previously the series was estimated to be 7)? George seems to be holding true to his philospohy that evil always triumphs over good, chaos over order, falsehood over truth, and darkness over light. But as always he leaves the door open just a crack so that at the end of this series (however long it may be) the good guys could still possibly win out and may indeed triumph. But time is running out. Winter is here. It is a fact that can now be seen even on the Dothraki Sea. Are the dragons going to be the power that defeats the mysterious god of ice we've barely heard mention of? Who is Varys actually working for? Lots of questions arise from reading ADWD and hopefully they will begin to be answered in the next book. Recently ADWD was voted on goodreads.com to be the best fantasy novel of the year by readers like you and I. This is definitely deserved. I voted for Patrick Rothfuss' The Wise Man's Fear and even after having finished ADWD I would not change my vote. It was a tough year for Pat going against George. I am sure Wise Man would have won had there not been the media hog (deservedly so) that ADWD has become because of HBO. I'd bet 80% of the votes for ADWD would have gone to Rothfuss had ADWD not been in the running, putting it probably on the top, closely contested with Erin Morgenstern's breakout novel (which is definitely now in my to-read list). But those are the breaks - they WERE released the same year and even if both ADWD and TWMF are excellent stories deserving of the number one spot, ""there can be only one""! I am very happy to give A Dance With Dragons 5 out of 5 stars!","2011-12-09","United States","","true","10","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NOMWY5CHJ60K"
"B003YL4LYI","3","Epic Saga of How House Targaryen Got its Throne Back and Saved the Realms of Man","I want to start by saying that whenever I finish a book that I have questions about I look to Amazon reviews for insight and perspective. And I find it, even when I disagree. I glanced at the star rating for ADWD the day my copy of the book arrived; a mere day or so after the book was available; there were 300 reviews and the average star rating was 3. When I finished the book and returned to Amazon to get insight and perspective, there were over 750 reviews. It was telling that the reviews considered most helpful by readers were the 2 and 3 star ones written by people who loved the series and were disappointed in ADWD. I agree with some comments about slow plot development; non-resolution of storylines; endless, irrelevant details, repetitions and cruelties; lack of critical editing; and the great Theon story arc. I disagree with other comments, some of which I will address in the body of this piece, but my main focus is discussing ADWD and ASOFAI from another perspective. There will be SPOILERS--be so advised. AGOT begins at Winterfell with the Stark family awaiting Ned's good friend and king Robert Baratheon. We quickly learn: Starks are our heroes; King Robert is good, but flawed; Lannisters are bad. Fiercely loyal and honorable Ned, bringing his daughters with him, follows King Robert to Court. At the same time, Ned sends his mysteriously origined bastard son off to exile at the ever cold Wall where men serve until death, taking no wives, fathering no children and getting their head cut off if they decide that that hard, thankless life isn't for them. We gather he does this because his wife doesn't like being reminded of her husband's infidelity. Through-out AGOT, we accept that Robert Baratheon belongs on the Iron Throne because Mad King Aeyrs Targaryen was unfit to rule. The one person who might have a better claim to the Iron Throne, Prince Viserys, is horrible. Possibly less horrible than Prince Joffrey, but we never find out. About the time Ned gets his head cut-off, Daenerys Stormborn brings magic back into the world. I think that the themes, progression and journey of the whole series are set out in the second book, ACOK, in two Daenerys POV chapters: 1) when Quaithe gives her advice and 2) when Daenerys visits the House of the Undying Ones. I often return to the latter POV to get a sense of where the story is going. This is the great reversal of the series; as it continues we learn that we were misled into believing that King Robert belonged on the throne, that he was good and the Stark family noble. Robert Baratheon was a Usurper and his pal Ned Stark, a traitor. The Iron Throne belongs to House Targaryen. A digression here: Ned's death was shocking, but not unreasonable: when a character is maimed--Ned's leg was surely gangrenous--and his story arc has no place to go, he is often killed off. The epic here with room for lots of battles, magic and characters is The Saga of How House Targaryen Got the Iron Throne Back, Ensured Succession and Saved the Realms of Man for Another Thousand Years. That's the story I thought I was getting even through AFFC, but then GRRM spent the nearly 1000 page ADWD on minutia, with only the occasional pause for brilliance. It is wonderful to spend time with favorite characters. Yet when the real story hasn't even begun it seems wasteful to spend so many pages on turning Cersei into Lucretia Borgia; on everybody travelling endlessly on storm-tossed seas to some destination they never reach; on characters that start out interesting and then peter away or just disappear. Remember Robert's bastards? Why did we even care about Edric Storm, Gendry, Mya if the legitimacy of Cersei's children will become a moot point? Why was the promising Brienne turned into Don Quijote, totally incompetent and incapable of accomplishing any mission--and why in the name of the Seven did GRRM maim her? That is the problem with GRRM adding character upon character. For R'hllor's sake, finish off some minor storylines before beginning others. The wonder of the series for me is the world GRRM has created. Not just the cities and people that exist now, but the mythology. The way this family and that trace their ancestry back to the Andals or the First Men. Passing through the sea around Valyria, still boiling and deadly centuries after the Doom, an Atlantisesque volcanic eruption(?), gave me goose-bumps. Tyrion's journey down the river is wonderful because Tyrion appreciated the ruins of civilizations that once were and no longer are: a marvelous lesson for any would-be royal adviser. But when Tyrion fell off the boat saving Prince Aegon, he should have drowned. Here was a character so full of self-loathing, who committed crimes so heinous that his story arc was irredeemable: his redemption and end should have come during that amazing scene through the Palace of Sorrow, as sad as it would have been to lose him. Instead GRRM brought him back, gave him a personality transplant and Tyrion was re-born as an oaf better suited to the grotesquerie outside the walls of Meereen than as a royal adviser. Some characters should just stay dead. I like how the petty concerns of men--who sits on the Iron Throne--contrasts with the real problem--the destruction of the realms of man--that waits at the Wall. The Wall that we learn in ADWD was once manned by Knights and is now the domain of bastards, criminals and those Dickensian children people are always trying to get rid of in novels has its own mythology spanning millennia. When the Westerosi utter the curse ""May the Others take him"" (a phrase I love hearing over and over), it's because there have been no Others for 1000 years. A thousand years! Only Jon Snow sees the implication of the wilding flight south: if they are afraid of the Others, the entire realm is in danger, which is why his character is essential to the story. A digression: Melisandre has turned into the Aunt Clara of the priests of R'hllor; she sees things in the fire, but darn if she doesn't misinterpret them. So if she thinks the children of the forest are bad, they are probably good. Heck, she asks to see AA, gets Jon, and is annoyed by the vision. Another digression: I like that Jon's raven repeats itself. Ravens do that. And it is a way to get information to Jon (and us (through Bran?)). I think the character of Prince Aegon is an important addition. In the scene in the House of the Undying Ones in ACOK, Dany sees Rhaegar, who we'll come to understand was a pretty decent guy, saying to a woman nursing a baby named Aegon, ""He has a song.... He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire."" Many of us thought the woman was Lyanna and the baby Jon, but Lyanna died in childbirth after Rhaegar's death so it could never have been Jon. The story needs Prince Aegon. Not only because the dragon has three heads, but because if Mirri Maz Duur's curse is true, Dany will never have a living child and the story is incomplete without a succession plan for House Targaryen. Up to this point, I had expected that the curse would be circumvented Macduff style where the baby is born dead, but comes to life after his stillbirth. Having a second Targaryen (remember even if Jon is the third head, he is still sworn to the NW and can't become king or father legitimate children) as a compliment to Dany is a good thing. A word about the Stark children: they are our guides through the world of the series. They are the small-folk whose rights get trampled when lords play the game of thrones (a phrase I hope never to see again). Maester Aemon gave Jon some advice: kill the boy and let the man be born. No one ever gave Robb that advice and he ended up dead as a result of his own irresponsible actions: marriage contracts should not be broken no matter how cute the girl. I hope the remaining Stark children make it to the end of the series, but they have become witnesses and not actors (with the possible exception of Jon Snow, who might not turn out to be a Stark child after all). Some readers have commented that GRRM lost control of his story, ran out of drive or energy or wanted to run up the book count. I thought that he just liked the world of the series and wanted to stay there for a while. I understand; I have favorite characters that I like spending time with: Arya, Tyrion before his resurrection, Jon and Dany, but stories must have an end. If it is no less than five years between books and GRRM plans at least three more, I worry one of us won't live long enough to get to the end. GRRM has an advantage over me; he actually has an idea how the story turns out. After reading Amazon reviews, I am worried that GRRM really has lost his way. Otherwise, why would he have Jon, Tyrion and Varys do such stupid and uncharacteristic things for such stupid reasons? I cut Dany some slack because she is very young and this is the first time in her life that she feels safe. I will wait for TWOW and hope that HBO pushes GRRM to bring it out in a respectable time frame. I will hope that the Old Gods grant GRRM a tough editor who sets him on the correct path and that he stops maiming, humiliating, torturing and killing his good characters. GRRM had his irresponsible would-be kings and their armies burn the fields of Westeros with Winter Coming. People are already eating their dead--and it's only fall--so I guess my petition that he stop serving dogs, rats and the dead as entrees will go unfulfilled. One reviewer thought that Tyrion is GRRM's alter ego---might I suggest Ramsey Snow? I hope that the author of ADWD is reborn as the author of AGOT/ACOK/ASOS and that TWOW delights.","2011-08-12","United States","","true","11","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R159Q01RWJCWUO"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Maybe he owes his fans an ending.","All the while I'm reading this book, I’m wondering. When is the Battle of the Bastards? When is Jon’s parentage revealed? The title is A Dance with Dragons. Where are the dragons? When does Drogon lay waste to the Lannister army? As I reach the midway point of the book. Tyrion has spent months on the road, realistically so, for it would take months to travel by carriage halfway across a continent the size of Essos. Tyrion still hasn’t met with Daenerys. That’s when I realized something was missing. There wasn’t enough time in the book for the above-mentioned to happen. Being the sweet-summer child I was back then, and recently watched the show, and then read all the books shortly after. I had no idea George R.R. Martin never finished the books, and I never heard of The Winds of Winter or A Dream of Spring. But winter is finally here. With a tad bit of research, I soon learned all the hoopla surrounding the end of the show, and Martin never finished the books. I think the Game of Thrones show is arguably the greatest ever on TV, and I was just fine with how it ended. A little theory of mine is that seasons 6,7, and 8 will make up the bulk of The Winds of Winter (a safe, and obvious bet to make), and A Dream of Spring will start soon after. With Arya sailing west of Westeros, Sansa remaining Queen in the North, and Jon and Tormund battling giant Ice Spiders north of the Wall. As for this massive tome of a book. It comes in at a whopping 1016 pages, with appendices of all the great houses and major players included. There are in-book maps of Beyond the Wall, The Free Cities, and Valyria, as well as the customary maps of the north and south of Westeros. All your favorite POV’s are back. Jon, Tyrion, and Daenerys lead the way in this epic slow-burn of a tale. Buckle in for this one, folks, it’s going to be long.","2025-04-29","United States","","true","12","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R191WM4BTDH1TY"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Half-way Through (Now Completed: Update)","[No spoilers] Part 1: Half-way Through Before purchasing this book, I'd read a lot of reviews that [among other things, see below, Part 2] stated how agonizingly s-l-o-w ""A Dance with Dragons"" (ADWD) was, and how folks felt cheated out of the thrills they were anticipating due to the deliberate pacing. Well, I'd really enjoyed the previous four books, so - following minimal internal debate - decided to give this one a chance. Scattered among the negative reviews are those wherein folks describe abandoning the book after a few score pages - some more, some less. About 100 pages in, I thought it'd be appropriate to post an ""in progress"" review, but am just now getting around to it. At this point, I'm 516 pages in, and am enjoying this book just fine. We'll see how the second half goes. It would be accurate to state that ADWD does not appear to be paced like a graphic novel or anything like one - if you want that kind of thing, you should pursue a graphic novel. It would also be accurate to say that the amount of detail GRRM layers his writing with creates a richer, more immersive reading experience (for me, anyway). He's obviously building up to something, and I'm still interested in seeing what that is. For me, though, the pleasure is in the journey as much as it is in what may be waiting at the end of it. There definitely are a lot of separate threads to keep track of, and I'm not sure how far any single plot-line can be advanced until the author starts weaving them together, as he's sure to do, eventually. In the meantime, I'm enjoying the trip. Also, if it's been a while since you read the previous books, you might want to read through them again (or at least the one immediately preceding ADWD) before embarking on No. 5. Bottom line is, half-way through and it's a reasonably satisfying read. Have I experienced any hair-yanking plot twists or cliffhangers that make me want to scratch out my own eyes? Not yet, and if there aren't any, so be it. It is what it is. Will update as appropriate. Enjoy. Part 2: Completed (11/26/11) I finished ADWD last night, and thinking about it this morning, I feel comfortable with a four-star assessment (according to Amazon, 4 stars = ""I like it,"" mid-way between ""It's OK"" and ""I love it""). That is a totally subjective opinion, and has no bearing on those who loved the book or those that couldn't stand it. I enjoyed it - it's as simple as that. Having read many reviews before purchasing this book, I'd like to respond to some of the more common critical themes I observed on the boards. I agree with many of the reviewers that, particularly compared with the first three books, there are not a whole lot of ""Whoa!"" moments in the first half of ADWD, though there are some significant developments in the second half. Many have stated that they perceive the book to be slow, and I can understand why some would feel that way given the number of different character points-of-view in ADWD and the manner in which they shift, chapter by chapter. Would I have enjoyed more focus on certain characters and less on others? Absolutely - but please don't take that to mean that I was ever bored with what I was reading. This book had the feel of a lengthy middle passage, sure enough, but one sailed under kindly skies. Another item that seems to be frequently mentioned is that the author spends an inordinate amount of time discussing food, clothing, and other mundane details. GRRM does spend a few sentences here and there describing what people may be having for breakfast, or what they may be dining on at a feast, or what they may be wearing. I don't recall any necessarily superfluous discussions of food or clothing, however - certainly nothing out of line with what's been described in the previous four books or in virtually every other book I've ever read, and occasionally just as interesting to read about. If memory serves, more time was spent on ""food"" in Caleb Carr's Lazlo Kreitzer books (the private dinners at Delmonico's and the like), or in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series (see ""drowned baby,"" or ""lobscouse""). There was one paragraph wherein GRRM described the heraldic devices on display at Castle Black, but it didn't seem to be an excessively long paragraph, by any measure - certainly in the context of a book nearly a thousand pages long. Plus appendices. Like anything else, though, these things are interpreted subjectively. The author has also been criticized for bringing no resolution to the tale as a whole and for ending ADWD itself with too many cliffhangers. Given the number of years between books and GRRM's widely varied foci, reader anxiety is totally understandable, and I'd likely feel much more strongly about this issue if I'd started reading the series during the 90s instead of starting in 2009 - I've been able to go from books 1-5 (intermittently) w/out having to endlessly wait for the next installment. In terms of ADWD, I did find that there was appreciable development among most of the primary storylines in this installment. Without giving anything away, it's safe to say that Tyrion, Jon, Theon, and Daenerys are in places very different from where they started ADDWD, though it's true that we have no way of knowing how, when, or if these storylines will resume. Arya, Bran, Jaime, and Cersei also make appearances, though not as frequently as some might wish (frankly, I'd be thrilled with a whole book focused exclusively on Patchface, oh, oh, oh). Quite a few readers have suggested that they won't continue with the series (or that those who have not yet started the series shouldn't do so) until it's definitively concluded, and that's a decision each reader will have to make. I think everyone hopes it won't be too long of a wait until book six comes out. [A side note on ""comments"" about reader reviews: I have noticed that there seems to be a LOT of disdain out there toward positive reviews (and reviewers) of this book - not simple disagreement - bitter disdain. People are almost militant about why you MUST NOT enjoy this book. I can't understand why people would choose to argue with someone about their totally subjective opinion of a book, and I've not observed this level of disparagement toward differing opinions outside the realm of political discourse. I'd be interested in knowing what makes ADWD so different from other books in that regard.] I'll wrap-up by saying that I'd recommend ADWD to those who have enjoyed the previous books in the series, but they should read the reviews (with a critical eye) in order to know what one might expect out of the experience. After all is said and done, though: it's a book, not a way of life.","2011-11-23","United States","","true","13","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YB1YI16SDO3R"
"B003YL4LYI","1","Feast for Crows, part 2 of 3 ! Ice & Fire, part 5 of 12?","I am trying to be fair, and I will not deny that this book had for me some elements of interest. I read all 5 volumes in quick succession, and I still feel semi-invested. But I am honestly not sure this volume (or even the series as a whole) deserves even the 2 stars I am tempted to give it. GRRM has sucked me in, but he also makes me feel like a sucker. And having read it, I would now give 10:1 odds that the series will never be completed. This latest volume alone contains 959 hardback pages; over 400,000 words; close to matching in length all 3 volumes of Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS. How could a book this long contain so little in the way of plot progression? Is the author stalling on purpose, or is this the only way he can cope with some weird kind of writer's block? Part of the problem was that George RR Martin, whatever his talent for piquing the readers interest and keeping him turning pages, was never that efficient a writer. He often uses 10 words to say would could be better said in 5. Even the early volumes could, in my opinion, be trimmed down significantly and be the better for it (in particular, I could have without the voyeuristic sex stuff, constant whore references, etc.). But the level of inefficiency and bloat has increased with each volume, reaching new heights with the last two. The other part of the problem is the proliferation of characters and points of view (""POVs""): 1. Game of Thrones: 9 povs 2. Clash of Kings: 10 povs 3. Storm of Swords: 12 povs 4. Feast for Crows: 13 povs 5. Dance with Dragons: 18 povs 4/5. Feast/Dance combined: 25 povs If you consider that FEAST and DANCE are supposed to be ""the same book"" divided by POV, then you can see that the number of POVs suddenly doubled after STORM. No wonder the story suddenly became unmanageable for the author. If one divides ones story between twice as many different characters in twice as many different locations, then the story can only progress half as fast. And if your chapters contain twice as much bloat (as seems to have happened), the your story can only progress one quarter as fast. And then the author starts repeating himself, perhaps because he fears you have not seen So-and-So in so long that you have forgotten what happened last time. More bloat. A third aspect of the problem is this: In the first volume, not only were there only 9 povs, but they were mostly gathered in the same place and time and able to help a single storyline forward. GAME OF THRONES started most of the main POVs together, such that there were initially 2 main threads, which then divided into 3 main threads. Only at the end of the volume were the 7 surviving POVs completely scattered to the winds. Then did the author require 2 more (larger) volumes to complete the same level of plot progression that the first volume had. And yet many fans remained patient and even enthusiastic. Then it got worse ... By the end of DANCE, we still have about 20 surviving POVs, and they are all still all scattered. One would think that the author would recognize this problem created by this vast scope, and adjust his writing style accordingly. But no. He thinks he has the time to describe how it feels for a character to urinate, and then describe a conversation he has with another character about how good he is is at urinating. Will his urinations skills have future plot relevance? He thinks he has the time to spend an entire paragraph describing a humble boat whose sole plot function is to transport a minor character from point A to point B (and leave him there), and then the author wastes another paragraph on how this minor character could have arrived on a nicer boat had things been different. George, you could have saved half a page, there. There are COUNTLESS such examples. Each chapter needs to have its length cut in half AT LEAST. So where are we now? How close is he to finished. THRONES was originally sold as the first of a ""trilogy"" (though the author admits he already knew better at publicaton). But his ""trilogy"" plan had originally been as follows: Part 1: Game of Thrones: Covering War of 5 Kings. Part 2: Dance of Dragons: Dany invades Westeros Part 3: Winds of Winter Well, he ended up needing a full 3 volumes to complete part 1. Part 2 was supposed to resume the story 5 years later, but for whatever reason, the author decided to scrap this plan and write an interim volume called ""FEAST FOR CROWS"". Let's call this Part 1.5. Well, as you recall, FEAST ended up becoming so bloated that it had to be split in two volumes, the second half being what is now being released as ""A Dance with Dragons."" But the bad news is, this unplanned Part 1.5 is not even finished. All the threads that were set up in FEAST and DANCE to converge on Meereen have not reached there yet, as this latest closes. Hey, remember that guy Victarion with the dragon horn who set off for Meereen at the beginning of FEAST FOR CROWS. Well, he is still at sea. BUT HE'S GETTING CLOSE!!! When will Dany finally land in Westeros? At this rate, it won't be until volume 7, because she will need all of Volume 6 to resolve the impending climax in Meereen. So here is a release schedule, with my estimated projections into the future, giving George 5 years to complete each future volume: Part I, Vol 1 (A Game of Thrones): 1996 Part I, Vol 2 (A Clash of Kings): 1998 Part I, Vol 3 (A Storm of Swords): 2000 Part 1.5, Vol 1 (A Feast for Crows): 2005 Part 1.5, Vol 2 (A Dance with Dragons): 2011 Part 1.5, Vol 3 ... 2016 (Climax in Meereen) Part 2, Vol 1 .... 2021 Dany reaches Westeros) Part 2, Vol 2 .... 2026 Part 2, Vol 3 .... 2031 Part 3, Vol 1 .... 2036 Part 3, Vol 2 .... 2041 Part 3, Vol 3 .... 2046 GRRM still says he hopes to finish the series in seven volumes. But if that were so, those who believed that promise had a right to expect better story progress in this volume. He should just be honest and say that he hopes to complete the series in 12 volumes and that he also hopes to live to be 120 in excellent health (don't we all). That way, potential readers could make an informed decision as to whether they should invest time and money in this story. But I cannot see it at his current rate. This story will not be resolved, and readers who hope for a resolution are wasting their time with it. That's how I am calling it. George, you are welcome to prove me wrong.","2011-07-28","United States","","true","14","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1T1165DJ9OBLO"
"B003YL4LYI","3","Not on the Same Level as the First Books... (SPOILER ALERT)","This book fell well short of expectations. A Game of Thrones is my favorite book (not the series, just the book) because it is written so realistically with great characters with vibrant personalities whose actions made sense within the context of those personalities. Eddard dies because of his honor, Robert dies not caring about governing but hunting for a boar, Sansa lies for Joffery because she is a naive little girl, etc. The characters are real, with real strengths and flaws. Almost all the major players/characters are introduced in the beginning, what with the feast at Winterfell for Robert and then on the way to King's Landing. We got to see all the characters together, so even when they diverge we are bound to their stories by where they came from, by common ground. Enough major events happen to keep us hooked: Bran being thrown by Jamie, Catelyn capturing Tyrion at swordpoint, Eddard being attacked by Jamie, etc. I could go on and on. All the stories were tied together by a common purpose: Westeros. Eddard and the other POV's were about Lannisters trying to control the realm, John Snow's was about defending the realm from the Others, and Daenerys was about regaining the realm. Everything is about the realm. The realm is the most important thing that ties everything together. We care about the realm. A Game of Thrones was tightly written. I do not consider a fantasy book, but a book on political intrigue with a gorgeous backstory (Robert's rebellion) in a fantasy setting. There wasn't overt use of magical powers or mystical creatures. Everything was written in a plausible, easy-to-relate to way in the context of political intrigue that could have happened in medieval Europe. The Others and the Dragons and the witchcraft of the woman who killed Dany's child Rhaego were done tastefully. The overall story and plot and characters carried the book, not the fantasy/magical parts of it. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't dislike fantasy obviously, but everything has changed with Dance. With the way the series has progressed, the fantasy is used way too much. There are so many things to keep track of, so many powers and magical artifacts. The Horn of Winter, Euron's Dragon Hellhorn, the Greenseers, the Weirwoods, Warging, Green Dreams, Dragonglass killing the Others, weird wizards in Qarth and the Undying, Lightbringer and AA, burning and seeing things in the fire from R'Hollar, etc. This is all well and fine, but it completely changes the rules. Basically in Game of Thrones, we are limited to what men can accomplish. Those were the rules of the game of thrones. Now, all those rules are thrown out of whack because we have all these new mechanics. A lot of these things have just been mentioned, not necessarily used, but I feel they take away from the character interaction aspects of the story in Game of Thrones. It would have been better to keep the series somewhat within the normal limits of what medieval men could do but then add a bit of fantasy to lean on. The only thing that should have been a trump card the whole time (due to Targaryen precedent) is the dragons, and they haven't even been used yet. The veering towards more overt fantasy and getting away from the core political intrigue might just be my personal dislike, which is fine. What is not fine, however, and something that many people have already brought up, is the entire lack of coherent plot. I mentioned before that A Game of Thrones was all about the realm. It gave us a single cohesive thing that we care about. Everything flowed and made sense and came back to this central aspect. There was a sequence of events that we clearly saw. For example, Catelyn goes down to King's Landing because she gets the dagger. Littlefinger convinces her it was Tyrion's. Catelyn captures Tyrion. In return, Jamie attacks and wounds Eddard. This is shone through several different character's POV's and flows. Obviously this is one story arc, but so much happens. In Dance, we have the Meereenese story arc. Nothing flows at all. The characters involved are Connington and co, Tyrion, Dany, Barristan, and Quentyn. Connington and co just separate, abandoning Meereen completely. Tyrion goes on his massive adventure of ultimately doing nothing and making it to Meereen as a dwarf entertainer jousting slave who never even meets Dany. I realize he picks up Jorah Mormont and gains perspective from Penny, but seriously this should not take this long. Does Penny actually serve a purpose? Quentyn goes on his own journey, reaches Meereen, and essentially does completely nothing. There is no interesting dialogue between him and Dany or anyone else really, and the only thing he does is free the two dragons. Dany's POV's are basically her being too nice/naïve/little lustful girl and failing as a ruler. All of them. I felt they were extremely repetitive and worse, destroyed the ""great characters with vibrant personalities whose actions made sense within the context of those personalities"" aspect of the series. How does she turn into a complete wise-beyond-her-years badass with the strength to lead a broken khalasar who frees Unsullied to a super lustful teenage girl? I don't buy the regression. You can say she's just a girl, she's Sansa with dragons, but that's not true. She was so much stronger and decisive and commanding and she suddenly self-implodes while not moving the plot along whatsoever? Come on. The problem is the events in this story arc don't overlap. You could read one characters POV through and essentially just get their own story. Contrast that with my examples from A Game of Thrones, where each different character's POV built upon each other and moved the story along. Overall, in Dance, there are many things that do not fit and do not tie together cohesively. You randomly get Jamie's chapter with a Brienne cameo, which was awesome, but then nothing happens. You random get a chapter with Aero Hotah to see a glimpse of Doran Martell, which was again awesome, but then nothing happens. These are tremendously written chapters, but what is the point of having them here and then making no mention of them until the next book five years down the line? Arya's chapters are the same thing. These chapters seem like cameos (and are some of my favorites) to let fans read about the characters without actually doing a single thing to progress the plot. There is so much happening everywhere and nothing is related. All of a sudden, I go read about Arya in Braavos to Quentyn on the way to Meereen to Jon on the wall to Jaime in the Riverlands. Nothing ties together or works together the way it did in Game of Thrones. Many characters have tremendously different goals then the realm, which is the thing that tied everything together in the first book. Now we have Dany sitting in Meereen for basically no discernible reason, and many readers have spoken out, ""we don't care about Essos."" You can't start out a series with a focus on the throne in Westeros and then spend such significant time in Essos but accomplish absolutely nothing there. I feel like the series has gotten far away from the tightly woven narrative structure that was so fascinating to read from so many different characters' POV's. Now, we have even more and different characters' POV's, but they each tell different stories that are not inter-woven and are unfocused. It makes it hard to get through when nothing relates to anything else. The book's saving grace is the Northern storyline told mainly through Davos and Theon, with a little bit of Jon. I am not surprised at all these are many people's favorite chapters; it is because they follow the same formula as A Game of Thrones. Davos is ""killed"" by Manderly, but he is not and instead must go to Skagos. Huge awesome event that moves the plot. At the same time, we learn that Manderly is still very much committed to the Starks and hates the Freys and Boltons. This information is crucial to reading the later Theon chapters, since we now know exactly where Manderly's loyalties lie. Likewise, Jon sends Mance to Winterfell, and we meet Abel and his spearwives. The banker from the Iron Bank helps Jon, and then is crucial to saving Asha's men and bringing Theon and fake Arya to Stannis. One thing in one character's POV comes up again in the others, giving the story arc continuity and logical flow. This does not happen in the other story arcs, which are essentially just filler. I was honestly bored reading some of it, and that is something I would never have expected in reading this series. I will, of course, be buying and reading every book with just as much fervor as they come out. I hope, however, that the series goes back to the excellent narrative and pacing it began with in A Game of Thrones rather than the (admittedly still good) product we got in Dance.","2011-07-19","United States","","true","15","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIBUXQAGAKA92"
"B003YL4LYI","2","A few juicy moments drowned in gruel","Warning, there are spoilers below. I really wanted to enjoy dance, bad. As upset as i was with the 5 year wait to get the second half of a mediocre book...i was really willing to give it a chance. I bought it the second it came out, brought my kindle with me everywhere so i could read it in my down time - paid close attention and picked up on little subtle things others might have missed - all this, and i was still disappointed. (not in the Kindle tho, this thing is awesome, and no I'm not getting paid to say this. It's perfect for someone who travels a lot for work). It really boils down to this - it doesn't feel like Martin enjoys writing about this world anymore. His behavior reinforces this feeling, too. It's like he's just bored of this world and has lost that energetic spark to create. Reading the first three books, it was like a man excited about the world he was building, excited about the stories, the characters, excited about what he was going to DO with them and he wanted to get there as smoothly and quickly as possible. Remember when Catelyn left for King's Landing in one chapter, and then arrived there next chapter? It's because the journey was unimportant - that stuff was filler - what happened to her IN King's Landing was important. Reading the last two, it was like he wasn't really sure what to do anymore, he couldn't figure out where he was going, he just had to fill up the pages with something, and he kept thinking back and forth on what to write. adding, deleting, adding, deleting - this is a worrisome sign when indecision, apathy, and indifference about a tale begin to rear their ugly head. It's this energetic drive when you have a story you want to tell. But I didn't get that here from Martin, which is disappointing, because the man has genuine talent. He just doesn't seem to be inspired enough to use it. I never got the impression of a clear vision. I didn't get a sense of his excitement for these characters. It shows up in a lot of ways - the tired cliches, the empty characterizations of the main viewpoints - it feels like Dance was a homework assignment to him, a very unwelcome homework assignment. ""This one was a three bitches and a bastard"", indeed it was, and that feeling comes across in his writing style. I really just feel he's bored and out of ideas. He's tired of Westeros, he isn't sure what to do anymore, and he's just stringing things along with random WTF moments thrown in to try and maintain our interest and fake excitement. It's similar to sudden loud sounds or 'GOTCHA' moments in bad scary movies; using cheap tricks to try and evoke a sense of fear when the plot itself can't. There are only a few moments where I get a sense of the old Martin. Reading Theon's chapters were interesting. Theon actually had an arc, an evolution, and you got the sense that George enjoyed telling this story. Too bad he had to ruin it with yet another cliffhanger ending. In fact, this was one of the few true cliffhangers in the book, in my opinion. The other 'cliffhangers' were never set up properly and are more like 'dangling threads' that came out of nowhere. We have Jon getting the Caesar treatment, Stannis marching on Winterfell, Theon and Jeyne escaping, Aegon landing in Westeros, the situation on the Wall, the Pink Letter... Too much buildup here with too little payoff! And then one of the big cliffhanger moments from the first book - Brienne - gets barely a mention in this! We are left to deduce what she most likely said and her agreement to lead Jaime to UnCat in return for her life - yet another plotline that goes nowhere. At the end of the book, effectively, nothing big or major has happened that we can see the result of. Dany is basically back where she started, realizing she should have gone to Westeros. The entire sideshow in Meereen has effectively accomplished nothing. A lot of interesting things happen to the characters that are ultimately irrelevant. The Others are still persona non grata, mentioned only in shadows. Dragons still haven't returned. Stannis hasn't really conquered anything meaningful. Tommen is still king. Dorne is still 'progressing'. The Ironborn are still the same. Not enough major action has happened. I can accept one book of mostly filler, but two? A Dance with Dragons feels like it was written to meet a word count! What's next, he goes through and increases the font size on all the periods to add some more volume? He might as well, it'd be just as entertaining. The problem is, Martin could have easily given us at least one big climax in this book. You could have given us a Meereen showdown with results, you could have given us Jon's ""death"" and obvious rebirth as Azhor Az'hai or whatever, you could have given us the Others finally attacking in force, you could have given us Victarion or Tyrion meeting Dany, you could have given us the battle of Winterfell and the results - there are so many things he could have done that we don't get to see. He could have given us the first use of Dragons in war, and that would have fit right in the with the title. I don't mind cliffhangers, but really we should have gotten SOMETHING resolved in this book so it doesn't feel like a giant tease. The few redeeming moments for me - Selmy, Wyman's awesomeness (""So young"" said Wyman Manderly. ""Though mayhaps this was a blessing. Had he lived, he would have grown up to be a Frey.""), ""Would you like Freys with that"", Theon - simply don't add enough to justify book for me. If you enjoy reading detailed prose, and seeing a world being built by a very skilled author, you might enjoy this. If you're a huge fan of everything remotely to do with the world Martin has skillfully created, then you will find a lot here to fill in the blanks. Unfortunately, most of those blanks were blank for a reason - we just didn't care. I still don't. If you're a fan of an engaging, interesting plot - the sort of plot that we saw in the first three books - I'd give it a pass. PS: Martin may denounce us here at Amazon as trolls and sockpuppets, but I think that makes a mockery of the good rating system that has made Amazon so useful for people like me in the past. Mr. Martin, if you read this, please make note of the 'verified purchaser' next to this review.

"B003YL4LYI","4","Martin's writing has changed... but I still like it","The first three books in this series were fast-paced, with lots of huge, game-changing events per book, and that was part of the draw for me. A Feast for Crows and, now, A Dance With Dragons, aren't like that; they're slower, more contemplative, more thematically-driven rather than plot-driven. It's certainly a change, and I was initially a bit disappointed. But ultimately, I really liked A Dance With Dragons (and I ranked AFFC at 3.5). There isn't as much plot momentum here as in previous books, and at times I found that frustrating (although it helped to know about it going in). But I never found the book less than compelling; the character development is solid, the worldbuilding excellent, the writing good and the thematics strong, and enough happened to keep me interested. I enjoyed visiting new places on Martin's map and the immersive descriptions; it's as if I actually visited many of these places, something I value highly in any book. And I really enjoyed the look at the realities of leadership, seeing the characters grow and change, and gradually learning more about some of the backstory mysteries. It makes the most sense to discuss this book in terms of specific storylines, so I'll break it down (no spoilers!): DAENERYS: Unlike many readers, I found her chapters to be among the most interesting in the book. Previously she's done a lot of traveling, and it was cool to see her actually ruling here. The conflict between her values and principles and the realities of her situation was fascinating. A lot of people have been frustrated with her relationship with Daario, but despite his manifest unattractiveness I liked that too; Dany's at the age where this often happens, and how many fantasy heroines are allowed to have a fling? Also, this storyline let Martin flesh out Meereen more than he'd previously done with anyplace outside Westeros; in previous books I found Dany's ""eastern"" surroundings somewhat two-dimensional, but while the local characters still aren't as vivid as the Westerosi, here he goes a long way toward closing that gap. JON: Paralleling Dany's storyline, we see him trying to rule and the myriad difficulties he faces. Both he and Dany are faced with hard decisions and break new ground trying to do what they see as right, which didn't fail to keep my interest. Ends on a ridiculous cliffhanger--but while I've never liked Martin's ending books this way, he's done it since the beginning and I've gotten used to it. TYRION: His arc resembles Arya's in A Clash of Kings; he spends the book journeying toward a specific destination (Daenerys, in his case), and along the way he meets interesting people, develops as a character and faces a lot of personal reversals and changes of fortune.... without reaching his destination. I was a bit frustrated by this in both books (it's hard not to be). But there's a lot there, and it's interesting to see Tyrion try to make it without being able to call on the Lannister name or the wealth of Casterly Rock every time things go sour. THEON/REEK: Martin likes to challenge your opinion of a character. I didn't like this arc as much as many others; Ramsay is so two-dimensionally sociopathic and evil that it was hard to summon up any feelings toward him, and having hated Theon in previous books, I wonder if being victimized has really improved him. The jury's still out on that. ARYA, BRAN, DAVOS, JAIME, CERSEI: Only get a couple chapters each, although they're interesting. This book is certainly sprawling; there are so many characters in so many different places that it just isn't as unified as, say, A Game of Thrones. QUENTYN: Has an interesting storyline and a complete arc. He himself is rather dull, but he was intended to be. A thoughtful examination of the forces at work on somebody in his position. SELMY: Meh, kind of a less interesting copy of Eddard Stark. He's more another pair of eyes on Meereen than an important character in his own right. ASHA: Not many chapters, but hard-hitting and atmospheric. We get a taste of Westeros winter here, and it's a scary thing. Also, Asha herself is awesome. VICTARION: Also doesn't reach his destination, but there are some fascinating things going on in his chapters. I still hope somebody stabs him though. ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE: Yes, there are more. It's a big book. The downside is that when a chapter ends, we often have to go 100 pages or more before seeing that character again; the upside, that there's a lot going on. Ultimately, a lot of this book is setup, and I'm not thrilled with that; when most of the best books of all time are significantly shorter than this, does Martin really need nearly 1000 pages for setups and transition? It's easy for fantasy series to become self-indulgent, and here a couple arcs seem to have their climaxes deferred; others simply don't go where I thought they would, and that's fine. It's not a perfect book, aside from that--there are some important secondary characters who aren't very vividly drawn (especially true in Dany's chapters), but then there are great bit-part characters of the sort I've come to expect from Martin. I have some reservations about his treatment of gender issues--for the most part he does all right, and at least he's thinking about it, but at times he falls flat because he's just so entrenched in the male gaze. Despite all that, I enjoyed the two weeks or so I spent with this book. It's a well-written, intelligent novel, and enough twists and turns are thrown at the reader to keep me satisfied. None of the characters are the same as they were at the beginning of this book, nor are their storylines. A solid four stars.","2011-07-30","United States","","true","17","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R317D6ZCAWMUJ8"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Books should not be judged by how long the wait for them is...","A lot of the reviews that have been negative so far for Dance talk about how ""the wait wasn't worth it"". But the thing is, for the most part these reviews only harp on the fact that ""oh, I've waited six years for Martin to finally finish it, but there's no epic battles/resolution/revelations"" etcetera and ""I waited so long for THIS? Oh man I'm done with the series"" blah blah blah. They don't actually talk about the story itself. And while I'm as critical of Martin for how absurdly long he makes his loyal readers wait between installments--especially since the argument could be made that a part of that wait is spent by him not spending as much time on writing as fans think he should--this isn't the place for those arguments. A book should be judged by its contents, not how long a reader waited for it. These people, while not completely unjustified in a lot of the criticisms they're raising--especially in the abundance of cliff hangers and open-ended storylines-- are missing the point of what, in my mind, makes A Song of Ice and Fire great--the characters, the unpredictable nature of where the plot's going to go, the wonderful world of Westeros and its environs, but again, most of all, the characters! Dance is much more about character development than other books in Martin's series, especially compared to Storm of Swords, in which almost every chapter involved some great action scene, or development, or advancement of the plot in some way. The pace here is more like that of Clash of Kings--and much better, not just barely better than Feast, which I think most will agree is the most slow-paced novel in the series. While it lacked epic scenes equivalent to the Battle of Blackwater, the wildlings' attack on the wall, or the Red Wedding, there's still plenty of solid content that should satiate most fans of the series, particularly the introduction of a storyline/group of characters that pretty much changes everything, and one cliffhanger for a certain character that I had to reread again, it was so exciting and unexpected. Again, its the characterization and not the war or overarching storyline that's the star of the show here. The POVs are essentially divided into three groups: those in the North and around the Wall reacting to the events of Mance Rayder's failed attack on the wall and Roose Bolton's rise to Warden of the North; Dany as she attempts to establish her role as Meereen's monarch and the various suitors and others attempting to reach her and her dragons; and a smattering of returning POVs from Feast for Crows which, while not completely resolving loose ends from the previous novel, do just enough to tie up those loose ends but leave the reader intrigued as to what happens next. The three main POVs are easily the most slowly paced, but they also have, in my mind, some of the best character development in the series. Jon is struggling to remain neutral in Stannis' efforts to win the north, while at the same time asserting himself as a strong commander. Tyrion has decided to embrace the image of the evil imp everyone else had wrongly made him out to be while trying to decide what to do with his life. And Dany makes decisions in her ruling of Meereen that may or not go against the destiny meant for her. I enjoyed the other POVs more than I did the main ones, but really, all of them, set the stage for what will hopefully be a brilliant next installment...whenever that may be. The new POVs (there are four--two are brand new characters and two are former periphery characters)are more or less welcome additions to the story, especially one of the new ones. Finally, Dance easily has the best one-shot POV (meaning prologue or epilogue) of the series so far. And the book isn't just nothing happening until the end as some are making it out to be--there is a HUGE revelation early on(not to mention another towards the end careless readers will miss), and one of the main POVs comes out of the gate really strong in a moment that had me cheering when I read it. No, it isn't perfect. But Martin can't make every installment of the series Storm of Swords or of its same exact caliber. Complaints for me include, that while cliffhangers aren't necessarily a bad thing, and some of them are excellent in this, others just left me going ""really? That's all we get?"" Martin definitely overuses his techniques of repeating phrases and describing food and fauna in a ton of detail. And while I enjoyed most of the POVs, I had a problem with two of the new ones--one only got one chapter, and the other, who was foreshadowed in the previous novel, just never became fully realized for me. But hey, at the end of the day, I got to be reunited with Jon, Dany, Tyrion, Bran, Davos, and other characters we haven't seen in years. And while there may not be a slambang, epic beheading, battle, or wedding people may have wanted as a reward for their long wait, there is still plenty of developments, and plenty of foreshadowing at things to come, that should leave most fans at least somewhat happy, or at the very least talking about and debating the events of Dance.","2011-07-15","United States","","true","18","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26NTL0LRK9PUC"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Totally Worth It!","Dance! I just finished it last night. If you just started? Don't stop! I wanted sooooo badly to skip ahead and get some hint of what was to come I had to force myself to slow down and take it one impatient step at a time. Isn't that just like Life Itself? I think the most valid comment/criticism I've heard so far that I can identify with is the fact that anyone following this Saga and patiently and loyally keeping up with it, is an extraordinary, intelligent reader who has stayed with the entire storyline and character additions, plots and sub-plots so much that we know it just as well, if not better than the writer! We don't need to be reminded of things, these books were not meant to be read singly, so please? Let's get ON with it! I'm as hungry as a Dragon and I need to be fed! I also know that I'm an extraordinarily impatient person and one of my life's lessons is to enjoy and savor what is in front of me today and allow the future to unfold as it will. Having said all that? I have also found over the last few years that re-reading has produced for me more ideas, plots and intrigue that I would have otherwise completely missed had I not been forced to go over it again and again for lack of new fodder. I really and truly appreciate that more than I can say, and interestingly enough? At the end of Dance, I already KNOW I rushed through it so fast I need to go back and marinade on everything again, lol. I meant to finish re-reading Feast before I allowed myself to start on Dance but I just didn't have the discipline, sorry. It was a real struggle, alright? The new book had just come in and I was ITCHING to get at it. I convinced myself that I remembered enough from Feast to get started, and then totally succumbed to the lust for MORE of Life in Westeros and beyond. (It was worth it, hee hee) I suspect that Feast and Dance will be the lull before the final Storm. I'm hoping that it will end up as ""Seven"" books altogether, that would be fitting don't you think? He needs to regain some momentum with the final books and put us all out of our collective misery of wanting more (and needing some resolution) with no doubt some sort of profound cliffhanger leaving us certain that Westeros will forever be a part of our lives. He's done such a good job of making this so much like life itself, forever uncertain, and timeless in every way possible. But even Martin has said that; ""Death comes to us all,"" so somehow he needs to bring a death to this, while also adding that magical layer of immortality we know to be the human experience when we look at our collective history and also into our children's eyes at the same time. I can't help but think he had to rush things (sorta) to get Dance out right after HBO Thrones, the timing is too perfect to think otherwise; but I'm so happy with the HBO series I can't really bitch too much. Maybe he will feel content enough to allow the HBO series to continue while he settles down to finish writing the rest of the thing, but I suspect it will all be about timing after this. He ""needs must"" finish the next book in time to be presentable after the 5th season of HBO is complete. And they can always make Feast into at least two seasons, or stretch any part of the Saga they want actually. So, here's my best guess. They'll make two more seasons on HBO with the next two books, start on the 4th Season with Feast (while he finishes up the 6th book) perhaps turn Feast into two seasons while they prepare HBO for Dance, and we won't see anything new for at LEAST 5 more years? We will all fall in love with the HBO version and hover around our televisions or laptops, watching and re-watching like the addicts we are. If George is kind to us? He will give us scraps of the future from time to time, and maybe even turn that into a new ploy of possibilities, just like a Priest of R'hllor tempting us by reading the future in the flames? Whetting our appetite with different versions of what may come? That would actually be pretty cool. Maybe I'll write him and suggest that, lol. In the meantime? I'm going back to Feast to catch myself up some more, and then earnestly going to try to sort out the whole Yunkai, Astapor, Meereen political mess. If I read another Hzzz something name without understanding who the hell it is? I'm going to shoot myself. Without telling you anymore? At this point my best advice is to go to the end of the book and sort out who is WHO among all the players in the Free Cities before you do anything else! Altogether? Great series, I'm hooked and this book hasn't stopped me from wanting more, not at all.","2011-07-21","United States","","true","19","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10GXRB0SQUBXG"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Long, Slower Paced, But Enjoyable","I just finished reading this book (on my Kindle) and I enjoyed it. I read a fair number of the other reviews here before purchasing it, many negative, leading to some trepidation, but in the end I was not disappointed. Whether this is because my expectations had already been lowered, or because I am a less critical reader than others, or because the book is actually not as bad as its critics have claimed, is open to debate. I want to address the most common complaints of those other reviews, namely that the book is just filler material, nothing happens, no plot points are resolved, etc. The author states quite clearly in the preface to the previous book and this one, that the events of the two books (the 4th and 5th in the series) take place in parallel. He had too much material for one book, and instead of splitting that material chronologically, making two books each covering a shorter time period, he chose to instead split the characters into two groups, concentrating on one group in the fourth book and another group in this book. I don't think that was a good idea, and the result speaks for itself (irritated fans), but what's done is done. If you read the fourth book right after it was published and then had to wait a long time for the fifth book to come out, the effect of that decision is more pronounced. But now that both books are out, if you read this book while the previous one is still fresh in your mind, it is not as jarring. The book is long, and some parts seem long-winded. Perhaps an editor should have taken a knife to it and trimmed a few sections. I mean, I an not really interested in every course that was served at a feast, the coat-of-arms of every man in a force, or the fate of every boat in a storm-tossed fleet. But the long-winded sections are not rampant. You are confronted with one occasionally. Considering the size of the book, if it had been trimmed by 20%, it would still have been plenty long enough in number of pages. If the author were being paid by the word (which I doubt), he'd still have made plenty of money. I don't find the idea credible that the author was deliberately padding out the novel. I suspect it is more a case of the publishers just trying to get the thing out the door. It's a damned-if-you-do and damned-if-you-don't situation. Another round of editing might have improved the book, but the fans might have had to wait another year to see it. Since the events of the fourth and fifth books transpire within the same time frame, then in the chronology of the book's universe, you cannot say that something happened in the fourth book, but nothing in the fifth book -- everything that happened in one, happened in the other (notwithstanding that the fifth book's time-frame extends beyond that of the fourth book). Even taken on its own, this book does advance the plot, and it does resolve some plot points. Bran's long journey to find the three-eyed raven has a resolution. As in all the previous books, not all the (remaining) major characters survive. Unless you were hoping for this to be the last book of the series, it obviously cannot resolve all the plot points. If it were the last book of the series, then some people would be moaning about that, trying to get their fixes by contributing their own (lame) fan fiction. If you're tiring of the series, and you just want the story to end so that you can close out your investment in it, then I guess you have a complaint. But if you like the series, and you want more, well, then you got what you wanted. The pace of the story slowed down starting with the fourth book, and the slower pace continues in this one, but you can still feel it building toward a conclusion. If one of the things you most loved about the series was its pace in books one through three, and you didn't like the slowdown in book four, then this book is just going to exasperate you the same way the previous one did. Although I did prefer the faster pace of the first three books as well, I still find the story compelling even when if it is now more drug out. You don't have to be a genius to predict that the result of Winter and the others coming down from the north, and a princess with dragons coming up from the south, is going to result in some cataclysmic battle, where the reintroduction of dragons into the world actually saves it, in spite of all the destruction they cause. I'm looking forward to it, just not as impatiently as some others. GRRM is going to have to get his a-- moving on the next book (or books) though. If the TV series, just finishing up the second season, goes through more or less a book per season, and the production for a given season needs to start about a year in advance of its broadcast, and the next book therefore has to be available to serve as a guide for the development scripts, then we've got about two years until the scriptwriters needs book six.","2012-06-07","United States","","true","20","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSZRFZPR0CZTB"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Dancing with dragons, very carefully","I am not including a spoilers warning at the head of this review as I have faith in the intelligence of readers who want to read this series in sequence. Who would read a fifth book in a series without previously reading its four predecessors? Anyone who happens to stumble on this review without investigating more closely that it is not the first book is taking a risk of 'spoiling' themselves. That's as much warning from me as you will get this time. The fifth book, like its predecessors, is nasty and brutal but the allusion to Thomas Hobbes cannot be complete because it is definitely not short. Most of the major characters that have survived since the first book still survive the end of this although the fate of one of them is questionable. They survive but not without being severely shaken and disturbed. Those characters remain unsettled and Martin has populated his world with dozens of other characters, tossing names out like plates in a juggling act and his brief physical descriptions don't add much beyond viewing them as merely population statistics in this vast world. If that last paragraph sounded overly harsh or conveyed the impression that I look on this book as a failure I want to correct that assumption. It's as readable as the other books although as with 'A Feast for Crows,' I have more of a vested interest in the fates of characters that I have spent time with in previous books than with characters that have never appeared before. Martin has wisely retained his favorite character, Tyrion Lannister, that witty survivor, although even Tyrion is finding it difficult to talk himself out of deadly situations. Heading east as a fugitive he is abducted by exiled, wandering knight Jorah Mormont who hopes to win back the favor of Daenerys by bringing Tyrion to her. He finally meets one of his own kind, another dwarf named Penny, a 'mummer' i.e. performer of tricks whose brother was mistaken for Tyrion and murdered. Although he cares for Penny she is not his physical type nor is she a whore so anyone expecting a sweet dwarf romance will be quickly disappointed. Tyrion, Penny and Jorah all get sold into slavery and Tyrion alone seems to be proactive in seeking ways to escape. His humor has not been beaten out of him but Tyrion definitely has a much harsher life as a slave than as a wily aristocrat. Jon Snow is now commander of the Night's Watch although his life has presented new struggles. The man who would be king Stannis arrived at the eleventh hour to ensure that the defenders of The Wall defeated the wildlings who had mounted an assault upon it. The Night's Watch historically takes no sides in power struggles. Their vows include protecting ALL men. However, Stannis, with the aid of his wife Selyse and red priestess Melisandre and some yes men advisors has assumed authority, placing Jon in a very delicate situation. Jon inducts hundreds of wildling prisoners into the Night's Watch, feeling that the Watch is strengthened by former foes that know the territory and surely can seek the logic of pooling efforts into fighting the common enemy, The Others, who remain mysterious, ominous foes lurking in the forests. Doing what he feels is best for the Watch but trying not to run afoul of Stannis' authority is a precarious balancing act. How well he performs that balance remains to be seen. Two of the other Stark children, Bran and Arya, have briefer escapades that lead them into stranger, more mysterious avenues. Bran finally finds the Three-Eyed Crow, not a crow but a skeletal figure known as the last greenseer, who instructs Bran in how to use his gift of prophesy and visioning through nature as well as skinchanging, entering the bodies of various animals. Arya undergoes a different kind of spiritual tutelage, continuing her initiation into the Faceless Men, an order of assassins that worships the Many-Faced God, a god of death. Across the seas, Daenerys is having even more difficulty controlling her dragons as well as her people. She has the foresight to cast aside her personal feeling (unlike the fatally romantic Robb Stark) and weds for political expediency rather than passion a noble of the city of Mereen. Needless to say, disaster ensues and Dany is fortunate not to have lost her life as well as everything else. And then there is always Cersei, who finally has two POV chapters. For those wanting to see justice served, she does suffer public humiliation after confessing her crimes before awaiting trial. Her fate also remains unresolved. In some ways, this book is feeding on itself, perpetuating new struggles for old characters. In this novel, the dragons aren't the only untamable creatures. All attempts to bring stability and order to the denizens of this world are equally futile. While this may contribute to the authenticity of this quasi-medieval world it doesn't appear to be inching the series any closer to a conclusion. I can understand readers who just want Martin to start wrapping up plotlines and tying loose threads although for now I'm still enjoying the ride and marveling in the fertility of this author's massive creation.","2014-11-24","United States","","true","21","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LE1FUK9R4FPB"
"B003YL4LYI","3","A Rocky Road to the Right Path","""Is it good?"" I got asked this by my brother who has only seen the show and saw me reading the newest book. Since obviously I couldn't discuss much with him, but he still wanted to know, as everyone else has been wanting to know: ""Is it good?"" Yes it's good. It's better than a Feast for Crows by virtue of it's characters alone. But wow, it's also incredibly frustrating. Sorry for the quick change of mood there, but that's exactly what it's like to read this book. Moments will make you snap to attention and instantly remember why you've waited so long for the series, and how you loved it in the first place. This book has the power to draw you away from your world and into its. But these are but brief illuminations in a dark and often blindly led journey. Dance's biggest problem is it's pacing, which is to say stop and go. Whenever you think something major is about to happen, the book seems intent at preventing it. And yet this is a gargantuan of a novel. What makes up the extra space in between actual happenings? Exposition and traveling. So much of what is spoken could have only been mentioned and still had the same effect. Take for instance every Victarion Greyjoy chapter. Are the iron born interesting? Yes they are and very much so. Is there any amount of information in his chapters that couldn't have been neatly condensed into one? No. This becomes a problem later on when things should be picking up but never seem to. There is hardly a character in this book that doesn't seemingly have their story end one chapter (or more) too short. And not in the ""I must know what happens next"" way, but rather in the ""I fear this may be another six year cliffhanger"" manner. Then there is the almost laughable cases of Bran and Davos. I swear to the seven that I flipped back through the book just to make sure that I didn't somehow miss more of their chapters. Let me save you the time. You didn't The other major problem is actually some of the characters themselves. Yes, they are much better than the ones we got in Feast for Crows, but only barely. The biggest offender is no other than Tyrion himself. His story is long, mildly eventful, sometimes utterly bizarre (in ways good and bad), but worst of all (and I can't believe I'm writing this) it's humorless. A chuckle here and there maybe, but for the most part Martin loses his way with Tyrion's dialogue. Danerys sadly fairs much the same. She (and Tyrion for that matter) has some INCREDIBLE moments in this book, but for the most part she spends her time spinning her wheels and kicking up mud all around here the whole time. Yet again, it's all in an effort to end the story in an interesting place and then take what may happen away for another day. Which leads us to Jon Snow. The strongest of the three major characters, Jon's story sees him discovering leadership as well as himself as a person. It's a good story with some great little moments, and even in its' drawn out passages it still seems the most driven. Yet it ends with not only a cliffhanger for his own situation, but the ones of others as well who don't get their own final chapters. There's also a problem with new additions. I'll be brief. Tyrion meets an uninteresting dwarf woman who gets much dialogue and time, Danerys is practically surrounded by a cast of ""who?""s that you get to know and become ""who cares""?, many sell sword companies are introduced out of the blue and now have quite a bit of sway. None of those compare to the holy mother of ""huh?"" characters however. For the sake of extreme spoilers I will not mention the name, but the character comes right out of the blue and can completely change everything that has been done so far. I hope there is a satisfying reasoning to this...surprise and it wasn't just done to give us a mini-me version of a well dead character we could never have, but I fear the later. Yet I give this book 3 stars, and I say it is good. That's because it is. For instance take the surprising quality of the Reek chapters. By now, I'm going to assume it's no major spoiler to say that Reek is Theon Greyjoy. It might be a spoiler however to let you know that his chapters might be the best in the book. They are purposeful, deliberate, and constantly interesting. They also introduce us to some fantastic new villains in the Boltons, and just for hell he becomes a rallying point of sorts for other major characters. In Theon's story you will find that old magic once again that the first three books had in spades. He's not the only one. Davos and Bran may be cut short, but what's there is great. The activities of King Stannis and those around him are always interesting and make for some of the best intrigue in the book. Asha Greyjoy has a short but sweet story that puts her in an active position within the overall story. Ser Barristan Selmy has a few very, very good chapters. And while I still find Tyrion's chapters to be boring, Jon and Danerys overall provide the major plots of this tale, and both contribute enough to make it worth while. The best characters though? The precious few chapters we get from the Feast for Crows gang. Not only do they advance the unresolved plots of Jamie, Cersei, and No One, but they are also some of the best written of the bunch further suggesting that Martin knows where he going with the plot, but that he needed these last two books to turn a real big ship around to get there. Then there are those moments. In fact I retract my earlier statement. It's not the characters that make this better than a Feast for Crows, it's those damn moments. This installment spreads them around more liberally than its' predecessor did, and is the much better for it. This book feels more alive than A Feast for Crows, even when it's just shuffling it's feet. Plus like I said, it may take a while to get there but by the end of this book the whole overall plot feels much more on track and focused. Oh and that last chapter? Gravy. Pure indulgence and a fantastic bookend to both fully hype you for book six and remind you the power Martin still wields with a pen over your very soul and even your expectations. Ultimately I may have fallen under the same curse as Martin and spoke too many words. Because you will read this book and you very much should. Ultimately some will say that the wait was too long for too much unresolved. Maybe that's true. But as a whole and judged on it's own this is a more than solid entry into the Ice and Fire series and, while not destined to become everyone's favorite, is still a hard work of fiction to out right hate. But George, can I sum up quickly what fans want for Winds of Winter? More Dragons, Less Dancing.","2011-07-22","United States","","true","22","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OB2Y526SHB2M"
"B003YL4LYI","4","A Trip to the Great Meereenese Cul-de-Sac","Do I even need to say how long it's been? A Feast for Crows was a placeholder, a holding action intended to keep the story going just a little during the decade-long creative struggle George R.R. Martin faced at the end of A Storm of Swords. It would be easy enough to set aside any objective criticism and instantly adore the book. But that's not how I am as a reader, and as grateful as I am for A Dance with Dragons, it's not as satisfying as A Storm of Swords, A Game of Thrones, or A Clash of Kings. This is not to say that it's a bad book -- anything but. It is at turns thrilling and terrifying -- a big complicated behemoth of a book full of unexpected surprises and deftly paid-off moments of plot. But there is trouble at the heart of it -- the fabled ""Meereenese Knot"" that Martin grappled with for so long. Before I continue, I want to note that I am going to avoid spoilers and speak in generalities. I understand that those generalities may be considered spoilers -- so read on at your own peril. But please be aware that I will not spoil specific plot twists, character reveals, etc. A Dance with Dragons is centered around three major story-lines -- Dany's rule in Meereen, as well as the many people trying to reach her; Jon's tenure as Lord Commander of the Knight's Watch on the Wall; and the north under the stewardship of the Boltons. Other characters and settings are addressed, including a few lingering threads spun out of A Feast for Crows, but Dany and Jon are by far the most critical characters in the book. The problem is that the ""Meereenese Knot"" isn't so much a knot, as it is a cul-de-sac. For five books now we've watched Dany develop as a queen, waiting for her to arrive on the shores of Westeros with her dragons and her army. And yet at the close of A Storm of Swords, Dany decided to stay in newly-conquered Meereen on the shores of Slaver's Bay to learn how to rule. Her arc is concerned mostly with that -- as well as the unexpected consequences of her decisions. The early chapters in the arc are some of the least interesting in the entire book, but Dany's arc begins to pick up steam in the last third of A Dance with Dragons, driven in large part by a compelling new POV character. Yet, as the book closes, I'm not sure that I'd say the knot is any looser than where it began. Only Martin knows for sure, but with so much time devoted to Dany, I'm not sure very much progress has been made. Jon's arc on the Wall also deals with the complications of rule -- the compromises leaders must make for the greater good. And as Jon makes some very difficult decisions, it's easy to wonder if he has some of his Ned Stark's weaknesses, or if he will rise above his father's mistakes. One could also say that Jon's arc has certain ... Shakespearean overtones. The Boltons are, I believe, the only true ""villains"" in the series -- characters so vile and evil that they are irredeemable. Yet, they are believable villains -- a family of sociopaths who pass on their predatory approach from father to son. Their story is told from a surprising POV character who I would rather not name, and I found the Bolton chapters to be especially compelling, as well as disturbing. The remaining characters and arcs in the story are probably best left unmentioned -- although they often eclipse the three major plot movements of the book and lay important pieces for books to come. I will say that I have gone from being lukewarm about Victarion Greyjoy to wanting to hop aboard a longship and follow him across the world -- the guy is an incomparable badass, reckless and bold, a true pirate lord. My old favorite Davos Seaworth is on hand for a few chapters and remains one of the most humble and truly brave and heroic characters in A Song of Ice and Fire. But my favorite POV chapters come from a completely new character -- one who shepherds in a whole series of changes into the series. Although A Dance with Dragons is a much more engaging book than A Feast for Crows, I believe many readers will find that it shares many of the unsatisfying elements that plagued its immediate predecessor. Playing pieces are shuffled into position (or out of position), but very little is resolved. This is not surprising for a series as big and ambitious as A Song of Ice and Fire, but with such a long gap between books, it can be disappointing. Unlike earlier volumes in the series, A Dance with Dragons does not tell a complete story -- it is more complete than A Feast for Crows, but only just so. Here's hoping for a shorter wait before the release of Winds of Winter.","2011-07-21","United States","","true","23","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25XBR3ER85SDG"
"B003YL4LYI","3","Not a Storm, not a Feast, but a slow Waltz of a Dance","This is a hard one to write about. We all wanted it so much. Those of us who read A STORM OF SWORDS in 2000 doubted we'd ever see A FEAST FOR CROWS, and when it finally appeared in 2005 it wasn't nearly the banquet everyone wanted. Now, nearly six years after that, A DANCE WITH DRAGONS arrives. To be honest, it wouldn't be humanly possible for any writer to give Song of Ice and Fire fans all that they crave, or even enough to sate them for what could be, realistically, another five-year wait. Any book will fail that task. As does this one, even while in some ways it succeeds. Partway through a re-read I'm finding more to enjoy, more gems and clues, but ultimately it falls short of what I'd like it to be, or would have expected. Unfortunately, Mr. Martin set his own bar impossibly high eleven years ago. STORM was, and remains, riveting, moving, exhilarating, utterly engrossing. I still believe that the second half of its massive text is one of the best reads anywhere, anytime. The sweep of characters across continents, through court, and within themselves never stops moving. It is a masterpiece of huge players on a stage of immense richness and depth. Then came FEAST. So much smaller, both in size and character. It had to be: the momentum couldn't possibly be maintained. While much-maligned, I feel FEAST is better and more purposeful than its detractors would believe. Its smallness paints a picture of what Westeros has become: the aftermath of STORM's turmoil. It felt like a stepping stone, a prologue to the next chapter. The calm before the next STORM. DANCE is not that storm. It is, however, the companion to FEAST, which is what it was meant to be. After so many years it is difficult to remember that DANCE is the other half of FEAST, the half that couldn't/didn't come out at the time. It's not going to be as immersive as STORM was because it was never intended so. DANCE matches FEAST's smallness by introducing (or re-introducing) smaller characters and smaller gains. There is no way the Ironborn or various Dornish can hold their own against Tywin Lannister, The Hound, Varys, Beric Dondarrion, Lysa Arryn, the Band of Brothers, the Queen of Thorns, Oberyn Martell, The Mountain, or the Others. The book will feel smaller because its people are smaller. It is a flagstone in a path, a setup for the next book. To judge it in this manner is to judge it fairly. So let's do that. Just because DANCE's (apparent) goal is to set things in motion doesn't meant it can't do so deftly. Two major plotlines emerge in DANCE: one in the north, and one in the east. While writing the book, Mr. Martin spoke frequently of untying the ""Meereenese knot."" Unfortunately, he never successfully does so. Admittedly, I have never enjoyed Danerys as a character, but at least I found her actions to be logical from her standpoint. Meaning, that while I may not have agreed with her decisions, I understood how she might have made them. Not so in DANCE. As expected, DANCE follows several petitioners/rivals/suitors as they close in on Meereen. Yet Dany's actions and attitudes towards them are often confusing, and frequently seem to run counter to her supposed ideals and goals. The courses of these suitors are often confusing themselves as they move towards or away from Meereen and Dany without strong reason. The result is a muddle of explanation and motive that never becomes clear and ends with a move that looks promising, but also as if the last year may be erased when WINDS appears; about as satisfying as ""This was all a dream"" resolutions can be. The storyline in the north fares better. At and around the Wall, Stannis, the Watch, and the wildlings dance around Jon Snow, new Lord Commander and beset by all. Mr. Martin details Jon's difficulties well, but his forays south to Winterfell and White Harbour are on the skimpy side, as is his attention to Bran in the far north. I said this was a difficult one to write about, and it is. I find myself asking ""What DID happen in all those pages?"", and it's not an easy question to answer. Of course, there are a few shocking moments and twists, a couple extremely so. Yet the bogged-down feeling of the Meereenese knot extends even to characters and places that traditionally have worked well, or better than well. Tyrion, perhaps the most deeply-drawn of Martin's characters, feels at short shrift in DANCE; he doesn't have enough to do, and what he does do feels half-hearted. Occasionally we get a glimpse of his wit, bitterness, or tenderness, but not for long, and not enough. Stannis, Arya, Melisandre, Roose Bolton, Jaime, and Davos are touched on briefly but never given a chance to truly speak in the way we're used to hearing them. Cersei has one moving POV that does advance her story and display her character well. Perhaps the best-rendered POV is one of an old character, now returned: Mr. Martin demonstrates the changes wrought upon the character with the insight and rawness we have come to expect and love. In no other POV are we brought so well into a character's heart. A hallmark of Mr. Martin's writing is his ability to create initial shock and lingering sorrow. There is some of that in DANCE, but not enough. This is likely its main flaw: it holds us at such arm's length. After STORM's embrace, we can't help but feel a little colder. When I saw the first season of The Wire, I enjoyed it. But it wasn't until the second season that I was blown away. The brilliance of the second season made the skill used in the first season appear as mastery in the way it carefully constructed plot and character. It was as if the first season was only truly there to launch the real story, and not be the story itself. My belief, or hope, is that DANCE and FEAST are similar stones in the path; they are the boat and the crew, but not the WINDS that move them. Moving them will be a formidable task: the crew is enormous and the boat ungainly. Watching their assembly was enjoyable at times, but I'm waiting for the real voyage to start.","2011-07-17","United States","","true","24","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6NXAWEJTPYT5"
"B003YL4LYI","3","Almost satisfying","I waited a long LONG time for this book to come out. I can say, I am not disappointed. Martin is a brilliant story teller. His descriptions and characters and world creation are amazing. However, after waiting so very long for this book, I was looking forward to, and even requiring, some resolution. There isn't any, and not only is there no resolution, but we are introduced to more characters and more plot lines. The story feels like it is too short. The characters are still the best portrayals of real people I've ever read. There are very few straight up villains (you know the kind - those that are bad just to because they are bad). Each characters has a history, a present and a future, their actions and reactions are utterly believable and in character. They grow and change and sometimes diminish. People who are detestable in one book are sympathetic in the next, and vise verse. But, as in his other books, Martin is not nice to his characters, in that they don't all live, and they certainly don't always get what they want or what they deserve. This book is no exception. My mother started reading the first book, and when one of her favorite characters was killed, flatly refuses to read any more. After many of us have come this far through all the books and all these years, be warned, not everyone lives to see the end. And, as with the previous book, this book does not include all the characters. This book, and the one before, were the same timeline split up amongst the characters. Although, I did not feel that each character gave anything to the story, meaning they did not all further the plot line. I felt like their chapters were just thrown in just because, just because I guess to get all the characters in. Jamie and Brianne get s very small, and virtually meaningless, showing. Cerasi gets some small play. Arya gets a very small part that has one small addition to the furthering of the plot, but added nothing to the greater scheme of things. Minor characters such as Theon, Asha and Stannis get big parts, but essentially go no where and I really couldn't care less about them. Jon and Tyrion and Dany have parts, but they are basically meaningless meanderings without resolution or growth. There are new characters introduced, or at least they seemed new to me but may have been more minor characters given grander roles (at the expense of already developed and loved characters) without delivering anything worthwhile in the end. Old characters seem to be in stasis or in a holding pattern, waiting for the plot to reach a certain point (or not since the plot seems to have frayed). I would have preferred Martin to leave people out if they have no part to play and allow more room to finish some of the more pertinent plot lines - and deal with more interesting, much loved, and existing characters. The plot had a lot of fluff and nonessential (often tedious and boring) added descriptions weather they be about food, history, or myths. I don't recall the others books have whole paragraphs about food or history, kingdom relations or myths. There were some pages I flat out skipped, which I don't ever recall doing in the previous 4 books (even during re-reads). And, as another reviewer pointed out, there is a lot of sailing, these people are sailing, then those people are sailing and then these people are sailing AGAIN!! And, the same goes for marching. And scouting and searching. I really felt like much of this could have been cut and more of the real plot lines put onto the end. There were some sections and some character chapters that left me thinking - well, what was the point of that?? Previous books had forward momentum and development for each character every time. Nothing extraneous was included. In Dance with Dragons, some characters have one or two chapters that really have nothing to say, or give just a hint of something that never takes shape and then are never seen again. Perhaps in the next book, some of it will have meaning, but why does it need to be included now? To take up space and try to fit into my memory banks, when it could be included later when its necessary to the plot and makes more sense? Overall, it was an okay read though this book seems to suffer from bloat and fluff and meanders lost. The characters and plot weren't horrible. I enjoyed much of it. Though, i kept looking at the completion bar on my Kindle, watching it move up and up, and waiting for something to happen. In the beginning, I kept thinking, I'm only at 15% or 30% or 40%. there's still time for it to get really good! But, it never happened. When I looked down and saw I saw at 85%, my heart literally sank. At that point, I knew there was no saving this book. There was no pulling out of the nose dive. And then, it just ended, without resolution of any kind, without a satisfactory climax, without regard for characters, plot, or us readers. It did not feel like an entire book, but more like a prelude. The other books were all massive as well, and there are plot line that continue on and on and morph and change, but every book just felt like a complete story in itself. Each ending was a crescendo that left me satisfied and wanting more. This one does not. The ending is a slow decline and a fizzle. It seems as if the book just got too long, and was just ended with no thought to resolution or timing or plot, or us readers. And the cliffhangers, well, all I have to say is, blah. They aren't cliffhangers so much as chopped off lines left dangling. Honestly dangling, chopped plots, bloated descriptions and fluff filler just seems like lazy writing to me. I felt as if we readers were simply paid lip service. I am not a mindless, escapist reader looking for cheap entertainment. Cheap, light entertainment is what I was reading while I wait for books like the previous installments of Song of Ice and Fire from authors like Martin, and there aren't many like either the series or the author. I was disappointed and a little insulted reading Dance with Dragons. The book was worth reading, well, I could not have passed it by lets say that, and I think there are important happenings to lead into the next book (though very few). I am glad I read it, but wish it would have been worth the $14.99 I paid for the Kindle version, and I wish I could have at least some of my weekend back . . . UPDATE: I just read a comment made by Martin that Amazon reviews, negative ones, are from sock puppets and trolls. I bought this book and all the previous books, and have read every one, often more than once. This review is from a actual reader and honestly a fan (for the most part).","2011-07-24","United States","","true","25","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CDWI3KBG241Y"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Lots of Loose Ends... But the Journey Will Continue and I Will Be Along for the Ride","***SPOILERS*** Alright, so most of us came into this book already knowing that we were going to be catching up on the characters we missed out on in A Feast For Crows. It was a nice surprise to be treated with some brief continuations in the stories of Arya, Jaime, and the dreaded Cersei (the walk of shame was immensely satisfying). I will say to have one measly chapter to continue Jaime's story was a tease and probably could have been omitted. The Davos storyline was gripping, but about halfway through the book, we don't hear from him again, which is a disappointment. I also hated witnessing Jorah wither into a pathetic shell of his former self. Quentyn's story was interesting, but ultimately depressing and his journey proving to be nothing but folly. Just when Bran finds the ""three eyed crow"" and finds his direction, we never hear from him again. I think GRRM wanted this book to set us all up for something huge. It wasn't supposed to resolve issues, it was supposed to complicate them. He was deliberately cruel in never finally uniting Tyrion and Daenerys. Tyrion is my favorite character and having to read about the torture he endured on his way to finding Dany was tough. Rather than come down on Ramsay Snow (I refuse to call him Bolton) with absolute fury, Stannis is instead slowed by a cruel autumn snow storm. Daenerys STILL doesn't make it to Westeros and spends most of the book trying to make peace with Yunkai. Jon Snow makes peace with the wildlings and takes them in as his own, struggles to save more wildings from Hardhome, only to have his entire course derailed by one letter that I believe is forged by Mance Rayder, in the process ticking off his sworn brothers. Yeah, that all sounds pretty negative and one would think that it was a very unenjoyable read, but it really wasn't! GRRM is unique in his approach and the fact that he doesn't always have to end his installments with some major form of redemption for our favorite characters is a great thing in my eyes. You come away from this installment feeling empty, and unfulfilled. Angry, even. But I think it's BRILLIANT because I believe that is what was intended. I feel like this book signals that we are in a transitional period and nowhere near the end. When readers can come to grips with the fact that ADWD is the 2nd half of a bridge between ASOS and the upcoming The Winds of Winter, it makes complete sense. I'm having a hard time understanding these terrible reviews. Further proof that there is an overabundance of cyincs out there and they just expect way too much. This and A Feast For Crows sets us up for what should be one hell of a ride. Will Brienne fulfill Catelyn's wish and kill Jaime? Will Tyrion and Jorah convince the Second Sons to turn on the Yunkai'i and side again with Dany? Will Qyburn's abomination, Ser Robert Strong, win Cersei the rule of King's Landing? What role will Varys play since he returns with such a bang in the Epilogue? Is Jon Snow dead or just inured? If he is dead, will Melisandre bring him back Beric Dondarion-style? What will become of Bran as the next Greenseer? Was the letter from Ramsay for real? Will Theon find atonement? What is Arya's role? Will Littlefinger's plan to wed Sansa to the heir to the Vale prove meaningful? Will Jon Connington take Storm's End and is this kid really Aegon? If he is, will the bannermen of Westeros rally behind him to take down the Lannisters and Tyrells? What will Daenerys do when she learns of Aegon? Come on, whether or not one thinks this was good as a stand alone novel (probably not), it was necessary. In the saga as a whole, we needed AFFC and ADWD. To me, it's akin to watching the clouds gather before the storm breaks loose. From here on out, I expect a pretty wild ride. Lightning, thunder, hail and a torrential downpour. When it's all said and done, I think we'll all realize the the series couldn't have survived without this book. The redemption will come, I guarantee it. We just need to be patient and let this whole thing unfold.","2011-09-25","United States","","true","26","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7AB1DIPP3IR0"
"B003YL4LYI","5","The Middle Chapters of an Epic;For the Undecided","I promised myself I would not review anything that already had more than 100 reviews; only a megalomaniac would bother throwing his two cents into an overflowing piggy bank. But I am writing this review, and I justify it but trying to address those who are considering reading SOIAF: 1. But you haven't read any of the books, and you want to know if it is worth starting. 2. You enjoyed HBO's Game of Thrones, and want to know if the books are as exciting. I think you should. A Dance with Dragons is the 5th book of a planned 7 book series. As such, it is part of the middle chapters of the saga. Frodo will not be casting the Ring into Mount Doom in this book. A Song of Ice and Fire succeeds, for me, because of the individual chapters and characters. Yes, I want to know what comes next, but, unlike some other multi-volume works, I am not reading the books to know the solution to the mystery. I read it for the journey. Dante would still be worth reading even if he had never finished ""Paradiso"". This isn't Dante, but it is a well told story. Dance with Dragons concentrates on the storylines dropped from A Feast for Crows: Dany,Tyrion and Jon Snow. The latter part of the book picks up where the last volume left off and adds chapters for Cersei and Jaime. Other characters get their voices, including Bran, Arya, Asha Greyjoy, and some new perspectives as well. Much of the Seven Kingdoms is in ruin, and winter really is coming at last. A sense of strained resources fills the book, and many of the criticized references to food are references to how little food is left. Those lords who have not been hurt by the war become disproportionately powerful, allowing some secondary families to become important players. Much of the book explores the wisdom of our familiar characters in unfamilar situations: will Tyrion's wits save him, now that he is no longer a rich Imp? Can Jon Snow succeed as the Commander of the Night's Watch in times more perilous than any commander has known in half a hundred generations? Now that Dany really has a throne, can she keep it? Does she want to? These questions are all addressed in this book. The remainder of the review may contain some spoilers. Be warned. Martin's writing is fresh as ever. I found some chapters of Feast for Crows uninteresting, but ADWD held my attention throughout. That said, I did get tired of Dany saying, ""If I look back, I am lost"" every time she made a poor decision. Jon Snow tells himself , ""You know nothing, Jon Snow"" as he makes one intelligent choice after another. ""Words are wind"" you tell yourself after a while. Tyrion ,Jon, and Dany all act rashly: in Dany's case, more often than not. Bran finds his destiny, and so, perhaps, does Arya. The scope of the book expands: we travel down the Rhoyne, spend time in Volantis and get to know more about the cities of Slaver's Bay. Enjoyment of any book is subjective, and far be it from me to disagree with anyone else's view, but a lot of the criticism seems to fall into one of several categories: 1. I don't want to wait for the end; give it to me now. 2. I want to see the last battle. I got burned by Robert Jordan, and it won't happen again. 3 This story is simply too long. I'm interested in (insert favorite character here) and the rest is a waste of time. 4. Everybody else is trashing it, and I don't want to seem out of step. 5. My favorite characters do stupid things and it annoys me. I am sympathetic to all of these complaints. I've had twinges of 3 (length), bits of 2(Dragons fight NOW, please), and a severe bout of 5 (Khaleesi cannot make up her mind, it is known). But I think the book survives all of these criticisms. I also believe that this book and the last were necessary to set the characters up for the final conflicts. I expect the next book (may we see it in our lifetimes)to get better reviews.","2011-08-16","United States","","true","27","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GWTJRKFCHIOU"
"B003YL4LYI","5","Back On Track","A Dance With Dragons seems like the ""responsible sibling"" of the series, having the burden to clean up some of the messes of of the other books while still trying to tell its own story. It has serve as the finisher of the incomplete A Feast For Crows, which it does fairly well, syncing up with AFFC for the fist half of the story. Also, it has to somehow gather up all the characters that were blown away to different parts of the world because of the Armageddon-level events from The Storm of Swords. And finally, it tries to solve the problem that has been there from the beginning and has become worse as the series progresses, which is, how the heck is Dany, wandering around in the east, going to reconnect with the rest of Westeros? And with that, a good portion of the book involves several characters sailing, walking, or riding towards the east to connect with Dany, each for their own personal reasons. Martin makes the most of these travels, introducing us to the details of the continent of Essos and the seas that surround. One of the travelers is everybody's favorite dwarf, Tyrion. In the beginning of the book, he basically serves as a stand-in for the reader to witness certain events, but by the end he is back to his usual scheming self. Since Martin needs Dany to stay in one spot so that those travelers can meet her, he has her stuck ruling the city of Mereen. This is a new role for her, as opposed to her familiar style of the wandering khaleesi warrior queen. Similarly, Jon spends the majority of his time as the de facto ruler of the Wall And All Points North. They both spend a large amount of time hearing petitions, negotiating with other monarchs, issuing orders, etc. Honestly, I have never really enjoyed the chapters in any of the books that centered on a monarch actually ruling, and Jon and Dany's problems ruling their respective domains is the same. However, I know that these scenes are a necessary evil, allowing Martin to quickly and efficiently give the reader updates on dozens of characters without much setup. So, plotwise with the travelers, Jon, and Dany, a good portion of the book is upkeep and cleanup. They were enjoyable, yes, but not amazing. The real amazing parts come with the remainder of the characters. The moments with ""Reek"" and the Bolton family were truly terrifying, the result of Cersei's actions in AFFC lead to some satisfying results, and Davos, Arya, and Asha are still enjoyable characters to read about. For me, the most satisfying was Bran, as he continues his quest that could possibly lead him to be the most powerful character in the whole series. On the other hand, I was really disappointed by Quentyn Martell, who comes across as a complete loser, Overall, I found ADWD to be very similar to A Clash of Kings in terms of plot. In both, you have a lot of characters making decrees and rulings, moving armies, and traveling to lands previously unmentioned. However, it seems to me that Martin's writing style has advanced in this book. He writes in a more subtle way throughout this book. Instead of saying exactly what happened, he instead drops clues here and there, and nudges the reader into trying to figure out what happened by themselves (and hope you come to the right conclusion!). I found this style enjoyable as there were several moments when I had an ""AH-HAAAHHH!"" moment when I figured out what was going on. On the other hand, I can see how other readers might not enjoy this. It requires you to pay attention to the details, through and through. If you are a person who tends to skim, I would guess you would not enjoy reading this book. I'm going to give the book a five star rating based on the fact that, plotwise, it was on par with A Clash of Kings, which I considered a four star book, with a bonus star to bump it up five based on the amazing writing style of Martin.","2011-07-30","United States","","true","28","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14X4NWDP6WT5R"
"B003YL4LYI","3","Better than AFFC, Barely","If you had told me to make a list off the top of my head before I sat down to read this novel, of events I'd want to see, or resolutions I was looking for, it would have been something like: Dany mastering her dragons, escaping the Meereen situation, and heading west. Tyrion arriving at Dany's court to serve her in his unique ways. The battle with the Others finally starting in a serious way. Jon learning who he is. Cersei's trial and the unleashing of FrankinGregor. What is Jaime going to do? Is Briennie dead, what did she say to get out of the noose? Quentyn arriving at Dany's court and revealing Dorne's plans to her. Victarion using the horn to control the dragons. Bran meeting the Greenseer and finishing his training. Arya finishing her training. A pretty obvious list based on the story so far, right? I would have been happy with 3 of these stories moving along, 4 would have been downright wonderful. Instead I got one and a half. And the kicker...it's the last one and a half I would have chosen. This would have been bad enough...only it got worse. GRRM manages to add two more very interesting plotlines, one of which is Stannis' battle for the North, the other of which we'll let be a secret, and he gives no resolution for them either. This is a novel that ended 200 hundred pages short. Throughout all of it we are given two ""big"" stories, the North and the East, and both of them look to lead towards large power altering battles that will rival the Blackwater...only we never get to them. The book stops before BOTH. It is a novel filled with ships sailing, and sailing, and sailing some more. Of marching, and marching, and marching some more. Jon Snow becomes muddled in food stores, concerned with wildlings, with not an Other in sight of the wall. Dany reverts back to trying to save absolutely everyone, doing anything at all to make a false peace, and turns on her own dragons. Cersei has 2 chapters, Jaime 1, and both of them feel like they should have either been included into AFFC or left out till Book 6. Bran and Ayra train, but it has no end in sight. Tyrion....Tyrion learns to cherish his inner dwarf. If all this doesn't sound exciting, don't worry, you will be lucky enough to get to read near 50 pages of food descriptions scattered about the novel. There is also about 100 ""You know nothing, Jon Snows"", about 50 ""Words are Wind"" and considerable ""I must go forward"" and something about Lannister's and debts I didn't know about... I can't say it was all bad. If there wasn't good I wouldn't be so disappointing in where the book ended after all. Reek, Barristan, Asha, and Davos were all fantastic, the single Melisandre chapter shed much light on a certain bastard's destiny, and my main-dragon Drogon was the star of the book. But...I have just finished 1000 pages, it is fresh in my mind, and what drives me to my disappointment is the thought of another 5 years...where I will have my list above, one scratched off, and yet two more added. 3.5 but it doesn't deserve the curve.","2011-07-13","United States","","true","29","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35IELAT6MZF6H"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Glad I Wasn't Scared Off By Bad Reviews","I should start by saying that I am a newcomer to the Fire and Ice Series. I started reading after enjoying the HBO series and was immediately hooked. I picked up the Kindle set of the first 4 books and read them all in quick succession. As soon as I finished I logged on to buy A Dance With Dragons and was surprised to see it had such a low overall rating and a glut of negative reviews from long-time fans of the books. Many reviews made it sound like the book was awful and a complete departure from the previous amazing works. Worrying I was was going to be disappointed and regret spending the $$ I planned to just get it from the library in the future. But I am glad I decided to judge for myself. PRAISE: I wish we could rate books by the half star. I couldn't give it 3 stars because it was more than just OK to me. But I am not sure Like It describes how I feel about this book either. What I can say is that I think this book's tone, pacing, and plot makes sense if you think of it as the middle of an epic telling of Martin's world instead of as an individual book. This book isn't as compelling as the first 3 in the series and doesn't have OMG moments like Ned's beheading or the Red Wedding. However I don't think it needs to have those to be successful book. We learn some new things we didn't know before and we see a different side of a few familiar characters. The story doesn't progress much and nothing much gets resolved, but I think that was intentional -- and not just to string the books out and make more money. I think Martin took a risk with DwD and achieved something very few authors do. His prose left his readers in the same place emotionally that his characters were throughout the book -- lost at sea, frustrated, unfulfilled, and feeling like what they long for is just within reach yet so far beyond their grasp. Somewhat manipulative and cruel = yes. But I don't think it was a result of poor storytelling. I think it was intentional to some degree and effective. CRITICISM: A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons should have been one book (as I believe was originally intended). The books could have been edited extensively and tightened so that Martin's achieved the same overall effect without making his readers feel strung along and manipulated by having to slog through two books where not much of the story progresses. And that is what I think the majority of the very low ratings are due to. If I had been made to wait multiple years for the publication of DwD I don't think I could look at it in a very positive light. A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons are the typical middle of a series books where pieces start to fall into place and not a great deal happens. Lots of series I have read have books like these and they always get lower ratings than the beginning and ending books. But where Martin erred big time was in taking so long to write this book and allowing excitement and anticipation to build yearly when he knew what this book was. That sort of build up would be great for the denouement but only breeds resentment when the book was always designed as just a sort of staging for what is to come. So I am giving Martin the benefit of the doubt because his first 3 books were so brilliant and the latter 2 were much better than anything else I have read recently even with their flaws. I think he would be wise to get Book 6 out within two years and to make sure it is fast-paced and ties up some of this one's overused loose ends. I will definitely read to the conclusion of the series no matter what and no matter when it comes. I think Book 6 will be the make it or break it one for me though. I would much prefer to read what is to come with anticipation and excitement and not out of a sense of duty to see the story to its conclusion. Guess we will have to wait and see.","2011-09-29","United States","","true","30","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LPR5NELKKWMI"
"B003YL4LYI","4","The Middle of the Story","I was immediately dissatisfied with the end of A Dance With Dragons. As the story ratcheted up the intensity, as events loomed ever larger on the horizon, I began to notice that there wasn't much of the book left. When it was over, it was all I could do not to scream. Six years of waiting for this? Some characters haven't been seen in ten years, and their return is like this? What is Martin doing? The Meereenese knot was this? There's more to it than that initial, visceral reaction, of course. A Song of Ice and Fire was originally envisioned as a trilogy, as most fans know, and the tail end of the saga has gotten longer and longer with time. Currently a proposed septology, which would fit well with the importance of the number seven in the world of Westeros and Essos, A Dance With Dragons signals the end of the story's transition from the blistering action of the first three books, moving the pieces into position for the home stretch. Martin mentions the fictional game ""cyvasse"" time and again in ADWD, and it's clear that this board game, which seems similar to chess (a hobby of Martin's, so much so that he's written at least one short story about the game), is an allegory for the story he's telling here. Hidden strategies and plotlines come to the front, and while he keeps many a mystery shrouded (with a few extra for good measure), he also continues to grow the struggle for power in Westeros. The scope of the point of view characters widens, including one old character which was fascinating to finally read the story through. The book is quite long, and for such a lengthy tome it seems like the plot doesn't always move very briskly, but the quality of the writing is generally on par with the series at large. Martin's very detailed description of the foods, architecture, and heraldry of the world of Westeros and Essos is never brief, but it also draws a complete picture of the story being told. My big issue with this book is what isn't included. It feels about 100 pages shy of a proper conclusion, because even in a story like this, told in large chunks, there should be some sense of the end of certain events with more to come. Both George and his editor have confirmed that some rather momentous events were removed from the end of the book, moved to the beginning of the Winds of Winter, and while it will certainly keep that next book moving smartly, it also leaves the end of A Dance With Dragons wanting. There's a rumbling volcano of a plot here, but the book is over right before it erupts. A large complaint within the fan community is that they had formulated their own ideas about what would happen here. While I found one character's journey to be frustrating at times to read through, with less progress than I'd hoped for by the final page, the story is Martin's to tell, not mine to forecast and then be disappointed by. It is the height of hubris to decide what one wanted to see, and then excoriate the author for not delivering on one's own personal predictions. If Martin has done one thing well with his series, it is defy the expectations of his readers, keeping them guessing and and occasionally stunned by events as they play out. I am probably the biggest fan of A Feast For Crows I know of; I loved its tour of a shattered, broken realm as seen through the eyes of the smallfolk. The story felt fairly contained and focused, even as it moseyed through Westeros. The story in A Dance With Dragons defines ""sprawling"", spanning the entire world Martin has created, at times going even further. It's a big beast of a book, and it doesn't really resolve much of anything, but like his many cyvasse-playing characters, Martin is just setting up the pieces for the end. This is the calm before the storm, the flash of lightning before the rumble of thunder. It lacks in payoff, but when considering the overall size of the story, it's a minor complaint.","2011-09-24","United States","","true","31","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2N92BEASU7Y4E"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Not really sure what all the hatred is about","As the 5th book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, Dance with Dragons may very well be the final expansion item in the series. This is not a bad thing per-se: it means that if you understand the pattern of the books, the story has not only progressed a great degree but the scope of it has gotten bigger and bigger and bigger. Whereas the first book focused strictly on the perspectives of the Starks, Tyrion, and Daenerys, the second book brought in Theon and Davos, the third book brought in Samwell and Jaime, the forth book brought in Brienne, Cersei, the Greyjoys, the Soiled Knight of the Kingsguard, The Dornish Guard Captain, and Reek. Now the 5th book, the story being told in parallel with A Feast For Crows, brought in the main characters back, caught up with the awesome ending that book, and then continued forward. And yet, as the story has progressed and expanded at the same time, it remains manageable, compelling, character-centered, thought-provoking, and a sound emotional mix ranging from frustration with people you hate, and gratification with people you love. I do have a theory about why there are so many 1 and 2 star reviews. Maybe it's because this story has drifted well outside the comfort zone of many readers and they simply weren't ready for it. By now, you the reader have been consumed into this world that is clearly bigger than you, and this story does require some serious comprehension. And I guess given the shallowness of mainstream books like Twilight and the Seinfeld-Banya rivalry, people prefer material they don't have to think about. And that's just unfortunate, because a quality story like the one told in Feast for Crows and Dance With Dragons, both of which given a long and drawn out 2nd act, really does deserve to be told and it deserves to be credited with thought and intrigue. The series has been amazing thus far, and unlike most others, I have embraced this difference. Here is a book series that immersed me into a world that doesn't even exist, and I am now torn on several sides, trying to figure out how best to rule and control it and how I would sort this political mess out. And because there is just so much there, to the point where fantasizing about acquiring the powers of Superman and warping into the world so I can kill who I want, save who I want, and fix everything is literally an impossible task. That the only purpose in my reading of these books is because I am desperate to see what happens next and I just want to see how it ends. There is no book series that has ever done that to me. And that's what makes Song of Ice and Fire valuable, particularly Dance With Dragons. Now maybe after all that, you're all wondering why I gave this book 4 stars and not 5. I only give something 5 stars if I think it is either flawless or its flaws are so tiny that they aren't even worth mentioning as flaws. In this case, I was a little disappointed with a couple of the character arcs in this book - particularly Bran. He's in the beginning of the book, and then a little later, there's this absolutely epic moment that I will not spoil that has to do with him, but after that...nothing. Bran has gotten cooler and cooler throughout the story and I really wanted to see more of him, but I guess that's material for the 6th book and this story was largely centered around Daenerys. This is understandable, but also a little disappointing because even her story was a little stagnant. There was plenty there, but there was a lot of nothing happening, followed by one also crazy and epic moment that really changes things but it's not something you'd be expecting and it has somewhat rendered what were/are my ultimate hopes for her, irrelevant. Not to say necessarily that what happened was bad, just that now I'm a little lost and I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it. But rest assured, Dance With Dragons is a stellar installment in the series and deserves your read.","2012-04-08","United States","","true","32","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIO1C37I35OQZ"

"B003YL4LYI","4","A Valuable Continuation of the Epic","So I finally got through this book! I've been reading it forever! And by that I don't mean to say that I didn't like it or that it was hard to get through, because it wasn't. Or at least, not any harder than any other of Martin's books. It's just a situation where I wasn't in a hurry because this was book 5 and book 6 isn't expected out for a long time (2015 according to Goodreads.com). So I would read a few chapters, then not pick it up for a few weeks. I read several other books, finishing them first while ADWD was on the back burner. It came and went, but I decided that I finally needed to finish it. As for the book, I won't talk much about the plot because, as I said before, this is book 5 and I don't want to do too many spoilers for earlier books. If I do any I'll warn you first. I've said it before and I'll say it again: I LOVE this story! The characters and settings and conflicts are masterfully done and once you get into the story, you just can't put it down. That said, Martin's writing style can be a big difficult to get into. You have to get used to the way he writes. His style isn't bad or amateur. It's just kind of heavy. Then again, if you make it all the way to book 5, I suppose you would've made your peace with the writing hundreds of pages ago. While book 4 focused a lot on the less mainstream story lines, Book 5 goes back to the more central conflicts and characters we've come to love. Many people have criticized this book for its meandering and...I can kind of see their point. I do wish Martin would move the story along a bit more quickly rather than going into detail about characters, cities, and cultures that have nothing to do with the main characters. Yet, being a writer, by the time I got to the end, I could see how he was shaping the story and where he was going all along. He just could have gotten there sooner. I've also heard criticism about the title because this sounds like it will feature a lot of dragon action, but, according to others, they barely spread their wings. I don't agree with this criticism. Though it's true that the dragons aren't the central element in the plot, I do think they were what this installment was always working up to. Near the end Barriston Selmy gives the title it's meaning. He says, Not all men are meant to dance with dragons. Notice that the ""dance"" of the title is singular, not plural. *minor spoiler* The character that does the ""dance"" dies in the process. I promise this is not a major spoiler because it was not a major character, but still, when you think of it that way, the Dance with Dragons in this book ended in death. So the point of the title is that the story points toward the cliff hanger end, which is full of death and ruin. One could argue that there are other dragon dances of course, literal in the case of Daenarys and the death pits and figurative for Jon Snow. All threads end in disaster (fitting for a novel which isn't the final one) and while the novel stalled a bit in the middle, the end left me desperately wanting book 6. There was also a very touching chapter near the end with Daenarys looking back over her recent choices and conversing with an imagined someone that she regrets having sent away. I found it very touching as it strayed into literary fiction and had a sweet, melancholy feel. Possibly my favorite part of this book. Overall, if you're into Martin's series, this is simply a continuation of the story. It may not be the most exciting installment (nothing has equaled Book 3 yet) but it's important to read this to get to the next part. Martin has set up some exciting things for book 6 and--like all the other epic fantasy suckers--I will be pre-ordering it when it becomes available.","2013-01-15","United States","","true","34","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KPCE5VP52LYU"
"B003YL4LYI","5","GRRM's Most Merciless Tale Yet","Let me start by saying this is a first rate novel. At times, I found myself lost within its pages, feeling the story’s suspense and tension in my very bones. It is better than “A Feast for Crows” and probably on par with “A Clash Of Kings.” But it is easily George R.R. Martin’s most merciless tale in the series. Imagine “A Storm Of Swords” ending right after the Red Wedding. Just merciless. “A Dance With Dragons” is the fraternal twin of “A Feast For Crows.” Originally, Martin intended them to be a single book, but after it grew two long, he broke it in two. He separated the storylines geographically, so the two books were supposed to take place at the same time. But that is only true for about half of “A Dance With Dragons.” Past the midpoint, the novels’ timelines converge and several of the stories started in “A Feast For Crows” continue in “A Dance With Dragons.” As a result, we have several chapters from the viewpoint of characters like Cersei and Victarion Greyjoy, who were major players in “A Feast For Crows.” There’s also scenes from Jaimie’s and Arya’s points-of-view, but none from Sansa’s or Sam’s. The main characters in “A Dance With Dragons” are all the fan favorites who were left out of “A Feast For Crows”: Daenerys, Jon Snow, Bran Stark, and Tyrion Lannister. The book also features a myriad of scenes from other characters’ viewpoints, including Theon Greyjoy, his sister Asha, Lady Melisandre, Barristan Selmy, Davos Seaworth, two princes of Dorne, an exiled knight who served as Hand to the last Targaryan king, and Kevan Lannister. It’s a thick character soup, but somehow it all works. This novel includes more scenes set across the Narrow Sea and around Slavers’ Bay than any of the prior novels. Many storylines are leading toward Daenerys and her dragons, and it’s in these scenes that the book is at its best. In fact if this novel only concerned Daenerys’ storyline, it would be a worthy read. Dany shows her naiveté in this one, revealing she’s still a young girl and not quite ready to play the game of thrones. As the title suggests, her dragons play a significant role, and the scenes involving them are among my favorites. Ser Barristan Selmy also takes on a leading role. He’s one of the few true heroes left in the story, wise and brave and noble like Ned Stark. We’ve needed a replacement for Ned for a while now, and Selmy is it. Of course, this means he’ll probably meet a tragic death in “The Winds Of Winter.” C’est la via. The bulk of the remaining action takes place in the North, where Ramsey Bolton has become the book’s biggest monster since Prince Joffrey. (Actually, Bolton is worse. Much worse.) He and his father have their eyes on Winterfell, which Ramsey hopes to secure through a marriage with a girl he believes to be Arya Stark. Meanwhile, up at The Wall, Jon Snow is dealing with Mance Raider and all the Wildlings who surrendered at the end of A Storm of Swords. He also has to deal with the presence of Stannis Baratheon and his red priestess Melisandre, whose prophecies are starting to play a major role in these books. Beyond The Wall, Bran continues to search for the three-eyed crow, and while his story arc makes long strides, it’s unclear where Martin is going with this character. By the end, the lives of nearly every character the reader cares about are far worse off than when the book begins. Pick your wedding, Red or Purple, and you’ll get the picture. Also, there are no storylines resolved in this book. Nearly every main character’s tale ends in some form of cliffhanger. So now, we must wait until “The Winds Of Winter” to learn what might emerge from the chaos that is the end of “A Dance With Dragons.”","2014-07-22","United States","","true","35","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2O0Q7Z40NMF6C"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Unlike most authors Martin doesn't dialog dump! Love his long narrative passages.","Long before the television show aired I was a huge fan of A Song of Ice and Fire: when I browsed all the fantasy books at the library Martin's was the only one that stood out. I enjoy writers like Tolkien who take their time describing a scene. It takes a great deal of talent to describe well and Martin does so very poetically at time. Other writers or I should say most dialog dump, whole pages of what could be a script of dialog for actors to read for a movie or television show, that type of storytelling bores me to death. Martin's unique style lends itself very well to audiobooks as well and I sometimes play the audio version as well while I read. My only negative critique is a minor one, I does have pacing issues, which made it difficult to stay with the book, and I took many breaks between chapters, especially the middle section. I just didn't feel like the story was progressing very far. Perhaps this was because it was supposed to be part of the previous book. If so, I think that it would have been better to have split the book into part one and part two, keeping the previous way of telling the story the same: switching from King's Landing and the south to Winterfell and the North, that way it would have given a much needed change of scenery and characters, making for a better experience for the reader. I believe Feast for Crows and A Dance with Drsgons was intended to be called A Dance with Dragons, if so not splitting based on location and naming the two books ""A Dance with Dragons Part I,"" and ""A Dance with Dragons Part Ii,"" would in my opinion been the better choice. ~Kenneth","2024-08-18","United States","","true","36","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NYR4F3MQ94QJ"
"B003YL4LYI","5","Why I loved it and some hated it.","So let us get some stuff out of the way. The first three are amazing. The fourth was lacking a little bit. Now that is out of the way lets talk about A Dance with Dragons. There is so much being thrown at this book series. I believe we should examine a few of them. The first I would like to address is I don't care how long it takes in between books. I think people would be a lot more kind to this novel if it had come out a year later instead of six that it took. I would say that anybody that this bugs has a valid point, but for me it just doesn't matter. I wait patiently for these type of things. So while I think they have a point it didn't ruin any part of this book for me. Another thing is ""that nothing happens and that it is just a placeholder for this series"". Again I could see it. Books four and five are the middle in this long series. Martin can't rely on it being new nor can he rely on its ending to maintain the narrative edge. So having said that I expected that these two would be like this. In a trilogy it is always the middle that suffers. When going into a massive series like this you need to give a little to get a lot. A trilogy is nice and clean having a beginning, middle, and end. A series of this size can't be like that. When entering into a saga of this size there is always going to be a little place holding. Some have commented on that certain characters take a step back in their development. This is also true. What the endgame is with this form of storytelling is that when the series is done that the impact will be greater on the reader than if told in a clean three act structure. This means that books six and seven (could) should be better for the very fact of the place holding that four and five have done. This will lead to the argument ""that this is all well and good but I just didn't enjoy this part of the story"". To those people I would say that you are right in your opinion. It's just that I have a big picture view while reading these books. Meaning that I enjoyed the heck out of this book. The argument has been made ""that it has to many new characters"". I see them as frustrating as well but I keep in mind that characters grow more interesting the more you read of them. Perfect example would be of Davos. I was not that into him in book two. When I got to book three I loved him. This is Martin populating his Universe before he starts to break it apart. One good note that some might find interesting (as I did) is that Martin said that books six and seven will not contain any new POV characters excluding the Prologue and Epilogue. So if nothing else you won't have that problem going forward. One note of interest is that the critical reviews for this one have been very good while reviews on amazon have been less than kind. I thought when the critics reviews came out that everyone was going to be happy again. That didn't happen. It is for this reason I decided to write my review from this kind of perspective. I hope this review shows that I loved this book but understand where you guys are coming from. I think anybody that gave this book a one star review was right. That is what they believed. They can not be wrong it is their review. I myself enjoyed my time Westros. I love epic literature like this. I will be looking forward to the sixth book as I hope you are too.","2011-08-04","United States","","true","37","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RADUZ8M12XWHI"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Winter is coming","It's autumn in Westeros, blizzards are already blasting the Seven Kingdoms with brutal force, and ""winter is coming."" Jon Snow is treading a dangerously fine line between keeping the vows of the Brothers of the Night's Watch and involvement with King Stannis' revolt. Tyrion is on the run for his life and hopes to find an ally with Queen Daenerys, but as is always the case with the Imp, he just manages to trade one peril for greater ones. It is Daenerys' destiny to reclaim the Iron Throne for the Targaryens, but doing so now means leaving her conquered city to her enemies and the slaves she has freed to their former masters. Meanwhile, her dragons are growing bigger and more unmanageable. As all the great houses make their bid for who will rule the Seven Kingdoms, north of the Wall the restless dead are gathering en masse to invade with the winter storms, adding slain victims to their ranks. Just as all the previous books in A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE have been, A Dance with Dragons is a tombstone-sized doorstopper of a book. (I purchased the Amazon Kindle version, and I swear my Kindle was heavier after I uploaded it.) An age has passed since A Game of Thrones kicked off what just might become the most influential series in fantasy since LORD OF THE RINGS. I've been anticipating A Dance with Dragons ever since I read the last sentence of the last book, A Feast for Crows, almost six years ago. A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is a colossal-sized epic. There is no getting around the fact that this series is really one long book. I think Mr. Martin's idea of a conclusion for each book has been to build up to the most shockingly climactic outcome imaginable and then leave the readers in a nearly painful lurch of a cliffhanger. (Fair warning: the ending of A Dance with Dragons is no exception.) This is made almost intolerable by the fact that fans will be lucky to get more than one installment per decade. But if you can put all that aside and just take the events as they happen in A Dance with Dragons, there's no denying it's another grand adventure. George R.R. Martin is one of those authors who could write the Yellow Pages and make it exciting. As complex and as large-as-life as this story is, and even considering how long it's been since I last visited his world, I had no problem keeping up with A Dance with Dragons. Martin has created some of the most interesting characters ever, and there are so many of them. It's amazing how he can tell a story from so many unique perspectives. I'm not sure I even know as many people living in the real world as there are living and dying within these books. He draws the plot out like a sharp blade from a scabbard -- one that will easily cut the careless. His underlying theme that every hero is the other side's villain is profound and believable. All the players in this deadly game of thrones have a strategy that seems like a guaranteed victory. But since Martin solidly established early on, that no one -- I repeat, no one -- is safe, it's anyone's guess who will hold the Iron Throne when this is done. Providing there will even be a throne to win. That will depend on the Crows holding the Wall against the wights and other monsters that have yet to strike in full force. It almost seems impossible that Martin will actually be able to wrap this thing up with a worthy conclusion, and do it in both his and his readership's lifetime. Call me crazy, but I think he can. Afterwards, blurbs on fantasy book-covers will claim comparisons to George R.R. Martin and A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, like they do now for J.R.R. Tolkien and LORD OF THE RINGS.","2011-08-17","United States","","true","38","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SBEMG2F4NAC4"
"B003YL4LYI","4","A good book with several flaws","After waiting six years for this book, I found that I didn't dive in and devour it like previous releases. I think after waiting so long, I felt like it could stand to wait a few days more without killing me. The Kindle edition starts right at the Prologue, which I found really annoying because George RR Martin gives a little foreword about the chronology of this book. If I'd read that first I might not have been so confused about the first few chapters I read. You have to realize that the first half of this novel is the other half of A Feast for Crows, so you end up reading a lot of overlap. In fact, one Jon chapter reviews *exactly* the same scenes as a Samwell chapter in Feast, which really annoyed me because I'd just re-read the first few Feast chapters so it was like reading something twice. That being said, it was great to finally learn more about what happens to Tyrion after his escape from King's Landing and more about Bran in the north. I think I've figured out who Coldhands is! The book delivers several shockers, revealing new characters and bringing back several old ones. In direct contrast to his murderfest in Storm of Swords, he goes on in Dance to prove that you shouldn't believe someone is dead until their body is being packed up by the Silent Sisters or they stop having chapters. Martin has become really good at a very slow ascent of a character's chapter culminating in a serious cliffhanger, then moving right on to someone else, driving you completely mad. The cliffhanger ending works well for linear perspectives, but when you're switching off to someone else in the next page, all it does is drive your readers crazy. With this book, Martin seems to be using chapter titles as a method of character evolution, using different descriptions and names for the same characters. I personally found it kind of annoying, but in the case of a certain ironborn, it did a lot to mark his progression through the story. There were several character perspectives that I just didn't care about and I don't really know what the point of it was. For instance, the Prologue. I thought it would serve some grander purpose later in the book, but I think it could have been accomplished with a simple paragraph in a Bran chapter. I found myself falling asleep during the Victarion and Quentyn chapters. Seriously, even if it's set-up for later, it just felt like fluff. Being that this book is called A Dance with Dragons, I expected practically every Dany chapter to be like her second to the last one and I expected her last one to end in a fiery blaze of Targaryen glory. Instead I was given a rather ho-hum ending to a season of The Bachelorette: Meereen Edition. The book is very Jon-centric, with something like every 2 chapters being about Jon. While I didn't mind this, I think it could have been condensed a little. Barristan chapters were particularly enlightening because he is so old and knew so many people from the past that we have only heard about in stories. Reek chapters were fascinating and Martin shows his unique ability to make you feel for a character you previously completely despised (as with Jaime). Sansa is completely absent from the book. While there are some truly magnificent chapters in the book and I'm happy with the advancing he did of the story, it's not the best book of the series by far. I'd rank it second to the last, beating out only Feast for Crows. Still, I give it 4 stars because I did like it. It just wasn't perfect.","2011-07-23","United States","","true","39","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AOIUAA9NQLO"
"B003YL4LYI","5","The story continues, and the world enlarges...","I am a bit surprised at the number of very low reviews for this 5th installment of the series. (?!) I cannot agree with those that say this book was a huge disappointment. Perhaps if I had waited 5 years or more, for the ""exciting conclusion"" I could see it, this is NO conclusion - but I read all 5 volumes over the summer on my Kindle - and honestly, the line between the end of one volume and the beginning of the next becomes a bit blurred that way. I was enthralled with the entire story...INCLUDING the so-called ""diversions"" of the Ironmen, the slow pace of change in Dani's world, and even the journey taken in vain by Brienne. In fact, that ""side plot"" I found fascinating, and felt that I was along for every painful step with her small group for the journey. So many negative reviewers have complained about the non-character chapter names. But, in fact, the new names for chapters about old characters are themselves very insightful. And how can folks complain about Martin's long and detailed descriptions of the heraldry, family histories and long-ago events?? This is part of what makes his world so complete and detailed! It's like reading LOTR AND The Simarillion together. I don't understand the cutting criticisms of Martin's recurring character motifs like ""You know nothing, Jon Snow"" or """"If I look back, I'm lost"". Yes, they appear a lot - no, it's not ""repetitive"" - any more than are the things that we ALL have coming back to haunt us in our memories from time to time. When something that we see or hear, has a huge impact on us, it causes us to re-think it over and over, perhaps for the rest of our lives. I have many such memories and voices from the past that I live with. Nor am I tired of the descriptions of the ravens landing on Jon Snow each chapter. I LOVE them. The ravens are a constant link to the past, they landed on him right from the start. I LIKE the repetitive quotes of ""Hodor!"", and I LIKE the slow-paced minutae of the hour by hour struggle through snow, forest or swamp...I have not personally found one boring moment in this narrative...or, if there is some times where the action is slower and the land is quietly patient, it only adds to the realism of a world ravaged by war, and trying to slowly recover! In short, this last installment was every bit as enjoyable to me as ANY of the first 4. Unless a reader is really just looking for more battle scenes or hand to hand combat with the undead, or just ""more of the same"" as the first books, this volume is EVERY BIT as rewarding as any of the others. In fact, I actually count it, and the many subtle suprises (Like, who was sent to find Jon's sister!) - and it's relentless march towards the upcoming climaxes - to be my favorite of the 5! So, it feels odd to see so many 1 and 2/5 reviews - I'm frankly astounded. I might be because, although I am an avid reader, I have NOT read many of these ""multi-volume"" fantasy series, and am not so aware of what these readers expect. Dune, Cities in Flight and LOTR are about the only others I can recall. And I tend to view those series as a ""whole"", not several parts of a whole. I give this volume, a Dance with Dragons"", 5/5: I thought it was fantastic - I had never even HEARD of GRRM until last summer, and I couldn't put it down from the start of volume 1 to the end of volume 5, and it never would have occured to me to ""skim"" the outlying bits, or subplots, as many have suggested (??)...not one word!","2011-10-05","United States","","true","40","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R643CJ2QIOQGG"
"B003YL4LYI","4","If I look back, I am lost","Today, just to prove a point, I read the opening of Game of Thrones. There is no denying - through the series, GRRM's writing has become careless and unwieldy. Hi He resorts to having characters repeat the same stale catch phrase again and again and again. Dany: ""I am only a young girl who knows little in the ways of war"" Tyrion: ""Where do whores go"" Barristan Selmy: ""I am too old for this"" Theon: ""Reek Reek rhymes with leek/meek/weak....."" And so on.. Like the storyline, the prose stalled and lumbered. Yet, that wasn't the biggest sin. What of our favourite characters? (SPOILERS). Tyrion - the cunning influencer, the unsung hero of Blackwater, has just a couple of talents remaining - making ""big people"" laugh and being an obedient good little dwarf. He takes to the role of the slave as if he's prepared all his life for it. Serving at feasts, riding a pig, wiping his big master's bottom - wouldn't any regular lordling learn all that growing up a possible heir to the richest family in Westeros? Dany - OK, she wanted to rule. But she doesn't. Some days she can't be bothered to hold court. She wants to float in her tub under the persimmon tree, and lounge around her terrace watching the ""pyramids of Meereen"". And choose outfits to greet Daario in - she's only a young girl who knows nothing in the way of war! She doesn't execute a single person, despite her own people falling like flies, and that's the same girl who nailed a hundred slave masters to crosses as a payback for slave children murdered in the same way, who sacked Astapor after cheating its masters out of the Unsullied, the girl had crossed deserts and conquered cities on her way to win back the Westeros throne. About that...It's all about peace now, man. Bran - becoming a tree? Really? The boy has crossed into the North Lands to get his legs back, and the best he can get is the offer of even less mobility. Arya - morphing into a chick from Kill Bill. Not that it is a bad storyline on its own, but having spent two books trying to find her family - anyone - this leaves me a bit bewildered that she makes no attempt to get news about any of them. She knows that Jon and Sansa are alive, and seems to have made a choice to forget about them. She enters this book as the Faceless Men wanna be, and exits as the Faceless Men wanna-be. How far she's come! Jon - knifed. OK, most theories seem to agree that he won't die, but you have to wonder why GRRM created such a noble, proud house populated by people you want to know more and more about, only to wipe out most of them so early in the series, maim and rain misery on the rest for the remainder of it. Jamie - appears only to tell us he is galloping off to join Brienne...not without telling us - again - that Cersei has done Lancel and Osney and possibly Moonboy.. As a tradeoff, GRRM unleashes a plethora of inconsequential, background characters, some of whom are quite disgusting, to make matters worse. Victarion comes to mind, brutish, cruel, stupid man. His casual cruelty and abuse towards his ""dusky woman"" was quite painful to read about. Why oh why do we need to know about him? Look, it is still a good read. It is still an amazing universe of characters, cities and events, still epic in its depth. I will still be buying the next book, if it ever comes out. But GRRM needs to cull and spare us the scum of Westeros. I've come too far now to stop reading - if I look back, I am lost!","2013-10-17","United States","","true","41","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R354R3PS1YP0L3"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Epic series","This book seems to have pissed off a lot of Martin's fans, but I loved it. I love these characters, the new ones, the old ones, the ones that suddenly reappear from the earlier novels (it rhymes with geek!) This wasn't as exciting as the first three, until the last 200-300 pages, but the world he lays out is so much bigger now. What he was trying to do with this was incredibly ambitious. 90% of the time, he succeeds. My prediction - after he finishes the next two or so (and based on the last third of ADWG, those are going to be some of the best in the series) the 4th and 5th books will have a lot higher respect because of how they enriched the series. ------ EDIT: Here's more on why I mostly liked this book (VAST SPOILERS) Dany - one of my favorite characters in the series - her chapters were the hardest for me to like. She makes terrible decisions in this book that we're forced to slog through. Chaining up the dragons pays off in the end (for the reader), but the marriage decision...ugh! I can understand what Martin was doing. She's a teenager making poor choices, as she has in the past, and it took a number of chapters to make those events believable. I guess it makes sense - from her perspective, she has no idea what's happening in the world around her, and she's about to get obliterated by a number of armies heading to Meereen, but I wanted the sly, surprising, vindictive Dany of the first three novels instead of this. However...I thought where he left her at the end was brilliant, and the dragons unleashed were superb. Tyrion - I enjoyed his chapters, although I can see why some would not. He's not a good person in his book, as much as he was in the previous ones. But I give him some slack here because he's outcast, left with nothing, hunted and hated. He's perceived as an ugly scarred monster, and his behavior feels real. He's self destructive and depressed. His story did seem to drag in parts, though. Jon - Sadly boring as commander of the watch, but the chapters are succinct. Knowing the ending, I'm looking forward to rereading his chapters. I DO NOT think he's dead, but that would be an interesting twist. Bran and Rickon - I love this story arch. I wish Martin had spent a lot more time with this instead of some of the other characters. The walkers coming out from under the snow was one of my favorite parts in the book, and finding the children of the forest. Quentyn - my favorite new character. His demise was pitch perfect. Arya - I enjoyed her becoming a secret ninja assassin. Theon - This is why I love Martin so much. Somehow, unexpectedly, Theon has become one of my favorite characters, and his sister too. All in all, with flaws and some dry stretches, this book still has enough great things going on to warrant 4 stars. Books 2 and 3 were 5+++ stars for me. In fact, they are the best books I've read in years. This one could have been as good. It was disappointing in parts, exhilarating in others. I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he's going to knock our socks off with the next books. The story has been gestating in his head for 20 years, and around the last third of ADWD, it really started to pick up again. You could tell he's excited by where this is going. The dragons are terrifying now that they're grown, the characters are evolving, and he's been saving spider-riding white walkers for about 5000 pages now. My hopes are high.","2012-04-05","United States","","true","42","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ARXJGX8CPIV7"
"B003YL4LYI","5","Winter has come!","-----NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW------------ Having just finished this book, I am a little bit surprised to see all the negative reviews. Although after reading them all, I can see their points of views. However, I still believe GRRM has not lost his way and this story is just as compelling as the first 3. Many people think this story moves along slowly, and there is a whole lot of nothing and dialogue going on for much of the story. I can't say that isn't true, but I don't think it's a bad thing. The thing you have to remember is although this whole story is set in a fantasy setting, GRRM still tries to keep his characters, actions and reactions as human and realistic as possible. Where most authors will see it through the end that important characters will persevere, GRRM has no qualms with killing them off to progress the story. So with all the crazy whirlwind of events that have passed in the first 3 books, there is going to be periods of downtime, much like in real life. A Storm of Swords ended with the Tyrion murdering Tywin and leaving King's Landing in chaos, Stannis and his army coming to save the Night Watch at the wall, Jon becoming the new Lord Commander and giving quarter to Stannis, Daenerys deciding to settle down in Mereen after laying waste to the other slave towns, and all the Stark children splitting off into the unknown (and much much more). After all that, what's to be expected? Obviously the pace and action won't be able to continue. At King's Landing, we'll have to see how all the characters pick up the aftermath of Tyrion's actions. At the Wall, we will have to see how Jon settles into his new position and see how Stannis will plan his next actions now that he has a small foothold in the north. Across the Narrow Sea, we'll have to see how Daenerys will handle actually trying to rule a city. These events following the fallout of A Storm of Swords is obviously going to not be as action packed. However I truly believe that this story is just as much about character development as the lore. So while A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons may lack the amount of action that some readers are looking for, it's still very very rich in character development, which I have enjoyed greatly. Also I think all the random characters that gets introduced for a few chapters are refreshing. One of the appeals of these books are all the different point of views that GRRM introduces. At least in my opinion, it feels like outside of Joffrey and Cersei, he does intentionally try to portray any side of the war as being the good guys or bad guys. They just are what they are, people fighting for their side of the war. Reading the story from one person's point of view will lead to bias on which side is ""good"" or ""bad"", so I welcome GRRM introducing some new perspectives to the story here and there. I really believe it only helps enriches the story. With all that said, I do believe A Dance with Dragons is deserving of a 5/5 rating. Although it lacks the action and pace of the first 3 books, it still does a spectacular job developing all the characters. But most importantly, by the end of the book, it has moved and set up all the pieces in this game for the Iron Throne for what should be a truly epic final 2 books. Winter isn't coming anymore....it has arrived!","2011-07-17","United States","","true","43","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R279EFHJ23ETCE"
"B003YL4LYI","4","A Feast, Part II","A Dance With Dragons is essentially A Feast for Crows, Part II. Both books take place immediately after the (insane) events of A Storm of Swords, and both books feature fewer major events than their predecessors. A Dance with Dragons emerges as the better of the two due to its point-of-view characters being those more central to the series' overall story. A Dance with Dragons has been criticized for being overlong, with ""not much happening."" Some reviews express the opinion that Martin's world has grown too large and his characters too spread out; many reviewers doubt that he will be able to bring them back together for a satisfying conclusion in the final two books. I disagree. It's true that this book doesn't feature the earth-shattering events of A Storm of Swords, but its description of the aftermath of these events is clearly moving the series toward its conclusion. On the Wall, the Free Folk are being welcomed as allies against the greater threat of the Others. In Mereen, Daenerys struggles with her abilities as a ruler, and she finally gets to use--albeit in a limited sense--those lovely lizards of hers. In and near King's Landing, Varys and a young man with his sights on the throne complicate the Lannisters' plan to salvage the realm. All of these events are important to the main plots of the series: the Others' return, Daenerys' journey home, and the Westeros ""game of thrones."" Are events moving as quickly as some would like? Perhaps not. But, to be fair, the series has had to change course multiple times in only a few volumes, and Martin is not unwise in taking the time to explore the consequences of his previous books. Before a certain execution in the first book, I would never have anticipated the large-scale civil war that occurred in the second book. Similarly, the events of the Red Wedding essentially ended the War of the Five Kings, so the fourth and fifth books take the form of the remaining pieces aligning themselves for the battles to come. ""Should it take two full volumes to do so?"" I hear critics cry. It's a fair criticism, but I think it's one that applies more to 'Feast' than 'Dance.' The experiences of Cercei, Brienne, and Jaime, while interesting from a character perspective, probably could have been edited down significantly without impacting the main story. The characters of 'Feast' just aren't as critical to the story as Daenerys, Tyrion, and Jon Snow, and, in retrospect, it might have been better to combine the two volumes into a single work. This observation doesn't diminish the value of the fifth book itself, which stands on its own as a fine addition to the series. There are wonderful opportunities for characters to grow in this volume, from Jon Snow's ""Kill the boy"" to Theon's character turnaround to Daenerys' confronting her own fallibility as a queen. If Martin can make me root for Theon Greyjoy again, his storytelling prowess is clearly still strong. It's true that Martin makes too much use of the ""character-in-peril cliffhanger,"" but we had these in book two (Bran and Rickon, Tyrion) and book three (Arya), and, while annoying, they are infrequent enough that they don't greatly detract from the book's overall impact. Yes, there were no major battles in this book, but neither was there in A Game of Thrones. As with the first book in the series, A Dance with Dragons is all about character development, and it thrives because of this. The pieces are in place for The Winds of Winter to be filled with the spectacular action sequences that fans of the series love.

"B003YL4LYI","3","What the hell happened?!","** SPOILER ALERT ** Nothing. Nothing happens. A whole lot of nothing. 1000s of pages of nothing. I read all five books in order one after the other for five months. This is the first book where I kept looking at the page numbers and wondering how much further I had to read. The Feast of Crows and Dance of Dragons suffer from the same problems. There is too much plot-stirring and not enough actual plot. Either GRRM is afraid to end this story or unable to end this story. After the first three books, there was a very clearly defined cast of characters who I had come to love or love to hate. But in Dance of Dragons, we spend 200+ pages with the Boltons! The Boltons are mean bastards. I get it. But I don't care about the Boltons. They are background characters. Cut back to the Lannisters -- those are bastards I love to hate. But instead of spending time with the Starks, the Lannisters, and the Targaryens, we spend 200+ pages with Roose Bolton and Jeyne Poole. Yeah, Jeyne whose great claim to fame is she was Sansa Starks' friend in the first book. The brutality of GRRM's world has created this weird quandary. If you kill all your best characters in amazing, spectacular ways, you are eventually left with a story full of secondary characters. GRRM has either killed, maimed, humiliated, immobilized or exiled all of his best characters. Therefore, we are mired down with the Jeyne Pooles in the 4th and 5th books. I don't understand why GRRM has created some plot lines that seem like dead-ends to me. For example, GRRM has sent Sam away from the action at the wall to train as a maester, something that should only take several years for him to complete. GRRM has sunk Arya into an alternative identity that requires her to forsake her ties with her family and her enemies, and thus her only reason for being in the story. And GRRM led Bran deep into the land beyond the Wall to sit in a cave and commune with trees and a dead guy. These story lines do add color to the world and exposition to the story, but they don't push the action forward toward a climax or a resolution. The story has gone off the rails. Dear George R. R. Martin, here are things I would have liked to read in next book. 1) I would like Dany to control her dragons and sweep across the eastern continent like the second coming of Aegon the Conqueror and start wrestling for control of Westeros. 2) I would like Jon to fight some freaking others. 3) I would like Theon, the Greyjoys, the Boltons, the Freys, the Manderlys, the Conningtons, and Davos to recede into the background. I am sure I forgot some random houses. 4) I would like Sansa reveal herself as the heir of Winterfell at her wedding to Harrold Hardyng and then take Winterfell back. 5) I would like Arya to learn just enough about assassinating people to be dangerous and then I want her to cross the ocean and kill all the people on her list. 6) I want Caitlin to exact her revenge on the Freys. I want her to walk into The Crossing like some unholy ghost and kill Walder Frey. 7) I want Jamie to do something cool, anything. Marry Brienne. I have no idea. Just something. Anything. 8) I want Cersai to put a crown on her bald head and act like the smart villainous queen who stood toe-to-toe with Ned Stark and took him down with aplomb, not like the lunatic she has been in the last two books. 9) I don't even know what to do with Bran and Rickon anymore. Just get rid of them and save them for some other story. 10) I want Tyrion to help Dany become queen of Westeros in exchange for her making him lord of Casterly Rock. Here are things I would like to not read about. 1) Lists of foods, banners, houses or otherwise. They are mind-numbing. 2) I don't want to read about banking or debt or money. 3) I don't want to read three books about Stannis, who is a major killjoy, only to find out that guy froze to death in a blizzard in off-stage action. 4) I don't want to read the song lyrics of The Maiden and the Bear or any other stupid song again. 5) I don't want to read these weird turns of phrase like ""one-and-twenty"" and ""break my fast"" that started in the 4th book. Also, ""leal"" is an okay word, but ""leal"" sucks when it is in every other sentence. 6) Please, no more lamprey pies. 7) I don't want to read juvenile puns about sexual acts.","2011-10-19","United States","","true","45","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKM994Z4XQ95Q"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Excellent story, but could use at least some plot resolution.","This review was originally posted on my blog and is worded as such. I enjoy Mr. Martin’s characterizations and there were some parts of this book that I was really interested in. Dany seems to be floundering across the Narrow Sea, Tyrion is wandering around with another possible Targaryen heir (who would have thought so many had escaped), new and old characters seem to be taking three steps forward and two back. Some of the characters may die of old age before their stories are resolved. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the bits about Arya’s continuing training at the House of Black and White. At least there is a little resolution there. I also really enjoyed what happened to Cersei, even though it wasn’t quite enough in my opinion – guess that makes me cold. It was also nice to see what was happening in Dorne as well since Myrcella was sent there quite some time ago and I was beginning to wonder what had happened to her. Hopefully there will be more to that plot line in Book 6. Books 4 and 5 are basically the same book split in such a way as to make the storylines seem completely disjointed from one another, but I did manage to glean some satisfaction from small advances in certain plot lines. At the same time, other lines seem to be floundering. This is as close as I’ll get to spoilers, but I am going to talk about some of the plot lines here. So avoid this section if you haven’t yet read the book. I’ll try to keep it mostly as a summary in case you feel obligated to forge ahead. Most of my favorites are still running around. Arya is growing up to be a most formidable young woman and I can’t wait to see where that leads her. As always, I find Tyrion incredibly interesting even when he is just off wandering around aimlessly with possible heirs to the throne. He’s just a witty, smart aleck and I love him as a character. Jaime Lannister seems to have had a bit of a change of heart with regard to some of his family, but was mostly off taking care of the Lannister family business of manipulating the other houses to do as his family thinks best, though after that he kind of disappears with a not so dead friend from the previous book. I’m keeping my fingers crossed for Jon Snow. I’ve heard rumors and it seems a weird time to be done with that line so I’m hoping that we’ll see him again in the next book. Daenerys’ plot line seemed to kind of flounder in this book. I’d really like to see if it moves forward and it would be fantastic if she quit telling people she was just a young girl with no idea about whatever topic they happen to be on. Those words don’t match her actions most of the time and though they may have originally been used to throw off her enemies, it now sounds pretty contrived as she stole 8,000 Unsullied warriors from Astapor previously and surely her enemies are starting to catch on. Okay, so with the parts I do like and the parts that I was somewhat disappointed in, this book still comes in at 4 out of 5 stars. Martin is an excellent writer and even when he’s meandering around something interesting usually happens somewhere along the line. I now join the thousands of others that are waiting impatiently for Book 6. I can’t wait to see how this series is resolved, if it ever is. Fingers crossed :)","2014-08-06","United States","","true","46","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QHR55FNYGZCV"
"B003YL4LYI","1","OMG! What happened? GRRM, you've changed, man--and not in a good way.","I just finished A Dance w/Dragons with a profound sense of disappointment. I kept reading this book hoping that after setting up the mail plot points, George RR would close out the book with monumental outburst of action, violence, battle and intriguing plot twists. But. Nothing. Ever. Happens. I loved Game of Thrones--the best fantasy book I've read since LOTR, and Clash of Kings held my rapt attention, especially with Tyrion's Machiavellian nature and the way he systematically outmaneuvered his sister and bent everyone to his will; and the series momentum, to large extent, was continued with Storm of Swords--though there were troubling sections in that book that led me to wonder what the author was thinking. (However, I thought the climatic duel between the Red Viper of Dorne and The Mountain was a tour de force--I keep re-reading that section hoping for a different outcome of the fight and always coming away disappointed. That's great story telling!) However, Feast & Dance should never have been written in their current form--or preferably not at all. Will somebody tell Tyrion where whores go? Yes, I get it--Jon Snow knows nothing. Jaime, did you know Cersei has been screwing Lancel & Osmund? One can cut 100 pages of text simply by removing all food references. If you remove all reminisces you could cut another 100 pages. Good lord! Did anybody edit this train wreck? Instead it's up to the reader to assess whether or not a paragraph is worthy of being read and then skipping to the next paragraph if the answer is ""no"" (which happens all too often--the vast majority of this book is mere ""fill"" the purpose of which is to extend the life of this series). George--what happened, man? Was it the money? Vanity? Who was responsible for deciding to turn this trilogy into a 7 book series? Are all the later books going to be 1000+ pages? Are you being paid by the word? Did you really think your fans would be interested in what Tyrion had for breakfast, lunch, and dinner while playing chess floating on a barge down some river to join Daenerys--day after boring & uneventful day? You might have pulled it off if they had joined forces in the end, but we were denied any resolution to this intriguing story line. Daenerys was one of my favorite character in the first three books; I loved it when she slowly changed from a frightened girl into a leader and conqueror in her own right; but in Dance she does NOTHING (unfortunately like all the other characters). The Daenerys in Storm crucified 163 Great Masters in Meereen when they sufficiently provoked her, yet she seems reluctant to do what is necessary to stop the Sons of the Harpy. Chapter after chapter and she does nothing. Lots of internal dialogue, reminisces, and angst, but she does NOTHING. At the end when she FINALLY rides Drogon, she still manages to do NOTHING. The beheading of the main protagonist in Game of Thrones was a brilliant stroke that riveted me and left me gasping to find out what happens next; but, George, you've gone to that well too many times--the shock value of killing off a main character has lost its power and now it looks like a desperate move to regain your magic. [spoiler alert!] Jon Snow was never one of my favorite characters, but why give him the Caesar treatment in a ludicrous plot twist that undercut the only interesting thing he was about do (march on Winterfell)? Or is he really dead? After all, Westeros is quickly turning into Zombieland. I know your stated reasons for killing off your characters, but you should know that because your penchant for mayhem This Reader now refuses to invest any emotional energy and identify with any of the characters for fear they'll be stabbed, shot, poisoned, or otherwise butchered at their wedding. I know there are no heroes in real life, but that's why I read fantasies--to escape real life for brief periods of time--not to have my heroes torn down and my nose rubbed in the nitty gritty detail of life in medieval times. And this brings me to another disturbing point: George--you're starting to creep me out with your sex scenes. From the start I was uncomfortable with girls being married off at twelve or thirteen, or whenever they ""flower""; it's now getting dangerously close to kiddie porn and I think you should back away from writing any more sex scenes involving girls. You have to be an writer of exceptional power (think Nobokov's ""Lolita"") to pull off this delicate subject matter, and as good a writer as you are, you are not that good. I'm sorry for venting; I guess I'm really very upset that a series like Ice & Fire that started off with such promise should get derailed so badly. George--you could have been one of the greats, but you threw it all away for another sack of money. My advice: do a DO OVER. Go back and pretend book #4 & 5 never happened and pick up the story from the end of book #3, apologize to your fans for wasting their time & money, ask them to burn their copies of Feast & Dance, and then wrap up the series in another book or two (maximum of 500 pages each), and do it in the next year or two; no more 5-6 year gaps. If you cannot summon up the energy to get this series concluded, just release the main plot points in a Black Lightning format and let your fan base take over the series. You're burned out.","2011-09-11","United States","","true","47","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TJIW6SNE9X7A"
"B003YL4LYI","5","""How Martin Means""","So much is said and written about A Game of Thrones and A Song of Ice and Fire that I will tell about my reading of the books. I thought I'd never heard about George R.R. Martin when I first read about HBO's TV series on the Web. This was in autumn 2011, and in USA the first season of A Game of Thrones was over, but in Norway, where I live, it hadn't started. When I discovered that all of the four books in A Song of Ice and Fire were among the best-sellers on Amazon, and that fans anxiously awaited A Dance with Dragons, I got curious and bought the four-book bundle for Amazon Kindle for $13.49. And that was it. I felt ambushed, caught in a trap and imprisoned, with no way of escaping. A Saga of Ice and Fire has so many fascinating and complex characters, so many parallel and intertwined plots, so many places and customs, and so much action that I was totally caught. I have never had such a captivating reading experience in my life. Having read A Game of Thrones, the first book, I told myself to take a break. It lasted for two hours. After A Clash of Kings, the second book, I actually managed to escape for a week, but I was captured again. The rest of the books, including A Dance with Dragons which had been released by then, I read at a stretch, using every free minute. And the worst of it is, that the same day I had finished A Dance with Dragons, I started all over again. This time I read a bit slower, studying maps, family relations, religion and and all the rest at the very good wiki at Westeros.org. It was at this time I realized I had read George R.R. Martin before. He has written the introduction to a wonderful book called Meditations on Middle-Earth, in which a lot of fantasy writers, including John Anderson and Terry Pratchett, tell about their reading of J.R.R. Tolkien. In the introduction, Martin is especially preoccupied with how Tolkien changed fantasy: ""J.R.R. Tolkien was the first to create a fully realized secondary universe, an entire world with its own geography and histories and legends, wholly unconnected to our own, but somehow just as real,"" he writes. And that is what Martin has done with A Song of Ice and Fire. He has created a fully realized second universe, even richer than Tolkien's. The best article in Mediations on Middle-Earth is ""How Tolkien Means"" by Orson Scott Card. He writes about the meaning of novels and the meaning of reading. He mocks the analytic and superfluous reading of academics and critics, who scan for clues at the surface of the text in their search of a deeper meaning. According to Card, the deepest meaning of a novel cannot be found through analysis; it can only be experienced. When you throw away the analytic glasses and dive into the story, live with the characters, feel their joy and pain, hope their hopes, and despair over their fate; that is when you experience the real meaning of a story. The meaning is not on the surface or somewhere else, it is in the story while you're reading.

"B003YL4LYI","2","Engaging...but lacking in substance.","As I was reading a Game of Thrones, I came to suspect that I had stumbled upon something special: complex characters, endless viewpoints, challenging themes, an intricate and engaging story. When I finally made it to that fateful last chapter, there was no longer any doubt. As I had come late to the party, I immediately raced out to buy and read Clash, Storm, and Feast. All of them as good or better than the last (with the possible exception of Feast for Crows). Then came the long dark... waiting and waiting and waiting, eventually even forgetting about a Dance with Dragons. Only then when I had completely forgotten that it was even in the works, I heard the announcement. I marked the release date on my calendar with eager anticipation. I never even saw it coming. This book, while somewhat engaging, is simply put: too long. Many before have suspected that Martin has somewhat lost control of the story, and is unsure of where to go. I am in 100% agreement with this theory. It really hit me around page 400 when I thought to myself: ""I'm on page 400 and *nothing has happened*..."" It felt like I was playing some sort of never-ending RPG with a lackluster story, wandering around haphazardly with no real purpose or goal. His verbosity even trends towards the redundant. I can't tell you how many people are disemboweled in this book....wait sure I can! I did a search for ""entrail"" in my kindle, which resulted in 13 entries. - ""entrails from their bellies..."" page 12 (location 328) - ""entrails coiled through a bush"" page 67 (location 1540) - ""entrails dangling out"" page 125 (location 2826) - ""beneath his mail to get at his entrails"" page 256 (location 5723) - ""open your belly, pull your entrails out, and make you eat..."" page 261 (location 5851) - ""its said they hung their entrail in the branches..."" page 385 (location 8594) - ""strung those entrails through the tree"" page 385 (location 8599) - ""he would pull out your entrails and make you eat them."" page 614 (location 13643) - ""a fistful of slimy black entrails"" page 676 (location 15024) - ""begin rooting out her entrails"" page 696 (location 15482) - ""I want to pull his entrails out.."" page 740 (location 16480) - ""her lower leg with entrails and maggots."" page 856 (location 19009) - ""as the pit fighter's entrails came sliding out"" page 886 (location 19698) Aren't there other ways to die? I feel like his creativity is starting to wane. Worse yet, the more I started to think about things, the more they started to bug me. For instance, there is absolutely *nothing* profound about the phrase ""you know nothing."" Surely it couldn't deserve yet another 13 references right? Wrong. I'll spare you the list, but feel free to do the search for yourself. Also, common sense tells me that one blast on a horn would warn you of coming danger, and two blasts would signal all clear. What if you couldn't get the second blast of the horn off because you were being disemboweled by some foe as your entrails are bursting from your midsection. Why would you make the warning signal *harder* to pull off? Granted, a minor point, but a valid one. <THIS SECTION CONTAINS SPOILERS> Another frustration I had with this book came down to playing time for some of the primary characters. 1000 pages of story and some only have a chapter or two devoted to them. I understand that the book runs in parallel with Feast for Crows, and that some of the characters don't show up until later in the book, but what's really unfortunate is that some of those chapters don't even add much to the story. I'm still not really certain what the point of Arya's chapters were, but I guess one could argue that every good story has some fluff. Jaime & Brienne get some references, but again, not much in the way of plot. Bran reaches his destination and that plot point does get interesting, but it ends up another loose end that we'll have to wait to have tied. All that being said I will admit that there was one major plot point that needed to be addressed in this book, despite how badly we wanted to skip it. Dany had dragons, but it was unclear exactly how she was going to tame them for battle. Based on Martin's commitment to realistic scenarios (despite the obvious fantasy), it wouldn't have been feasible to have Dany immediately launch an attack flying high above her armies on the back of one of her dragons. Though with 1000 pages to work with, I could imagine an author finding enough wiggle room to get that part of the story in. However, I give Martin credit for not glossing over it. This book does have some saving graces. I found the Jon Snow chapters to be quite engaging, so if you're a Jon Snow fan, you will not be disappointed. I'd also argue that Tyrion Lannister is one of the greatest characters of the series. I warn you that there is a ton of fluff surrounding him in this book, most of it unnecessary, but he's still the same complex, black-hearted, self-loathing character of his father's creation that he has been for the past 4 novels. While my review was mostly negative, I would also agree with most of other negative reviews that I will continue to read the series. While Dance with Dragons was not everything I hoped it would be, I'm willing to give Martin a mulligan. Despite the 1000 pages, I admit that I stuck with it to read every single one, so that has to count for something. Let's hope that he'll get back on track with Winds of Winter, and we can get some resolution to all of these lingering plot points.","2011-08-27","United States","","true","49","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1466Q17SYJ5R3"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Fair and honest review from a long time fan","***(No spoilers)**** I came into this ""Dance"" with zero expectations aside from the fact that I figured this book would be part two of ""Feast"". Taken from this context the two books together make a decent book four. So basically before you even begin to read ""Dance"" make sure that you are up to speed with what happened in ""Feast"". Overall, I felt that this entry was the weakest of the series, but only because a few of the plot lines themselves were rather mundane or our of character. I'm mainly referring to the Tyrion and Dany plot lines here. Tyrion's ongoing drama between he and his siblings in the first three installments was one of the main reasons why he is one of my favorite characters in this series. In this book (for obvious reasons to those who have read the previous installments) such banter is eliminated, which really had to make for difficult writing on Martin's part. While definitely the weakest Tyrion story so far, I was not left completely unsatisfied, it's just not the same without the sibling rivalry. As far as Dany goes, I must say this was the plot line that really bugged me the most. Like many reviewers before me, it seems as if she has a completely different personality in ""Dance"" from previous entries, which really made her story rather annoying for me to read for the first 3/4 of the book. However, I really enjoyed what occurs towards the end of the story with her, so even though her overall storyline was weak, in my opinion it ended on a strong note. While I was left moderately unfulfilled with the above two story lines, I thoroughly enjoyed the Jon and Theon plot lines immensely. Both had very interesting twists and turns that culminate in classic Martin shockers, and I really thought Martin did a good job of moving some of the more interesting story lines from ""Feast"" along, namely Arya and Cersei. Many other reviewers seem to be annoyed with all of the different viewpoints that Martin introduces throughout the book, but when taken in context with the story they actually do make sense and move the plot along. I got no sense that he was planning on keeping up with each of these characters in future volumes, but that this seemed to just be a way to tell ""Dances"" main story lines from different vantage points. This is part of the reason why I like Martin's writing so much. He is able to really flesh out even the most mundane characters and give them life. While ""Dance"" is the weakest entry in this series, I truly thought the book was well written and do not think it is a bad book at all. ""Dance"" is not as exciting as the first three books, however when read in context with ""Feast"", ""Dance"" completes a decent fourth entry and ultimately does seem to set up many scenarios that could be culminated in the next chapter. Ultimately, the next book will be the one that makes or breaks the series for me. If Martin can return to form from the first three books, then these two will be seen as the middle point of the entire saga. For now, I will take them as such and am willing to give him the chance to reign all of the plot lines together in book six. I have confidence that he will be able to do so, hopefully some time before 2015.","2011-09-02","United States","","true","50","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MQBBN7CMIVJJ"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Dissapointing by GRRM's standards, amazing by others'","Of all of the ASOIAF books, this was the one I most looked forward to. The title suggested something fabulous was going to happen with Danerys and her dragons, and after A Feast For Crows, I was eager to learn everything GRRM admitted had been left out of that book. Unfortunately, very little actually happens in this book. Admittedly, that's because most of the book is taken up with retelling AFFC from other characters' points of view, but even after all that has been done, very little happens. Certainly nothing happens that answers any of the questions and cliffhangers from AFFC. I feel like characters are safe again. At the beginning of ASOIAF, any characters, no matter how central or important they were, could lose their heads. Now, GRRM seems to have lost his teeth, and is reluctant to kill off any characters, even minor ones, even when it seems to me at least, that thye should have died a dozen times by now (Davos, any one?) Part of GRRM's appeal to me was the fact that nobody was safe from him, but that's been lost now. At one point, a MAJOR character is missing, presumed dead, and I never once feared for their safety. In earlier books, I would have assumed the worst. This book has the same unfinished feel to it that AFFC did. Important characters are referred to only fleetingly, and some not at all (there's no Sansa or Petyr or Samwell, those chapters were written but will appear in The Winds of Winter). AFFC is very tightly focues and constrained, wheras ADWD is sprawling and wide-ranging. I think, having gone straight from AFFC to ADWD, the contrast in the two styles threw me, and as a result I didn't enjoy ADWD as much as I did the previous books. The cliffhangers come a little freely in this book. I've often called GRRM the king of cliffhangers, but that's because I think he is a master at timing them, and resolving them timely as well. There were too few resolutions in this book, and when they came, they were incomplete. YI was left thinking ""Ok, so that character who in AFFC seemed ansolutely certain to die, is alive. BUT HOW? WHY?"" The resolutions to some cliffhangers were only given a fleeting mention- some only a few words, which was frustrating. The evolution of some characters is disappointing. Jon Snow being made Lord Commander of the Night's Watch would obviously change him, but I think he's changed too much, and he's very annoying. He spends most of the book seeking advice off all around him, then ignoring it and doing his own thing. Other characters' progressions are overly drawn out. I, for one, wish Arya would hurry up and finih her damn training. I spent most of the book waiting for Tyrion to come into his own, and be the conniving devious git he was in the earlier books. Don't get me wrong, this book is brilliant. The characters are all believable and deep and three-dimensional, the plots are intricately woven and the setting is incredible. By the standards of other writers, this book is breathtaking. By the standards GRRM set in his earlier books, it's a little disappointing, especially after such a long wait. If I had read the books as they were released, I would have been waiting 5 or 6 years between A Feast For Crows and this book, and I would have been sorely disappointed.","2011-11-26","United States","","true","51","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2P0TXC8CITRN5"
"B003YL4LYI","3","Book was good BUT it’s a Cliffhanger with no books to come","WHY did GRRM stop writing the books ? When I purchased the “full collection” AFTER watching the HBO Series, I was not expecting them to be identical BUT , I was at least expecting an ending. With the detail he goes into with SO MANY characters … I became a little concerned at the end of the third book wondering how he would tell the remainder of the story in only 2 more books. Now it would appear that he woukd need AT LEAST another 5 books. In truth, the ONLY book worth paying for was the prequel (that starts with Aegon the conqueror). The rest will just leave you disappointed when you find yourself with no endings.","2025-05-31","United States","","true","52","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2P1W8F93DTY8B"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Comes up short due to the lack of resolutions","Like the previous 4 books in the Ice and Fire stories, George RR Martin continues to captivate me with this incredible ensemble of characters and their multiple layers of stories that all play together in some form or another. Minor Spoilers But just like A Feast Of Crows, A Dance With Dragons suffers from the problem of not a lot happening. Both books build up a lot and resolve nothing. Instead leaving its fans frustrated with a series of cliffhangers and unanswered questions. In Dance, the story slowly builds up to two major battles in the story and after reading page 1000 you realize that Martin has no intention to actually deliver the battles in this book, instead making you wait until the next book to find out what happened. Like Feast, this book appears to be about putting all of the characters in place for Martin's end game, whatever that is. Other than the prologue and epilogue, this story features 16 different POV characters though the bulk of the chapters come from Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister. I've always liked reading these characters chapters and Jon Snow continue continues to be one of the best characters in the books in my opinion, but the other two character's chapters became a bit tiresome after awhile especially Dany's. Tyrion's entire arc seems to be about him running into different groups and people along the way, finding out their plans and abandoning him (or getting captured) by another group until he gets where he wants to be. Dany's is in Meereen and there is no end in sight and instead of her coming to Westeros, Westeros is coming to her with several POV characters attempting to narrow sea to meet her though the big players don't actually complete the trip in this book. Jon's still on the wall and he's trying to tow the political line between doing what's right for the Watch and the realm and keeping his alliance with Stannis Baratheon, who is still looking to raise an army and do what he feels is necessary to protect the realm. The interaction between these two characters are some of my favorite moments of the book (probably because they are my two favorite characters). Jon begins to look for help in places he would least suspect in order to help the Night's Watch prepare for the inevitable attack of the Others as a new threat emerges from a place Lord Snow least expected. Another pleasant surprise POV was that of Reek aka Theon Greyjoy. Last we read he had been taken prisoner from the Bolton's and was being tortured. When we find Theon he has been completely broken by the torture of Roose Bolton's sadistic son Ramsay. Gone is the overconfident smagger and all that's left is a meek little man who lives as the family dog and follows Ramsay's every order in complete fear. Reek refuses to allow himself to think about who he used to be but Theon has still got to in there somewhere right? After the evils he's committed there's nothing left for Theon at this point except salvation of his soul. Again, I think the book is great. Its another incredible chapter in the Ice and Fire series but don't go into this expecting any major revelations or resolutions. Its a set up book to get the characters in place for the next one.","2014-04-18","United States","","true","53","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17DQE9NUXTQHR"
"B003YL4LYI","5","Great Writing","George RR Martin is an excellent writer and is so skilled at making chapter after chapter compelling, even as character POVs shift rapidly. His writing is very detailed and personal, while providing a constant stream of information from past events that slowly weave their way into the plot. This is not a series for those who want rapid resolution or a clean outcome in 7 books or less. Rather, this A Song of Fire and Ice is a hugely ambitious narrative of life struggle past, present, and future. Relax and savor the tale. It is difficult to rate A Dance of Dragons as a stand alone book, simply because it is book 5 of a huge story with few clean tidy break points. To me the most compelling chapters are those taking place in the North (Jon, Bran, Theon). The battle with the Others is slowly taking shape. Jon attempts to prepare the Wall for the struggle with winter while attempting to end the distinction between ""wildings"" and the rest of the kingdom the Night's Watch is charged with protecting. Bran finally is trained in using his special gifts by the mysterious Brynden, and we learn the details behind the importance of the weirwoods. The children of the forest enter the picture finally too. Ramsay Bolton is a great villain along with his father Roose Bolton. Theon Greyjoy transforms into an entirely different character and the reader has a great amount of sympathy for him as his suffering unfolds. I also like that Mance Rayder plays an important role. Melisandre remains a bit of a mystery although it becomes increasingly clear that she has Stannis confused with Jon in her prophecies. Jon's assasination is an important step to moving him closer to his role in the conflict with the Others. Why did Hardhome burn 600 years earlier? The Arya chapters have had a harder time fitting into the big scheme of the series, but she is clearly being trained to kill some bad folks in future books. I was also pleased to see Tyrion reemerge and his plot line was key to understanding the motives of Illyrio Mopatis and Varys. Tyrion's chapters are always amongst the most entertaining, and tagging him along with Mormont was a great idea. The young prince Targaryen and his decision to take an army to Westeros without Daenerys leads to an interesting quandry for the aged Prince of Dorne. I did find the chapters taking place in Mereen to be a bit tedious as times with the constant fretting by Daenerys (teenage angst). The reentry of Drogon helped move things along. Back in the South of Westeros we follow Jamie wrapping up loose ends from A Storm of Swords and Brienne is back from the noose. Cersei is freed and the scheming resumes. I had enough of Cersei in A Feast of Crows to be honest, so not reading about her for 700+ pages was a nice break. The Iron Fleet arrives at Mereen to play their part. Time to pack up the characters and go to Westeros. Overall, the story evolved substantially but my guess is that 4 more books are needed to wrap up the series (20 more years of writing should do it).","2013-06-17","United States","","true","54","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15DL4Q3N19341"
"B003YL4LYI","2","Annoyance with Dragons","Reality can be harsh to happy endings. Evil is not always defeated, the hero does not always get the girl, and nobody ever really lives happily ever after. That's fantasy. Take, for example, the tale of a plucky fantasy author, battling to finish his life's work, who overcomes a six-year-long bout of writer's block to at last complete the fifth installment in his epic. It would be nice to think that the book thus produced was worth the wait. That would be the happy ending. But reality can be harsh to happy endings. ""A Dance with Dragons"" is not the book I waited six years to read, and to wish otherwise would be fantasy. George R. R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series was never mere fantasy, but with each new volume, it is becoming more and more a daytime soap opera. Mr Martin famously spent the second half of the 80s working in television, and if I may jump to unwarranted conclusions, this experience seems to have helped him break new ground by infusing fantasy with some of the best aspects of TV--sharply-drawn, sympathetic characters, crisp, witty dialogue, and intricate plotting. He's also made clever use of catchphrases and personal mottoes to provide a kind of leitmotif to each character's story and give a sense of continuity and cohesion to the tale: ""A Lannister always pays his debts"", ""If I look back, I am lost"", ""You know nothing, Jon Snow."" More famously, he's gotten good mileage from his willingness to kill off seemingly key characters at surprising moments. Maintaining such a high standard of writing for even one book would have been an impressive feat. Mr Martin managed it for three, stumbled on the fourth, and after 20-odd years working on the series, the fatigue is beginning to show. The personal catchphrases continue to get good airtime, with ""a Lannister always pays his debts"" featuring five times, ""If I look back, I am lost (or doomed)"" six times, and ""You know nothing, Jon Snow"" an impressive 13. However, much of the other writing has become simply repetitive and lazy. The phrase ""words are wind"" also pops up 13 times in various character's mouths, ""much and more"" (meaning ""a lot"") gets used as hefty 30 times, but this is pipped for the number one spot by ""(s)he was not wrong"", at a teeth-gritting 33 times. These phrases have become less a leitmotif, more a pianist banging the same three chords over and over again. As part of the series' gritty image, Mr Martin has never been shy about including sex in his stories, but now he appears to be shoehorning it in, simply for its own sake. One character spends the night before a siege having graphic sex. Another pays a surprise visit to one of his generals--and interrupts the latter mid-coitus. A description of a man being burned at the stake takes time out to tell us what happens when the fire reaches his genitals. The habit of killing off characters has likewise devolved into self-parody. Having already killed off most of the expendables, Mr Martin spends most of ""A Dance with Dragons"" only appearing to kill off characters, but not really. One is apparently executed, but isn't. Another appears to drown, but doesn't. Yet another seems to be beheaded, but--well, you get the idea. The effect is a bit like the boy who cried wolf, and cheapens the book's finale, in which two key characters appear to die, since by then the reader doesn't believe for minute Mr Martin will actually follow through. The other major drawback to the wholesale slaughter among named characters is that Mr Martin spends much time introducing a slate of new characters in much the same way that the old Star Trek series used to introduce new red-shirts. What is left? Plot, but not much of it. Most of the characters spend their time somnolently staggering from A to B. There are sporadic bouts of frenetic action, to be sure, but the story itself continues to plod along, fairly aimlessly as far as I can see. With no resolution to any of the major plot lines anywhere in sight, it's increasingly hard to care about any of the latest crop of characters, knowing they probably won't live much longer than halfway through the next book (when and if it is ever published). It's only in the handful of chapters that ""Dance with Dragons"" shakes off its lethargy and wraps up in a number of cliffhanger endings. I would like to believe the series will get better, that all questions will be answered, all the plot lines will come together, but if there's one thing Mr Martin has taught me, it's not to believe in happy endings.","2011-08-06","United States","","true","55","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30X0YJAKDANX4"

"B003YL4LYI","4","George R.R. Martin's fifth installment in The Song of Ice and Fire saga","A Dance with Dragons is George R.R. Martin's fifth installment in the Song of Ice and Fire saga. This is a massive tome, as were the other four offerings, and further develops the world and characters previously introduced. Martin posed a question to his readers: would you rather hear half the story of all the characters, or the whole story of half the characters? The latter choice won, so this book was meant to run somewhat concurrently with the fourth book, A Feast for Crows. If you are this far into the series, then you are probably familiar with the basic plot lines. If you have not read the other four books, I would urge you to do so, otherwise you will be totally lost. In fact, I have read the other four and still feel lost at times. The book is formatted the same as previously with the chapters titled with character names, and thus the chapter mainly concerns the happenings of that person. One problem I have is that there are just so many characters. Granted only the major characters have chapter headings, but sometimes I have a hard time remembering a minor character who was introduced in a previous book. That is one of the problems I have with these books. Another problem I have is that Martin is extremely long winded. A description that could be handled with a sentence or two takes an entire paragraph. Here is one example from page 842: “They hung upon the walls, before her and behind her, high and low, everywhere she looked, everywhere she turned. She saw old faces and young faces, pale faces and dark faces, smooth faces and wrinkled faces, freckled faces and scarred faces, handsome faces and homely faces, men and women, boys and girls, even babes, smiling faces, frowning faces, faces full of greed and rage and lust, bald faces and faces bristling with hair.” And that is just one example. In my opinion, 1000+ pages was overkill. Some have accused J.R.R. Tolkien of the same thing (perhaps something about the 'R.R.' ?). But hey, Martin is an accomplished author and I am not. No one can say they didn't get their money's worth, that's for certain. Some character story lines just do not resonate with me. It seemed that in A Feast for Crows that was a common occurrence. As an aside, I felt book 4 was the weakest of the lot, and if I hadn't already purchased book 5, I may have stopped reading the series. However I am glad I didn't. Jon Snow, Tyrion and Cerci Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen, Stannis Baratheon, Ramsay Bolton, and Theon Greyjoy are just some of the characters followed. The last 100 pages or so were the most exciting, and there were some interesting plot twists involving Jon, Cerci, and Daenerys to name a few. This was a decent read and I will probably purchase the next installment in the series, whenever it may become available. One of the reasons I like this series is that it seems no character is totally good or totally evil, and they continue to surprise. The first book in the series, A Game of Thrones, is still the best in my opinion, but this may be second. I am rounding up and giving this 4-stars.","2016-09-22","United States","","true","57","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V8J81FS59QWF"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Dance resets the stage","----------This review contains no spoilers to Dance with Dragons. ---------- I have read and loved the world George R.R. Martin created for many years now. I first read Game of Thrones about 10 years ago, and have been enchanted and engrossed in A Song of Ice and Fire since then. First, I would preface my opinion by stating what I would rate each of the books in the series. I would give 5 stars to A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords. I would give 3 stars to A Feast for Crows. And I give 4 stars to A Dance with Dragons. Dance kept me page-turning more than Feast (which felt more sluggish and departed from the original three books). In Dance, I enjoyed the characters covered much more. There were a lot of ""oh wow"" moments and some definite surprises. Reading some of the reviews on Amazon, I tend to agree with a lot of the other 4-star reviews. Martin's writing is very good, and he still has the ability to surprise; but I agree that it's frustrating with how many things were left hanging and not understanding the point of some of the things that have gone on. It may be that as the rest of the story unfolds I will understand it more. Dance leaves off with a lot of uncertainties but with the feeling that the next novel is going to be huge with a lot of elements pulling together and a lot more resolution. A Storm of Swords was very much a climactic novel, and it left the period of time that Feast and Dance covers to regather and rebuild. And it builds a great deal in Dance. I think some of the bad reviews are people frustrated because of this building, and the desire for more resolution, not liking the idea of waiting years for more answers. My own hope is that the next book will not be so long in coming, because the tension of the story is built up high now, it seems like a lot of foundation is relaid since Storm. Things feel very ripe for an explosion of action. I don't really feel that some of the bad reviews I have read are deserved. The scope of the story has grown and broadened since the first book, where it initially focused on a few people, and it now is cascading out as the impact of those characters and their stories affect the state of Martin's world. The history of the world he has created is impressively rich. I won't say that I love everything that happens; I still hate what happened to Eddard for that matter. I wonder at the decisions and choices of some of the characters I've gotten close to, but they are so very human and real in my opinion. After reading it, I have a lot of various hopes and worries for characters, and to my mind it is a talented author who can provoke such feelings from the pages of a book. I will be sitting and waiting for the next, as I waited for Feast and I waited for Dance.","2011-07-24","United States","","true","58","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPKJ5J18542IK"
"B003YL4LYI","4","As Good as A Game of Thrones","A Dance with Dragons shows Martin at his best again. This book is gripping and tends to avoid giving POV's to annoying, angst-ridden characters, unless they are about to die. Roose Bolton proves to have three dimensions to his character, while--to his disappointment--Ramsay remains utterly 2-D. Ramsay is less a person and more a tattoo of a madman on a piece of human skin stretched out flat. Under Ramsay's careful tutelage Theon Greyjoy tries to redefine ""redemption"" in a way that even Brienne of Tarth would take note of but Brienne-haters may take joy from the fact that the Maid of Tarth herself has NO POV in this book. Also lacking any real presence are Samwell Tarly (except for his Castle Black departure scene) along with the cast of Old Town, Euron Greyjoy and his cast of animated underwater friends: Spongebodkin Fingerdance and the rest (although brother Victarion has a strong presence), and anything more than a single whistful mention of Petyr Baelish by someone reminiscing over the good old days when King's Landing had any coins. Most of the action takes place in the east, where nothing goes as planned in Mereen, absolutely nothing. It is a wonder that although Valyria built so many roads of such straight and durable perfection, no one who travels them ever manages to travel them directly--not if they are characters in this book, at least. I will have to re-read these sections with careful reference to the maps to determine how Tyrion and the three--yes, three, and none of them include Archmaester Maerwyn--other parties finally make their way to almost maybe actually arrive in Mereen by the end of the book. Well, the journey is half the pleasure, or in this case, half the pain. The other half of the pain is redeemable upon arrival in Mereen. For most characters this other half is deferred until the next book. In the North, well, I don't want to talk about the north. A great many things happen up there but Martin has thrown some cliffhangers at us and it may be that the wrong people are hanging off the cliff. Indeed, near the end of this book I felt we had almost come full circle to the end of the first book, except without knowing for sure if Eddard Stark were dead. Is a character dead if you didn't really see him die? I am thinking not, but I am imagining the assassination scene in The Godfather, but with daggers instead of bullets. And then the movie ends. I am not going to wait five years. Again. At least Bran finds his three-eyed crow and has the logical rules of skinchangers, greenseers, weirwoods and even the old gods finally explained to him. It actually makes a lot of sense and could have been ascertained from all the hints in the earlier books. But you didn't figure it out either. See you in 2016 when he publishes the next one. Best Line in the book: ""The gods are not done with me. Lord Ramsay is not done with me.""--Theon Greyjoy.","2011-07-15","United States","","true","59","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T7EI55HI98ST"
"B003YL4LYI","5","People don't know a good book when they read one","Spoiler alert. Don't read this if you haven't already ready the 3rd or 4th books. Ok people, those of you who are saying this book is boring or that there is no ""plot advancement"" obviously aren't true fantasy/sci-fan fans and/or have no understanding or appreciation of the amount of time and talent that went into the making of a book like this (much less the entire series). Not to mention an innordinate amount of impatience. I will agree that there are a lot of characters in this series, but I would not say it's boring or that there's no plot advancement. How can you say there is no plot advancement when he kills off major (and minor) characters at the most unexpected times, takes plot twists when you least expect it, and ends chapters (and entire books) on cliffhangers that leave you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next? Yes, there is ""downtime"" for the characters and yes, they have self-reflection and think and ponder on things. That's what makes them real, believable, and relatable. This is what's called character development. And GRRM does character development on a level I have seen few authors accomplish. GRRM is a born writer, truly talented in a way that others can only dream of. I actually like that he takes you so far in depth into the characters rather than just having random ""bad guys"" throughout who are presented as such and you never hear their side of the story, what made them that way. Instead you are just forced into the only point of view that the author gives you which is that this is just a bad person. But maybe something bad happened to him when he was younger, maybe he doesn't want to be a bad person and wants to redeem himself, or maybe he really is just truly evil. By giving the backstory to characters with such a high level of development, he lets the readers form their own opinions rather than just telling them what to think. I mean, I actually cried when Robb, Grey Wind and Catelyn were killed and when Brienne and Podrick were killed. Maybe some of you will think that is lame, but I think it shows you how compelling these characters are and how relatable they are. I wouldn't have been nearly as sad about Brienne and Podrick if I hadn't known as much about them as I did. Anyway, I say it's a GREAT book, and a GREAT series. If you truly LOVE fantasy/sci-fan then you will LOVE these books. But if you get bored easily, are highly impatient, or just don't CARE about characters the way I do, then don't waste your time reading these books. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but don't knock something and say negative things if you aren't even a true fan of the author or the genre. True fantasy fans have a fine appreciation for a good, hearty fantasy read, something deep and gritty and powerful, not your fru-fru pop lit damstel-in-distress-princesses-who-wait-for-knights-to-save-them-fall-madly-in-love-and-kill-the-evil-monster books.

"B003YL4LYI","4","Good but lacking","A dance with Dragons is a good book that has its moments, but the moments are to few. I think this book was the weakest in the series but it was still a good book overall. My biggest issue with the book was that it was over 1000 pages, but they did not manage to close or resolve any of the subplots in the story. The book builds and builds pressure like some giant pressure cooker. I keep turning the pages faster and faster, anticipating some great pay off, but once I get to around page 900, I begin to understand that the payoff that I am anticipating will not come. The pressure cooker begins to build even more pressure, and just when it is about to explode..... Its over. I have to wait another 5 years to see what happens next. I cant understand why we needed two books to tell all the things that have happened since a storm of swords. I enjoyed A feast for crows unlike so many others, I even enjoyed this book. I just felt like with the two books we should be further along in the story. I love the idea of Danny staying in Mareen to set things right there. That is consistent with the character. I just wish they had fought whatever war they were going to fight and been done with it. I love reading about John Snow and the Wall. I just need him to fulfill his destiny. I could not wait to see what happened when the Iron fleet landed in Mareen. Now I am beginning to wonder if the Iron men will ever make it back to land at all. Stannis, one of my favorite characters, getting up off the mat and giving it his best shot was also something I was looking forward to. Its a shame that famous Stark saying has postponed his comeback. In addition to this many of the cliffhangers of feast for crows were barely touched, or ignored all together. All in all I think that GRRM sets the pieces in place masterfully for the next book, and I can not wait to read it. It is time for this story to begin contracting. The expansion phase has gone on long enough. If he could have contracted some of the subplots and given us some satisfying closure to at least some of them, then this book would have been a masterpiece. I give it a 4/5 when you consider this book as part of the whole story, but in truth it is closer to a 3/5. Intriguing but not wholly satisfying. This is the least of GRRM's books in the series. But it is still better than the majority of books I have read this year. I would recommend the book for die hard GRRM fans, but if you wait for the next book to be released and read this book two weeks before it came out you would be better off.","2012-01-05","United States","","true","61","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10X855JDYG2PJ"
"B003YL4LYI","2","Oh god, not another Dany chapter!","Warning: This review contains an ample amount of spoilers, but I promise it won't drone on about the book nearly as long as Martin drones on about honey-covered locusts. I think I should go ahead and preface this entire assessment of the book by saying I'm a huge fan of the first three books in this series. They're simply amazing, there's no doubt and I think it'll be hard for Martin to top the literary genius displayed in them. Things started to go south a bit once A Feast For Crows came out: the compelling story was starting to disappear and the spotlight was beginning to center on a list of characters that was both too long and included characters (Yeah Brienne, I'm talking about you here) that either weren't interesting or weren't important... or both. While this book was a disappointment to most fans of the first three books, it looks like a masterpiece compared to A Dance With Dragons. There's a rule in most forms of fiction and it definitely applies to a fantasy story: KISS - Keep it Simple, Stupid! George R.R. Martin would have done well to learn this before he even sat down to write this mammoth of a book, ~1000 pages with about 100-200 pages of actual material. This actually brings me to my next point, and this isn't really a rule that has a cute acronym or anything, it's just kind of something that any author should know: You need to advance the plot, and if you don't, do not write the book! While failing to advance the plot as is the case with most of the characters in ADWD is bad, what's worse is that some of the characters actually regress and the story almost goes backwards. Let's take a spoiler-heavy look at what was accomplished over the course of this book: THE BAD: Jon: Has a few good chapters at the beginning where he gets to do some badass things and actually look like a capable leader. Quickly becomes endless chapters of worrying about rations, hearing crows say ""Corn, corn, corn"", and ""You know nothing, Jon Snow""s. I was disappointed but surprised to find that the King Beyond the Wall was killed but don't worry: Martin no longer considers death to be as final as it used to be. I lost count of how many times we had ""gotcha"" deaths on the part of multiple characters. Jon's chapters end in an incredibly contrived HBO-friendly cliffhanger. Dany: I would suggest skipping her chapters and simply reading her last couple. You won't miss anything at all and you'll thank me later. Her chapters are filled with endless descriptions of a place we do not care about at all (If it isn't happening in Westeros, it shouldn't have over half a book devoted to it honestly) but her chapters are also filled with so many strange names for characters we don't care about that it honestly starts to get muddled. I was incredibly confused throughout most of her chapters and found myself skipping whole paragraphs because I knew A. They wouldn't have anything important to say and B. I'd be lost anyways. Don't worry though, the prospects of the HBO show actually someday getting to the fifth book have somehow caused Martin to backpedal Dany's character back to a scared, naive little girl that fawns over bad-boy sellswords and doesn't budge an inch out of Meereen. I wish I was kidding. The dragons in the title of the book? They don't do jack, so have fun with that. I audibly groaned every time one of her chapters was up next. Tyrion: My favorite character previously, nothing happens at all. If you like reading about incredibly large turtles I guess these chapters will be right up your alley. While he doesn't accomplish anything his chapters were at least sometimes entertaining, giving them a slight advantage over Dany's. Connington/Quentyn/Victarion/Jaime/Mellisandre/: Their viewpoints are largely a waste of time. Connington and Aegon are notable however in that they are actually invading Westeros and they don't even have dragons to help them. Not exactly what we were expecting from the title, but I guess it'll have to do for a game changer that came out of virtually nowhere at all. Quentyn's storyline comes to an extra-crispy end with nothing having been accomplished at all, making us wonder why all the time was spent on it in the first place. Victarion, while an interesting character, doesn't do anything of note in this book and his chapters were also largely a waste of time. Jaime didn't have anything to say, and Mellisandre's chapter was pretty pointless as well. THE GOOD: Theon (Reek): Pretty well written chapters and his character DOES advance somewhat. I could've done without the incredibly strange decision to have him aid in the rape of a teenage girl, though. Davos: Gets maybe three chapters, but at least stuff does happen in them, so I also give them a pass. Arya/Bran: They each get 2-3 chapters and while it's still ambiguous what exactly is happening to Bran, it's at least entertaining to read about what they're going through. Barristan: Again, at least he did things. He did more than Dany did in a small fraction of the chapters. Asha: Gets two chapters, serves only to let us see what is going on with Stannis' army. Oddly, Martin chose not to let us see any confrontation with Bolton's forces in this book. You can either be naive and assume Ramsay Bolton is telling the truth about killing Stannis or trust in Martin's sudden ""writing for television"" mentality and assume the letter was a lie. Personally I feel this is something that should have been shown in THIS 1000 page book. If I missed any characters, my mistake. It means they weren't important at all either, so much so that I couldn't even remember them. You'll notice the viewpoints that are actually worth something generally are over in a few chapters. This book could have been 1/4 the size it ended up being and nothing would have been lost from it. Other problems with the book: I can only read the terms ""mummers farce"" and ""words are wind"" so many times before I start to see it as padding. I don't need to know every single food item being served in a dining hall. I don't care what color beard Mercenary #238 with no spoken lines has. I only want to know about pertinent Westerosi history. I can't count the number of times a useless character would drone on about the history of Westeros for paragraphs on end. I could have done with an introduction that actually was tied to the book more meaningfully, or at all. I'd suggest checking this book out, and reading the chapters I said were good as well as the last few chapters of Jon and Dany. Use a synopsis online to figure out the rest. Hopefully Martin will be able to get some of the old spice and love for the series back, but the future looks rather bleak.","2011-08-21","United States","","true","62","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R366YC3QK7PBFQ"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Great But Beneath its Weight it Stumbles","I discovered GRRM a little over a year and a half ago, devouring A Game of Thrones through A Feast for Crows. What I enjoyed most about GRRM's writing was the uncertainty factor (and the gray factor where no one is entirely good nor evil) in some characters . . . the storyline, the gradual and multi-faceted fleshing out, then, bamm, they're dead, or a character that I despised I now could sympathize with and understand a little more about where they were coming from all along. A staple in the books thus far is the depth of character development invested in all the peoples wandering across the realms amid the sprawling storyline. So after reading the first ones I then had to wait for A Dance With Dragons. I didn't have to wait nearly as long as many readers but I awaited, hoped, and at times anxiously perused GRRM's website for development news. Then, finally, it was released and I've finished it but I'm feeling a little disapointed. Backstep to A Feast for Crows which I felt was a break I in the narrative where we encountered more about Cersei, The Kingslayer & a few other characters that hadn't been focused on. Which all in all was good and certainly expands on formative material and motives but I missed Tyrion and some of my other 'peeps'. But I must confess, however, that I'm beginning to tire a little with the relentless drama of little people with big egos stomping all over the world and trying to lay claim to what remains. Oh, but that sounds like real life, whoops! I digress . . . . Back to GRRM and A Dance with Dragons. I can't help but wonder when The Others will begin to cast their shadow and make their presence known. Winter is Coming, yes. Or so I've heard. The first chapter of the entire series focused on them yet we have so little involving them ever since. . . The Game of Thrones has eclipsed, perhaps, the greater power and threat in the lands. I can't help but wonder whether GRRM has, in his desire to flesh out a world with characters both big and small, wandered off into the woods and is striving to find his way back to the path leading out; I hope the momentum is reinvigorated and we as readers are allowed to observe his characters to wrestle with the true threat, The Others, an unknown force, barely glimpsed, whose motives and intentions remain an enigma. I look forward to reading the upcoming books of the series and mean no offense in my criticism. A great vision and staggering plot which I'm grateful to have encountered. In actuality, his depth is an inspiration to me in a market where so much is blase' and just plain fizzles. In A Dance With Dragons I just found myself wondering, wandering and growing bored with the petty, vainglorious squabbles of little kings and queens in the Greater Scheme of Things.","2011-08-21","United States","","true","63","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S2FIRD76IHAX"
"B003YL4LYI","2","So Many Words, So Little Plot","How, HOW is this book averaging 4 1/2 stars?? When did abject overwriting and lack of plot advancement warrant such a rating? Here were my thoughts going into this book (Spoilers): 1. Surely Daenerys would finally at least BEGIN her journey to Westeros to claim the Iron Throne with her super Unsullied army. - Nope (But ANOTHER Targaryen, whom the reader has spent a whole 30 seconds with, is poised to fight for the throne). 2. Surely we'd see a good, dramatic trial for Cersei. - Not a chance. 3. Surely Tyrion would do something, ANYTHING to get the story moving. - Negative. 4. Surely the White Walkers would finally factor into the story. - No. 5. Surely Stannis would wreak havoc in the North and at least somewhat avenge the annihilation of the Starks and be a real threat for claiming the throne. - Sorry. 6. Surely Dorne would begin to play a larger role in the Game of Thrones. - Don't be silly. 7. Surely Bran will begin to play a part in all of this. - Not quite. He's a tree now. Or a crow. I'm not really certain. How can Martin write SO many pages yet have so little happen? I mean, if you want to know what a character is eating to break their fast, or what color someone's surcoat or tokar is, or what color the bricks of a city are that day, or that words are wind, then this book will be riveting to you. And are we supposed to care more about Westeros or Essos? Becasue ADWD sure is Essos-centric. In fact, 99% of Martin's world seems to be made up of it, with the people living there viewing Westeros as some insignificant backwater. Reading AGoT, I thought that part of the world would just be a jumping-off point for Daenerys. But no, it now has become the virtual main setting of ASOIAF. Why did Martin make that decision? I want to find out what happens in Westeros. Or do I? I'm not sure what the reader is supposed to be focused on because Martin is just all over the place. Toward the end of the book, Dany hallucinates and talks to Jorah Mormont who reiterates that he told her to go to Westeros because Meereen was not where she belonged. I felt as if Martin was mocking us because it's what every frickin' reader would have told her as well. So why did you make us read hundreds of pages about her fretting away in Meereen?! And, at the end, she seemingly ends ups in the same place she was in AGoT! There are also numerous characters whom I think Martin wants us to be invested in, but we just aren't because they're either not too interesting or they get lost in this morass of a book. I'm sure some readers do, but do most of us care at all about characters like Asha, Victarion, and Euron? Even Theon/Reek got old by the second half of the book. And honestly, are we supposed to care about what happens to the the billions of people in Meereen like the Brazen Beasts, Stormcrows, Sons of the Harpy, Hizdahr, etc.? Everyone in Meereen, save a couple, are pretty much terrible people and I couldn't care less what their ultimate fate is. And let's talk about Quentyn Martell. He and his journey to court Dany get no little page time, but the only purpose he serves is to free the dragons. That's it. Now that's fine, but there was no reason for Martin to spend the chapters he did on him if he was a simple plot device. Lastly, everything in this series is miserable and depressing; and this is coming from someone who LIKES dark books and movies. But, my goodness, nothing uplifting at all happens. It's just one gloomy event after another and everyone is either angry, oppressed, or psychotic. Martin goes out of his way to ensure that absolutely nothing remotely pleasant happens. I understand there are books with such tones, but after nearly 5,000 pages of it, you get a bit worn down. I know a big appeal of the series are the ""gray"" characterizations, and I agree, but does nearly everyone have to be a murderous sociopath with no regard for human life? This worked in the first three books because we weren't sure what characters we were going to root for or against. But now, we know who has a shred of decency or not and the incessant melancholy is tiresome. This was the first book which I had to put down and read another book in between with before mustering up the motivation to finish. Usually, I'd just abandon a book I wasn't enjoying, but after reading 4,000 pages of the series I couldn't quit on it. Books 1-3 were fantastic. A Feast For Crows began the downslide but I figured it was merely setup. But ADWD was even worse than setup because NOTHING HAPPENS. I'm really torn over whether I'll read The Winds of Winter if and when it's released. I don't think I have it in me to read another novel like ADWD. I only started this series a few months ago, so I read all these books back-to-back (excluding the one I read three-quarters of the way through ADWD to keep my sanity), so I saw the decline of storytelling with this series happen in real time.","2017-07-10","United States","","true","64","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29SSLX8GUIP0F"

"B003YL4LYI","4","Yes, Words Are Indeed Wind: a Long Gale-Force Song","I've never ""reviewed"" a book that has harvested as many comments as this one has. What's left to be said? Well, an admiring comment and a kvetch, for the record. Simply to repeat what his admirers already abundantly know, GRR Martin is a great storyteller, indefatigable researcher and plotter - all the way down to the ground: his character files must be interesting - and builder of plausible worlds. What I think, though, is that for most readers, and certainly for me, it's the intricate political intrigues that captivate and that have pulled us through more than 4000 pages of narrative text. Martin gets power politics and certainly understands, probably at a doctoral-dissertation-research level, the late-medieval-world interactions of great houses competing for crowns that made such stimulating history and - add three dragons, a few giants, a large dollop of magic that's both creepy and creepily religious, and the palpable fear of the often mentioned, seldom-appearing undead White Walkers - that inspired him to build a world that perfectly contains these immensely entertaining, alternately shocking and howlingly funny, grand yet finely detailed, operatic, dynastic stories. But I ask his fans (and I don't follow the blogs or much of the online discussion of the books - I do like the Wiki, though, which serves as my character/place/backstory memory - but I presume this is a topic of intermittent discussion): doesn't Martin need either a significantly greater measure of self-control (as in 'mastering the ""Stephen King I-Have-a-Word Processor-Now Syndrome""') or a somewhat more ruthless editor (as in 'getting someone else to master the ""Stephen King I-Have-a-Word Processor-Now Syndrome""')? A Dance with Dragons, the longest novel in the series, is stuffed with filler - okay, fairly high-quality, intrinsically interesting filler - and is probably 15 to 20 percent longer than it ought to be. It's almost as though Martin has to overwrite and overstuff to in some way justify all those delays and blown deadlines. (I know: this is a churlish, and probably mistaken, point from an unreservedly grateful reader who should just shut his mouth.) But there are indeed long stretches of slogslogslog. A thousand-plus pages (okay: 959 pp of narrative in the hardcover edition) is a lot to ask of loyal readers, even given the fact that fantasy writers tend to have acute cases of generally justified logorrhea - I mean, it takes time to create plausible new worlds and thoroughly realized characters - but, jeez, a snip here, a clipclip there, and we could lose 100-150 pp. Can't we? (I appreciate, however, the 15 page or so cap on each chapter, which at least let's us get to the next episode in each of a half-dozen separate major narratives that are simultaneously unfolding.) Ah, despite and still...we of course eagerly await the next installment, and trust Martin has sufficient years remaining - hell, he's only 67, and 85 is the new 65 - to wrap up books 6 and 7 and even move on to an 8 in an adjacent piece of his Westeros and the Free Cities.

"B003YL4LYI","2","Plagued With Over-Description and Plot Inertia.","Disclaimer: I am not yet finished with this novel. I'm currently on page 579 and finding it very difficult to go on. There will be some spoilers pertaining to what I've read so far so read at your own risk. Now onto the review: After reading A Feast for Crows, I remember simply feeling disappointed and rather apathetic towards the book. Nothing of significance really happened and too many of the characters just felt like unneeded extras in a series that already has enough characters and houses to keep track of as it is. After the emotional rollercoaster that was A Storm of Swords, it was simply an uneventful disappointment. Looking back on it, I can't recall many significant scenes or plot events from it. With Dance, this trend unfortunately continues. Though the characters that we all loved who were absent in Feast have returned (Tyrion, Daenerys and Jon Snow), they all seem uncharacteristically static and just not interesting, and when Tyrion chapters aren't interesting you know something is wrong. It feels like they all got lobotomies since we saw them in ASoS. Jon sits around on the Wall, Tyrion gets hauled around like a sack of oats and falls off a pig and the once charismatic Daenerys suddenly becomes a passive damsel in distress who spends all her time second-guessing herself while pining for a mercenary all with the personality of a post. This is not compelling character development. And on the topic of Daenerys, am I the only one who completely gets pulled out of the story whenever one of her chapters pop up? Everything happening in Meereen just seems so far removed from the events at the Wall and Winterfell that I just don't understand why we're being told about it. I understand Dany's story arch and her significance as a character, but she's been doing nothing crucial to the overall plot for so long that her chapters are becoming a burden to the pacing of the series. At this point, we need to see her making some progress with her dragons and getting ready to head to Westeros already. Instead she's smashing a slave trade and falling in and out of love with a mercenary with the personality of a brick. She's completely regressed as a character. With a title like A Dance With Dragons, I thought for sure we'd see her character develop in some major ways, but nothing. What happened to make the three main characters so boring though? Maybe it was just me...So I flipped to a random chapter from ASoS and sure enough, the writing and pacing there were still as excellent and tight as I remember it. If Feast showed us one thing, it's spending an excessive amount of time on a novel does not guarantee a higher quality product. If anything, the opposite is true. Many felt Martin was taking his time to ensure a quality product, but just like Feast before it, it's the opposite. I think the reason behind the wait was Martin simply doesn't know where he wants to take the series anymore so he's stalling, and that's what a lot of ADwD feels like, stalling. Many reviews have already made mention of this, but it bears repeating. This novel reads more like a travelogue or restaurant menu than an actual novel with any meaningful progression. I've passed the halfway point and it's amazing how little character progression has been made. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Martin was being paid by the word. There's so much padding and simply meaningless rambling that I've been half-tempted to just skim paragraphs, something I make a rule to absolutely never do when reading. Here's a particularly bad offender from a Jon chapter that literally made me sigh upon seeing it. Located on page 219 of the Hardcover, it reads: ""In the granaries were oats and wheats and barley, and barrels of coarse ground flour. In the root cellars strings of onions and garlic dangled from the rafters, and bags of carrots, parsnips, radishes and whire and yellow turnips filled the shelves. One storeroom held wheels of cheese so large it took two men to move them. In the next, casks of salt beef, salt pork, salt mutton, and salt cod were stacked ten feet high. Three hundred hams and three thousand long black sausages hung from ceiling veams below the smokehouse. In the spice locker they found peppercorns, cloves, and cinnamon, mustard seeds, coriander, sage and clary sage and parsley, blocks of salt. Elsewhere were casks of apples and pears, dried peas, dried figs, bags of walnut, bags of chestnuts, bags of almonds, planks of dry smoked salmon, clay jars packed with olives in oil and sealed with wax. One storeroom offered potted hare, haunch of deer in honey, pickled cabbage, pickled beets, pickled onions, pickled eggs and pickled herring."" ...WHO. CARES. If this was an isolated incident of a bloated description, I wouldn't be complaining, but long-winded passages like the one above, particularly the ones describing food, plague this novel. Maybe they were in the first three as well, but there was enough plot development in those that I wasn't particularly bothered by them. The plot inertia combined with these overly descriptive passages that amount to nothing are simply trying my patience. Others have pointed out the ""Turtles"" paragraph as well, another offender among many. Another recurrance that's beginning to grow weary is the constant repeatings of certain characters' quotes. How many times do we need to read ""You know nothing, Jon Snow"", or ""Where do whores go?"", or ""Reek, Reek, it rhymes with Meek/Weak/Leek/Sneak, etc"", or the constant reminder that Tyrion killed his father while he was on the crapper. It was a rather major plot development, we don't need to be reminded of it in every single Tyrion chapter. This novel simply has no business being over a thousand pages. ASoS was longer, but the length never even occured to me because it was perfectly justified. Not so here. To be over halfway through the novel with this little plot development simply isn't acceptable. Nobody should have to slog through five hundred pages (or possibly more) of general fluff for some hope of meaningful plot advancement. As the old saying goes, ""Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, shame on you."" Despite the love I once had for this series, I won't be picking up The Winds of Winter until I read the reviews on it. If it recieves a similar reception to AFFC or this one, I'm done. I'll probably just look up a plot synopsis online. It was a good run, but it appears Martin's passion for this series has simply fizzled and died. I don't really blame him for that though, fifteen years is a long time to be working on a single series, but for him to discount all Amazon reviews as being ""sockpuppets"" insults the intelligence of his readers. I still hold the first three novels as some of the best in my collection, but unfortunately, I'm bowing out after this dance. It was a good ride while it lasted. I'll continue trying to find the motivation to finish this novel and possibly update my review to reflect my final verdict when I'm done, but with the first half of this collosal tome being as uneventful as it's been, I'm not holding my breath.","2011-07-26","United States","","true","67","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2570YR04IA6BV"
"B003YL4LYI","5","Finally... a return to the ""Ice and Fire"" series","""A Dance with Dragons"" is the 5th book in the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series by George R. R. Martin. The hardcover is 1040 pages in length while the Kindle e-edition is a 2119 Kb download. SPOILERS Within the first few chapters you'll be reacquainted with Jon Snow, Tyrion, Daenerys and Bran. Four important players that were absent or scarcely mentioned in ""A Feast of Crows"". The location of these four individuals is as follows... 1.) Jon Snow's story is at The Wall...probably my favorite tale. 2.) Tyrion's...travels through the Free Cities area...slow to get going but improved with time. 3.) Daenerys...at Meereen on the Slaver's Bay...a very slow tale to develop (to the point of thinking about skimming some of it). 4.) Bran...an interesting trek north of The Wall, with a less prominent role than the other three...one gets the feeling that there are important things in store for Bran in subsequent books. There were also several other individuals whose tales were very interesting, in particular Davos, (acting as the 'hand' for King Stannis Baratheon at the Isles of The Three Sisters and at White Harbour) and Theon (Lord Ramsey's prisoner). END SPOILERS In addition to this fine story, some other things I liked about the physical book itself... 1.) three maps: Beyond the Wall, The Free Cities and Valyria. These maps seem to have greater detail, giving information on names, places, distances and direction. [but see Cons: 1.a) below] 2.) an appendix in the back with an extensive Dramatis Personae...listing all the Houses (as well as lesser groupings), the characters within, their relationship to each other and sometimes, their present location. Concerns: Regarding the maps... 1a.) in the Kindle format the maps are almost illegible. And unfortunately they become more indistinct as you expand them. This of course in not a flaw of the book but rather the limitation imposed by the Kindle rendering process. 1b.) the three maps are hard to relate to each other. You have a vague sense of the geographic layout, but because there is no overall master map of the entire area, it is somewhat difficult to get a feel for the 'lay of the land' as to how the three maps provided are positioned geographically in relation to one another. 2.) Daenerys tale...slow to develop and repetitive to the point of being annoying. Conclusion: With the return of the major characters of the previous books, my interest in this wonderful series has been rekindled. A definite improvement over ""A Feast of Crows"", not only because the more important characters have reappeared, but the intrigue and tension so familiar with the first three books (with the exception of Daenerys story), has returned as well. Overall, despite the minor concerns mentioned above, I loved it...after a hiatus of many years it's been worth the wait. And not unexpectedly, Book 5 ends with many situations and developments hanging in the balance. 4 1/2 Stars.

"B003YL4LYI","4","Not his best, still fantastic","I'm a big fan of George R. R. Martin. Since discovering the A Song of Ice and Fire series many years ago, I've anxiously awaited (and awaited...) each new book in the series. I read his blog daily. And so I'm probably a little biased. Much has been thoughtfully covered in the preceding reader reviews, so I'll just offer up my 2 cents worth of random thoughts and anecdotes. Firstly, four stars. This isn't a perfect book. As others have mentioned, the plot perhaps meanders a bit, and the consistency of some characters can be justifiably questioned. And yet, from the perspective of this longtime fan, the sum of the parts remains as brilliant as expected. I savored each page, soaking up each new detail and happening, and anxiously tried to ignore the voice in the back of my head reminding me that it was one page closer to the end. The return to GRRM's world felt great! Prior to the release of this book, I was riding the subway and noticed a lady reading A Clash of Kings. I couldn't resist the temptation to reach out and ask how she was enjoying it. To my surprise (this was the first person I've met that didn't read and fall in love GRRM's series), she said she found it overrated compared to ""other"" books, poorly written, and aimed at the gender that wasn't hers. She also claimed to be a big fantasy fan, and when I asked which books she enjoyed more, she named only The Lord of The Rings. Hard to argue there :) I was reminded of this encounter while reading A Dance with Dragons. I've never thought of the series as being especially geared towards one sex or the other, but ADWD did seem particularly violent. Years have passed since I've read the previous books and I can't recall if they were as descriptively cringe-inducing. This is more food for thought for me than anything else. I'm certainly not bothered by it, and I'd argue that it adds to the contextual realism and depth of character in most examples. At the same time, it may give me pause before recommending this book to my girlfriend or that lady on the subway should we meet again. Lastly and leastly, while wading through reader reviews, I was shocked to find as much vitriolic negativity as I did. I have no worry with the 3 star average - as pure standalone fiction, this probably isn't as strong as the first books - but if you've journeyed this far, how can you not relish being back in this fantastic world that GRRM presents us? And what good would any review be without a little zany conspiracy theory? Here it is: it almost feels as if there were some collective campaign to spam this reader reviews section with harsh complaints and poor reviews. I enjoyed every minute of it and can't wait for more.","2011-10-03","United States","","true","69","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R367ABY28FA23H"
"B003YL4LYI","5","Great job","A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire, #5) By George R R Martin I can understand why this book took so long to write, and like the author I can say i have finally finished the book. I love knowing what happened to the characters, to find out that Jamie disappeared leaving his sister to face her accusers, and a trial by battle for her treason with out a her ""true"" champion. Seeing that Ayra lived and survived in her world is something i have been waiting for. I worry about John Snow, and how dynamic and graphic the last scene he was in.... now i hope i don't have to wait five years for the next book. finding out what happens at the wall, made the story more dynamic and dramatic. I love the knights watch and all they have to do to face the north the wildlings and the cold ones. Finding that Daenaries lived through the siege of Merrien, and how she was able to ride her dragon is so climatic that i can't wait to see how she is able to regain her armies. It was an interesting twist that the infant that was dead in all the other stories had survived, now i understand the subtle hints within the dynamics of the red keep. This is a great story, continuing and leaving the reader always wanting more, questioning about characters not spoken of in this book, and wanting to see what the next part of the story is..... Can't wait for the next story.... Great Job GRRM.","2024-01-24","United States","","true","70","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DKY9MS57DB9S"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Dancing With the Dragons","Contrary to many, I am overall pretty satisfied with George RR Martin's A Dance With Dragons. Does it have problems? Well, yeah, and some of those are huge. But is it the worst book of the series, deserving of the derision and vitriol that's been heaped upon it by lots of reviewers? Certainly not. Allow me to elaborate. I won't recount the plot here (if plot is even the right word...meandering at times, achingly slow and then devastatingly wicked at others); there's entirely too much going on. Most of the chapters are Tyrion's, Jon's, and Dany's points of view, but others surface as well, including Theon, Davos, Jaime, Cersei, and Arya. There were a couple of POVs I must admit to being puzzled by, but I have to hope that ultimately Martin will bring them to a satisfying intricacy with the main characters. Would I have loved to know what Brienne and Sansa were up to? Sure, but it's all right. We're moving along, however slowly, and lots of Tyrion is always worth it. Biggest complaints? Well, the pacing is off in the first two hundred pages or so, with way too much detail given to traveling woes and feasting items. In any other series, these would be deal breakers. Do I think Martin's editor was snoozing? Probably. Just because you are uber successful doesn't mean you should be allowed to enumerate every food on a table. My other big, huge complaint is that it had been so long since I'd read A Feast For Crows, I was LOST for a hundred pages. That's my own fault for not rereading, but I also lay some blame on Martin, since five years between books is inexcusable. What I liked? Lots of things.The dialogue is perfect and the intrigue is thick. We got vintage Martin with double crosses, lots of gore, and set ups galore. Loved, loved, loved Theon's comeuppance and what he does later in the novel; loved Barristan Selmy's honor; loved the twist with Rhaegar's son. I found what happened with Dany and her dragons distasteful, yet entirely plausible; I know that the bloodletting has only barely begun after Cersei's humiliation. And poor Jon Snow...always trying to do the right thing, but it's usually at the wrong time and with the wrong people. Martin's world is convoluted, overblown, and nasty, much like the world we live in today. His writing, however, while needing editing, still draws one in and builds suspense, causing me to continue turning pages and luxuriating within the boundaries of the Seven Kingdoms and Beyond. Personally, I'm invested for the long haul, even if A Dance With Dragons pales when compared to A Storm of Swords. It's not the comparison I try to keep in mind, it's the journey.","2011-08-17","United States","","true","71","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FED6UAHTTQJE"
"B003YL4LYI","4","a good book... but with a couple of very meaningful lapses","After thinking a little I have to say that I liked ADWD. I liked AFFC too, but would have loved them to be only ONE book. That being said, I'm talking about ADWD now... Arya, Theon, Bran, Barristan, Aegon/Connington and Jon 's chapters were a treat... they're all very well written and deep, they added meaning to the tale and lived up each and every of my expectations. They actually are what I wanted. As many pointed out, ""sadly"" the storylines all end at a cliff-hanger, but that's only to be expected, since we know there are at least another 2 oboks coming before the end. But there are a couple of things I didn't like at all... the Tyrion and Dany chapters seem to be the biggest problem with this new instalment. It seems to me that both characters have ""changed"" in a way that is unsatisfying . Tyrion in this book seems to have lost all his cleverness and, above all, his wit: I think here he has never said or done one single thing worth of the Tyrion we've known so far, he seem to have become a real freak and he he doesn't care... all he's interested in is to find out where whores go. Ok, he did what he did to his father, but he seems to have done nothing out of it except becoming a very plain, dull and predictable character which is exactly the contrary of what he has always been to the bone (he never ever surprised me, he sometimes BORED me instead - and I say that even if I liked his voyage!). The same, I think, happens with Dany. She HAD ALREADY grown from a little scared girl into a dragon (or a dragonling if you prefer) but now she wastes herself in not making her mind up. Never. On anything! Ok, she's a teenager and I understand all she did with Daario (which is very ""real"" as teenagers are concerned) BUT... but all the stuff she went through in Mereen without doing ANYTHING about it is, imo, out of character. I remember Dany becoming confident, learning from whatever happened to her.... and learning to make the best out of even the worst situations. She had become, in a way, strong. But here she does NOTHING (except marrying a man... and to think that she married him to heave some weight off her shoulders is almost unbelievable for what she had grown to be!!!) These, I think, are the real problem with the book: two major characters who don't quite resemble whom they have been ALWAYS, regardless of any situations they were put in. You may say now that people change. My reply is: yes, they change, but their DNA stays the same! And this is what I felt, that Tyrion and Dany's DNA have been changed without any ""strong-enough"" reason.","2011-09-18","United States","","true","72","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28XSABI99EFGJ"
"B003YL4LYI","3","Another disapointing entry in the series.","I've been a huge fan of GRRM's writing ever since I discovered A Game of Thrones all those years ago. I went on to devour A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords, as well as a bunch of his short stories and novellas. All of these works exciting and enthralling, so much so that I was willing to forgive the A Feast for Crows fiasco, thinking he'd right the ship in the next book. With A Dance with Dragons, well, consider the ship still foundering. Unlike so many other reviewers, I'm not going to criticize Martin for taking the time to describe all the foods encountered throughout the world of his novel. I actually think that adds a layer of depth to the world-building. I also think it's childish to criticize Martin's sex scenes as, and I paraphrase, ""the fantasy porn of a guy who doesn't have much experience with women."" Seriously, sex, food, setting descriptions...all those things in fantasy novels are like ads in magazines to me. If I'm interested, I'll slow down and pay attention. If not, I'll just skim through it until I get to the story. Some other reviewers have approached the heart of what's wrong with this book, and with AFFC before it. Characters travel and story-lines are moved into position, but the story doesn't really move forward. Lots of set up, things do happen, but nothing meaningful that gets the main characters acting upon each other. But I think the problem goes deeper. It's the characters, in my book, that are the problem. In the first three books, the main characters were involved in every single page, plotting to gain power and thwart each other. THAT was exciting. Some of them died, but their deaths made sense. Since AFFC, what I've been most disheartened with is the endless stream of characters that don't mean anything. For example, I could have gone through all these books without having to read a chapter from the perspective of any of the Dornish characters. Davos...? His chapters were interesting, but really? Theon's sister (can't even remember her name), Victarion, a Brazen Beast here, a Lannister uncle over there. It adds up to a whole mess of pages from characters I don't give a crap about. On the other hand, Arya gets a measly 2 chapters. Same with Bran. I can't even remember what happened to Rickon, and who knows where Sansa is now. Catelyn? Last I remember her, she had had her head sewn back on, but I can't remember seeing her since. And what happened to the other guy that kept dying and coming back, Berric Dondarion, I think? The sprawl has his this series hard. And I'm not sure GRRM can tighten it and bring it back under control. With ADWD, the problem is that I don't get to see enough of the main players acting in meaningful ways upon each others' plotting. I feel like the story hasn't moved since book 3. Just when things were starting to pick up in this book, GRRM pulls a frustrating little plot twist that's starting to get old. And the book ends. It wasn't all bad. I read it and continued to read it because I wanted to see where the story was going. Honestly, though, I was bored through the first 750 pages. I was more interested in the last 200. But then...well, I won't give the spoiler here. And despite my misgivings, I'm still going to read the next one. I'm holding on to this hope that these 2 last books were an aberration caused by the failed experiment of splitting two books by North and South. If he writes a condensed, complete 6th book, I think he can bring it back. Condensed in the sense that all the major players end up on the same stage (without all those minor characters taking up precious space), doing things that effect each other, and moving the story forward. From all his other works, I think he can pull it off. But he needs to do it quick, not another 5 years of waiting. And that brings me to my final issue with the series. I'm all for taking the time to write a polished product. But GRRM has taken that too far. I hardly remember a thing that happened in the 4th book, and only remember the major events of the first 3. Things get mentioned and referenced in this book that leave me drawing complete blanks. If Martin was releasing a book every 2 years, that wouldn't be the case. With all the time that has passed, the reader changes, and the story starts to lose significance (at least in my mind). So, if you've gotten this far, it's probably still worth reading. But don't expect any fireworks.","2011-11-08","United States","","true","73","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PFH6P9U19M3M"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Reads like a writer's database","I think if you put a Feast for Crows into a single interwoven volume with Dance with Dragons, and if Dance had been 200 pages longer, there is a fine story there. Without a doubt there are great story lines and good characters in Dance. What is lacking is any discipline on the part of the author to honor that unspoken pledge with his readers to ""get the whole story out there"" in manageable form. Just when things get interesting ... he ends it. Feast had too much action. Dance not enough. Put them together and I suspect they balance out - if you could ""sell"" the public on a 2000 page or so book. 7 volumes should be enough to tell the story. But at the rate plot development is going, it seems like at least 12 volumes will be needed, unless things get totally rushed at the end. I wouldn't care if Martin worked with a good writing panel (call 'em ghosts if you want) since he is a wonderful story teller (but perhaps not a wonderful writer). Then the ""database"" of character insights, backstory history, could be woven into a more compact, more disciplined book. Or books. Things I didn't like about Dance: Daenerys, the second best character in the series, seems incapable of being tough enough to rule, and ditzes around, then makes a horrible choice to avoid a war that is inevitable anyway. The ""real"" Dany only comes through in her last chapter.... We didn't get enough of Tyrion at his best, showing off what a wonderfully smart administrator and keen politician he is. Jon Snow is acting like he is 20 years more experienced than he is, but makes some incredibly stupid choices at the end. Arya, a really interesting character in the previous books, has chapters that seem ""tossed off."" What was arcane and mysterious, a ""girl's best adventure"" feel, that somehow seems mundane on this re-visit. This book is about a 3, Feast was about a 2, the series is better than a 5. In this case the sum is much greater than its parts, but I no longer have hopes that Martin will ever finish it. Clearly he has other projects (not only HBO) and at the same time he seems unwilling to take guidance from his editors and just get the book out there. On the other hand if he can get the next book out there in less than 2 years, he will certainly probably win me back. I mean Dickens and Dumas pounded out great pulp fiction, pulp fiction that was at the same time art, and Song of Fire and Ice clearly has that potential as well.","2011-07-26","United States","","true","74","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25INW1JR8GL4S"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Read the story for what it is, not what you want it to be!","I am a fan of this series. As a matter of fact, before purchasing this latest work, I re-read the entire series to get me back into the mood of the storyline. I have some points for those who find it 'boring' or 'stumbling' or 'too much'. First - GRRM has NOT changed his style. He continues to grip you with an amazing tale, granted a very long tale, that has the most amazing and in-depth character development I have ever seen. If you go back and re-read the series, you will find this DOES NOT CHANGE over the course of the story. What happens is that new characters are introduced and the tale becomes more complex. Second - If you don't want to read what is essentially and in-depth and amazingly colorful history, then don't! Sure, this is entertainment, yet it TRULY makes you think! The author is forcing you to remember and figure out that these characters are all acting independently along the timeline. The depth of the story (stories really) is truly awe-inspiring. Third - GRRM is bold enough to piss off the reader by simply making things happen. Characters die! Characters you LIKE DIE! BAD things happen that you DON'T want to happen. TOUGH! It's all a part of the story! IF you don't like that - then write your own story where everything happens exactly the way YOU want it to! I cannot even count the number of times I have said to myself ""I never saw that coming!"" This all feeds back into my first point! The Character development is amazing! In reality people change as they grow and experience life - these characters change in the same manner! It's truly gripping! Fourth - No, I don't find this to be a 'can't put it down page-turner' yet I found myself reading it every day. the story is gripping, the characters are amazingly human and honestly believable. They do things you don't expect, not because the author wants to piss you off, because they are very like real people! In the end, I find this series to be stunningly good. Continually. The biggest problem I have is I wish it would wrap up - I think a lot of us feel that way. Yet I will continue to read as we (hopefully) get another installment. The story did move along, many seem to feel it didn't move along enough for them, again, I say, let the art flow. If you don't like it, stop reading it. The end of the book very much sets us up for the next one and completely changes the game - again! Sometimes I think he does this just to be annoying.

At the risk of incurring the oh so ""insightful"" disses of my positive review from the trolling trolls going through and accusing the writers of robo-reviewing or of having been somehow monetarily compensated by GRRM for their having attested to liking his book, let me just say I loved this one. I guess I can take solace in the fact that my reading preferences jibe with those of the literati reviewing for the major publications and I can also take comfort that my reading preferences do NOT jibe with those of the ill-literati who have (apparently) nothing better to do with their time than endlessly comment on other reviews of this book. What's the matter guys, World of Warcraft lost it's luster? I can understand someone not liking a book; what I can't quite comprehend is someone making it their life's mission to excoriate the opinions of those who disagree. Who exactly is getting paid for what here???! As far as my review, as my rating shows I really enjoyed this book. Others have mentioned that the Dany chapters were meandering and draggy and seemed bogged down and I have to agree. That's the 1/2 star off for me. Otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed reading this one. I for one adore the descriptions of food and heraldry and muck and grime; it made the story very real for me and immersed me into the world GRRM has created. I especially loved how he counterbalanced the rich feasts for some with the desperate meals of horse-flesh or worse for others. The aftermath of war and the precursor of another war plus Winter coming are harsh realities felt more by some than by others at this juncture. Anyone else find the ""pork"" dishes suspicious? Both the ""roast pork"" Coldhands brought to Bran et al and the giant Pork Pie Manderly served up after the disappearance of the Freys? I also appreciated how much I started DIS-liking Tyrion in this one. He did something awful and his conscience is suffering and he is whinging away and self-pitying for a good part of the story. It felt very real to me and it was very well done. The surprise introduction of another contender for the throne was also a lot of fun and I really loved the Varys bit at the end. Oh no he didn't! Can't wait to see the fallout from all that! The book felt to me much like the opening of a chess game with all the pieces being moved into place for the big finale. I, for one, am hopeful that the finale lives up to the build-up. It seemed an impossible task to pull it all together in the end, but even though AFFC shook my faith a little, this one restores it and I am going to be waiting a few more years I'm sure to see how he starts wrapping it all together.","2011-08-16","United States","","true","76","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2W25AC93R71WT"

"B003YL4LYI","3","More menu than Dance","I read a lot. I read a lot of fiction, non fiction, classics, literature, manuals, blah, blah, blah. I own thousands of books. when i was younger I would read a book through no matter how bad, as I have gotten older and had more demands on my time, I've realised the folly in this so gladly toss aside a book that is worthless and shun authors who have disappointed me too often. I might read Winds of Winter if it comes out and if I have not decided to read something else at the time. I enjoyed a Game a Thrones and a Clash of Kings and a Storm of Swords. I slogged through Feast but could not re-read it. I struggled through Dance and will not waste time re-reading it. I could give a synopsis of this 959 page book in less than 5000 words and none of them would be used describing the menu or the wine or the beer. This series suffers from the lack of a decent editor who would look at the pages and cut them by 75% and tell Martin to tighten things up, to get to the story, to dispense with tricks and cliff hangers and, again, get to the story. Feast showed us the story had gotten away from Martin. Dance shows us he is still not sure what to do, where to go, how to proceed. Both Feast and Dance could have been combined, as was originally planned, into one book and that book could have been less than 500 pages and we would have cried out for more rather than plodding through a tired replay of feasts and argument and schemes we've seen many too many times before. A good editor would have kept Martin focused on the story but editors lose the spine when an author becomes popular and they let any old POS get published as long as there is a ready audience to snap it up and cry for more. I came to the series late. I got Game and Clash for $4 as single book. I bought Storm for $6ish, I believe I paid $12ish for Feast and I pro-ordered Dance for around $15. My initial $10 investment was sound. My later $27 was not. Others have said, nothing happens in this book. I disagree. We get about 100 pages of story. The problem is that there are 959 pages in the book and teasing the story from these pages is tiresome work.","2011-07-14","United States","","true","78","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1W6GLJBKFG429"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Pampered, aren't we.","(I am Hungarian, excuse my English) I checked some reviews down there and it appears that GRRM's latest dance with dragons has been received with mixed feelings. Well, my two cents go to GRRM, I say this book is great, as great as any of his works -- it's just slightly different. To my taste, these changes may even lift the book above the other sequels. I saw complaints about slow storytelling, uncharacteristic characters, and even, horribile dictu, boredom. I don't want to - since I can't - measure out justice in the case, fantasy is not an objectively measurable genre, nonetheless, I would remind readers about two points that might be worth considering while assessing this book. * The Ice and Fire saga moves a vast number of characters around the board. I imagine it is quite some challege for the author to balance between expectations of readers who yearn for action-packed, intricate stories and of those who wish to see characters grow, develop, process - or just simply react to - events. Work on details or move ahead, might GRRM ask himself day by day. I think he did a fairly good job. Lots of things are going on, and we see characters change. Thoroughly. Or die. Latter one a trade mark of GRRM. * (spoilers follow) What happened to Tyrion, a giant spirit in dwarf body, so that he lets fate drag him around, mostly against his will, to random places, or seemingly nowhere in particular? What hit the Kingslayer so that he often broods, pats people on the shoulder, saves ugly maidens, forgives insults and makes peace instead of war? I am telling you. They are subject to GRRMs world order. A prince is prince in his own realm, yes. And becomes a slave or game piece if extracted from his fortified settings. Looses vigour when aging, loosing his sword hand, or facing the fact that his paramour twin cheats him and makes efforts to ruin their whole lineage. It is a game of thrones, man, get over it. Would it be more amusing to follow the ""traditional"" pattern? Deus ex machina tricks and cheap shortcuts? I don't think so. Gods are dead in GRRM's realm. They don't rush out and save you with flaming swords and mirror-polished armors. One of the reasons I like GRRM's world is that wounds hurt, characters pay the price of their follies. No one plays the game of thrones in god mode. To sum it all up, I am desperately waiting for the next book and pray for good healt to GRRM so that we can enjoy his books in abundance for the foreseeable future.","2012-05-08","United States","","true","79","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MH7RU7MWT7KO"
"B003YL4LYI","3","Many years in making but not the masterpiece it could be","For starters, I wasn't one of the fans who waited six years for this book. I got into A Song of Ice and Fire (aSoIaF) in 2009 and read every book that year. I would say I didn't let the hype and anticipation get to me especially when A Feast For Crow (AFFC), in my opinion, was the weakest entry into the series. It was still good but the limited focus on the Lannister Twins and a slew of unimportant characters shrunk the world of aSoIaF and made the story feel more like a campy soap opera set in the middle ages. The cast of characters got too big and too spread out so it would seem Martin choose a divide and conquer style by devoting many chapters on a few characters as oppose to before when he would advance the plots of many characters all at once because they were clustered to gather in a handful of settings. I expect this trend to continue in the next book until all or most of the players are consolidated on Westeros. I don't have a qualm with this approach as long the characters are doing things that advances the story and that's just one of the problems with A Dance with Dragons (aDwD) The stars in aDwD are Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen (Dany), Tyrion Lannister and a few others I won't spoil. Martin knows readers were curious about them were more than upset when such character favorites didn't make it in AFFC--read the post script by the author. Martin delivers on the sheer amount of devoted on Jon, Dany, and Tyrion at 14,10, and 12 chapters respectively. Fans rejoice, right? Not quite so. Let's consider Jon and Dany first then Tyrion. While Jon's chapter is not as thrilling as it was when wildings and wrights were crashing down on the Night Watch, it is still entertaining nonetheless as Jon tries his best to adjust to the leadership role thrust upon as Lord Commander. Jon's chapter are supposed to parallel Dany's chapter as they are two young people from great virtually extinct houses trying to lead a people. Comparisons end there for where Jon stumbles Dany flounders. To put it bluntly Dany's chapters are boring. It's almost like reading the same chapter 3 or 4 times. The Yunkish slavers test Dany, her council quarrel with each other on the best way to handle the Sons of the Harpy and the wise masters. Some advise brute force, other advise compromise if not outright submission. Dany chooses the less confrontational approach like taking hostages and hope for the best. The plan fails and we start again. She is provided with an ""out"" twice, that is leave Meereen for good and head to Westeros, she turns down both offers opting for the honorable route and fix the mess she's caused except she doesn't fix anything and her final recourse was a giant step backward in terms of her beliefs and efforts. Oddly enough, it is not until she is forcibly remove from Meereen that her subplot actually goes somewhere but that's towards the end of the book. Last we have Tyrion. While Jon and Dany have always been uncertain about things, Tyrion as always been a man of action, save a few incidents done in the heat of passion, Tyrion is a man of good sense too. Tyrion's chapter are somewhat of a chore to read. In other books he may pine after Tysha from time to time and have fits of self pity and self loathing, in aDwD it's all the time. He too gets sweep up in the plot restore House Targaryen and finds his way to Meereen to meet the Dragon Queen (Dany). His subplot gets derailed as soon as he gets within Meereen's borders. He looses a sense of himself and becomes complacent with being slave entertainment. He returns to his old schemes when he plans and exit strategy out Meereen. Meereen or what some fans call the Meereenese knot is just terrible for it seems to suck the life out of every character and bring plot advancement to a standstill. ADWD would have been a whole deal better if the chapters about the slave cities were shorter. Despite some of the misgivings I have about the main characters aDwD is a good read.Structurally it could do with some clean up with the syntax and horrid repetition in some parts. Some characters with lesser chapters were goog--the character arc for one of them was phenomenal. There is a point of view (or maybe two depending on taste) that book could have easily did without. In the world of aSoIaF there are two phases: buildup and execution. To the dismay of many fans out there aDwD is a buildup book. It starts more new threads than resolves issues brought forth from the previous book. However, words are wind. Pick up a copy and judge for yourself.","2011-08-17","United States","","true","80","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZA6ARLZQ1ZUK"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Better than Storm, but not enough Bran...","Martin's latest installment in his epic pulls in the reigns a little bit, taking us out of the hot mess that is Westeros (for the most part), and finally starting to stitch the eastern and western sagas together through use of traveling characters, bonds of alliegance, and revenge... It becomes clearer and clearer that, though magic is flowing back into the world because of Danarys' children, such power is no simple thing to control, and exacts prices that individual players in this ongoing game of thrones may not be willing to pay. At least, not by themselves. Though I would call their stories the most compelling of the lot, we hear comparatively little of either Bran or to a lesser extent Arya. I am not sure if that means there will be more focus on them as intensely magical and pivotal characters in the future, or if they will slowly decay back into dust if and when the Targaryan queen loses one or all of her dragons. All the focus in 'A Dance With Dragons' seems to be on characters who are striving now, traveling now, working now, on the fringes now, but for all that arguably more important due to their rangings. Fortunately, that means Cerci Lannister is finally set to cooling her heels. For those who have said here that one feels more softly towards her at the end, I must whole-heartedly disagree. She deserved much worse, and more, suffering than the measly pittance meted out. I have no problems with who she may choose to sleep with in the books, despite personal feelings at odds with incest... But she is nasty, callous, powerhungry, and more than a little stupid about the way she politics. Frankly, I'd like to see her thrown in a blender with old weasly lord Frey and made into dragon slurry inch by bloody inch, but Robb Stark died two books ago as meet proof that I don't get what I want here, though I'm quite happy to continue reading, anyway. I think we finally have the beginnings of the rise to peak, though, in a narrative that's already some four thousand pages long and counting, even denoument will likely take a book's worth of pandering... But in the immediate future, there's this whole sloppy Slaver's Bay war to deal with, and with the flux galloping, much and more could easily change the whole tangent of the saga. I just can't wait to see the dragons once more on the move, and if HBO gets its' way, we'll see the next novel soon!!!","2011-08-02","United States","","true","81","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JUR3B9WN073"
"B003YL4LYI","5","A pleasure after the slow paced previous one...","That's what reading reviews on Amazon can do to you... I had been enjoying with strong enthusiasm the serie up to the fourth where I started struggling with lesser characters, too much of Cercei and a lack of the more interesting ones. Then I started checking about it on Amazon and a very good review started to give me doubts. It stated that the serie was very unlikely to end due to the very slow pace of writing of Mr Martin. As I was tired by my reading of the fourth, I did put the reading of the fifth on standby. What a mistake! In fact, ""A dance with Dragons"" fits in the serie perfectly well. I won't spoil anything which means I won't say much by consequence about the story. Enough to say that Jon, Tyrion, Daenarys, Arya are here again. There are many very nice moments where my heart started beating faster. Let me assume that you have read up to the end of the fourth at this stage. I will state that ""A Dance with Dragons"" is the complement of the fourth as books intended to set the stage properly before continuing with the story. I do personally like the writing style of Mr Martin so I won't complain about him taking too long. I guess it is a question of taste, if you want a fast paced serie, this one may not be for you. I do enjoy when the story stretches, specifically when the characters are interesting. It creates a kind of intimacy for me with them. Do not get fooled by believing that nothing happens in the book. The story develops itself in many different directions, some kind of expected and some absolutely not foreseen by me. If my memory is correct and if there have not been any updates since the last time I checked, the six one is supposed to be a few years after the end of the fifth. I am impatientely waiting for it, I am still afraid it may take the author as many years to write the next book than for this one. This means five years!!! Hopefully, HBO's interest may lead him to increase his pace but I am just speculating. Conclusion: If you have come up to the fifth book of the serie, you cannot be anything else but a fan. Or you like torturing yourself... Anyway, if you were disappointed by the fourth and its lack of really interesting characters, this one will restore your enthousiasm.

"B003YL4LYI","3","Worth the wait?","Like so many other fans, I've waited a grand total of 5 and a half years to read this book. While there are many theories as to why it took Martin this long to pump out this sequel, the fact of the matter is that this book weighs in at over 1000 pages, exceeding even the massive A Storm of Swords. This many pages dedicated to A Song of Ice and Fire should be a boon to any hardcore fan of the books, in theory. But did it deliver? I've got a somewhat simple rule when it comes to novels... the longer it is, the better I expect the book to be. In a world where an author demands this much of my time, their story had best be worth it, because there are always other books worth reading out there. The first four books, in my opinion, were all well worth the time. Did this one follow suit? The good news: + Martin still meets his high standards for level of detail, and his world breathes as strongly as it ever did. In retrospect, I wish I would have brushed up on the happenings of the first four books again before tackling this one. 6 years is a long time to have to remember every nuanced character and noble family crest and lineage, and who fathered what bastard, etc. But it's all well worth it. More backstory on many, many characters, and we even get more slices of history, such as parts involving Robert's Rebellion (Honestly, if Martin had the time and inclination, I'd love to see a novel on this part of Westeros history). + If your favorite character was missing from A Feast for Crows, they got center stage here. Tyrion is a personal favorite of mine, and he helped carry this book for me, even if his character arc in this particular novel was well below the standards for Storm of Swords (Though to be honest, that is a hard act to follow). Daenarys also plays a major role (Well, the title sort of makes that obvious, I suppose). The bad news: - The POV character selection in this book is, by and large, about as organized as a ten year old's closet. As Martin himself states in the foreword (I only mention this to make it obvious I'm not spoiling much, if anything), some characters from Crows do pop up later in the novel. And they do. But each of them only gets one or two chapters, where not too much actually happens. Honestly, I'd have much preferred if he had left these snippets out and simply added them to the next book, rather than giving us tiny updates on characters that don't even really address anything that happened from Crows, with one exception. But, having read the ending, I can understand why he felt compelled to include what feels literally like a tiny slice of the next book. And then, he brings in 3 new POV characters. As if he didn't have enough already. I understand the need for one of them later in the book, but another one only gets one chapter. I didn't get a chance to feel like it built any continuity with them, and when that happens, they feel unnecessary. - Not too much actually happens in this novel. It's brutal, but the truth. Oh sure, some characters are left in peril, and others meet unfortunate ends. If you're a fan of this series, you already knew this was going to happen. But Martin spends almost all of those 1000 pages hyping three major conflicts, and where does the book end? Right before we learn what happens in any of them. I've heard stories of how Martin has struggled more and more to wrestle this story of his into prose, and I'm inclined to believe it. I know he's a big time veteran author with his own hit HBO series now, but the fact of the matter is that he needs an editor to help him pace his story if he really desires a return to the quality of his previous books. Bottom line: Was it worth it? Yes and no. Yes, because it's more A Song of Ice and Fire, and because this book sets up The Winds of Winter to be one of the most exciting books in the series. No, because this book feels like nothing but filler and cliffhangers, when it should be able to stand on its own merit. I can only hope this dip in quality can be rectified in the next book, and even more importantly, that I won't have to wait another 6 years to find out.","2011-08-10","United States","","true","83","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2169PN8TSYZYO"

I have just read all 5 in a row, reading Dance for the first time, and it is now my second favorite behind Storm of Swords. Nothing happens in this book? I know everyone's impatient and we all hate waiting years for the next installment, but TONS happens in this book. After being warned about it for 4 books, Winter has finally arrived, and with it many iconic moments, lots of pieces moving around, more trials and tribulations, more death.

"B003YL4LYI","5","Ignore the bad reviews...","[Pre-Review Rant: One thing is certain when it comes to a truly good epic fantasy series like this one. The longer the series goes, the more the author does NOT repeat himself, the more complex and intricate the plot becomes, the less each book stands alone, the more thought provoking each installment, the more popular, the louder the most critical fans will proclaim their discontent.] A Dance with Dragons feels more like the first book of A Song of Ice and Fire's second major arc than a sequel to A Storm of Swords. The first arc, depicting the War of the Five Kings, took up the first three books while A Feast for Crows is both an epilogue to the first arc and a stepping stone into the second arc. Dance builds off the world Martin created up to this point and takes it in a whole new direction while still staying true to all that has come before. This is my favorite book in the series so far. Well worth the 6 year wait, but then again, I've always felt authors should take their time rather than rush, but maybe that's just me. Dance is, in turns, funny (I laughed out loud more times during this book than any of the previous ones combined), heartbreaking (should I be too much of a man to admit I cried, cried like a baby?), awe inspiring (there were multiple scenes that left me breathless), frustrating (in a good way), frightening (okay, I'll stop with the parentheticals now), epic, adventurous, mysterious, and every other thing that an epic fantasy novel should be. The plot is steeped in history and political intrigue, the characters pop off the page, and the settings leave you almost breathless in their beauty. And, of course, Martin does what he has always done best. He keeps you guessing. Just when you think you know what's going to happen... Psych! I'm not going to put any spoilers in this review. He takes characters we know and love and then plays boggle with our heads. People we despised before suddenly become sympathetic, while people we once loved supremely get on our nerves. He also brings into the forefront new characters who are every bit as entertaining as the ones we've lost. The only real criticism I have when it comes to A Dance With Dragons is the pacing early on. I got over that quickly enough, though, when I thought of it as the companion novel to A Feast for Crows. While I read, I always tried to keep in mind what was happening in Feast at the same time. I hope someday GRRM comes out and releases A Feast for Dragons or A Dance with Crows and puts all the chapters together into one volume as they were originally meant to be.","2011-07-28","United States","","true","85","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RX8BP2B6SRZPB"
"B003YL4LYI","3","Love it overall but not the ending","I absolutely love these books! I have not come across anything like it! It has everything you could want in a book with only a bit a dramatic emphasis lacking. At times the author gets too caught up in details that do not matter, at least to me, and he starts to lose me for a bit. However he usually grabs me back in quickly. The last two have been riddled with way too much unnecessary info and not enough meat. SPOILERS BELOW so DO NOT READ if you have NOT read or finished this book..... SPOILERS: POV/Characters - I love the story and the characters as a whole. Character you just adore and ones you love to hate and then those you just aren't so sure of. I enjoy how the author writes the chapters from different character's points of view but I don't care for the time in between them or the volume of characters . Too many to keep track of and I start to forget where he last left off with them and this is with me reading the books back to back. I can only imagine how it has been for those that have been on track with the releases. Plot - WOW! I love the suspense of not really knowing what is coming next but the author should tread carefully with this or he will become too unpredictable by half. He adds too much of stuff that does not matter and too little sometimes of stuff that does, at least to me. I feel at times the drama is lacking with that ""Moment"" nowhere to be found - death of Ned Stark and how his family reacted, death of Robb & Catelyn and how each family member found out & reacted, ""death of Bran & Rickon....... I can't quite put my finger on it but for lack of better description I find the author lacking in emotions which I feel you need in order to keep attached to the story. I don't really need all the detail of guts & gore. Having watched the TV show somewhat helps in the dramatic emphasis department. For example, the Red Wedding was more dramatic on screen than how he wrote it. This author is NOT lacking in the imagination department though and I love the mystical magical part of it! Deaths-ok as I stated, I love the unpredictability of this author and how you never know what is coming...HOWEVER, if Jon Snow is really dead then I believe he will have become predictable at that point. Can someone other than the honorable Starks die off?! Yes a few retched characters have met their demise but not enough in comparison to the ""good guys"". Jon's death would be the worst thing the author could have happen. Jon is such a wonderful character and he seems way too important to the storyline as a whole that it would be senseless to kill him off. He is by far the best character in the entire series to date. Longclaw would be useless? The importance of the direwolves would really start to go away. The mystery of who his mother/parents are would seem pointless. The Author would lose a lot of credibility with me if he is actually dead. To draw you into a character for so long, make him seem so important and then just kill him like that without finishing his story would be a big waste of the story. But alas, I do not actually think he is dead. He will remain one of the most important characters to the end. I believe the title of the series, A Song of ICE and FIRE, is telling. Length of & between the books - Length of books-GREAT! Keep the story coming! Length between releases-horrible! I have just found this story and am now all caught up realizing that I might have to wait a few more years for the next book to come out... really? This will be torture! BTW-for those of you theorizing that Jon Snow is the son of Lyanna Stark & Rhaegar -- I love it! Jon Snow is KEY in this story! And I LOVE the shows choice of actor to portray him! :) Ending - DID NOT LIKE the Jon part - especially since we have to wait so long to find out his true fate. In general the ending with Danaerys, et all was anticlimactic.","2013-10-08","United States","","true","86","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EKO0M4NKH58"
"B003YL4LYI","5","An improvement to be sure.","This book was a pleasant surprise. A Feast for Crows was my least favorite installment of ASOIAF. A Dance with Dragons was a much more successful outing for George. I had some trouble through the earlier chapters, as I usually do with these books. Painstakingly boring details at times, albeit necessary details. Things really picked up in the second half of this work, and I couldn't put it down. I thoroughly enjoyed the chapters from Selmy's pov, along with Reek/Theon. The Ghost of Winterfell chapter was an unexpected surprise that brought a bit of mystery to the table. It was also really fun to read all of the differences in this book from the TV series. The writers of the series seem to have followed the book very little. This gives me great hope that The Winds of Winter will be far more entertaining than seasons 6,7 of the show. I would recommend this book to any person who enjoys fantasy, who has read the books that come before it, and especially anyone who was disappointed in the fourth stallment of the series.

"B003YL4LYI","1","Tolkein he is not","The point of this review is to give you, potential reader, an honest and fair review of a series you've probably heard a lot about, but not enough to decide if its worth the money to buy, and the time to read. I have suffered through all 5 books at this point, and will attempt to describe briefly some high points (there are a few), and the low points (there are many). Then, you can hopefully use this information to help you decide for yourself. High points (such as they are) - Martin obviously loves the world he writes in. He has created an intricate, detailed version of Medieval Europe and the Middle East, and is very dedicated to enriching that environment and making it as immersive as possible for the reader. A few of his characters are well developed (not all, or most, unfortunately - read on). Martin tries valiantly to imitate some authors he obviously admires (JRR Tolkien - beyond using the double-R in his name, some scenes, character details, names, places, etc are obvious hat-tips to Tolkien - I find that trait admirable, even when the author in question (Martin) is so far beneath his idols in terms of writing ability). And once in a long while, Martin will succeed in writing a scene which is almost worthy of publication - while certainly not inspiring or thrilling, it may at least be mildly amusing. But that is where the high points end. If I had to do it over again, I would not spend the money or take the time to read these books. Now, usually, when I make that decision, it's because the books are merely poor literature - the writing is bad, the authors abilities are poor, or the plot is mundane. While all 3 are the case with Martin and this series, these books are not merely poor literature - they are offensively poor literature. There are 3 major reasons for this. 1 - Formulaic plot (when it exists): All 5 books so far, but especially this one and book 4, suffer from the utter and complete lack of plot, and worse, what little plot does exist is utterly formulaic and predictable. Those who believe the series boasts ""cliffhangers"" and ""unexpected turns"" simply haven't spotted the formula - and that's curious, because the formula is simple and rather obvious. First, Martin will introduce characters which fit (more-or-less) into classical ""good and evil"" stereotypes, and a few which are ambiguous but likeable. He will develop these characters with the intention of making the reader hate the ""evil"" characters, and grow attached to the ""good"" characters. The few ambiguous characters are used to ask shallow, mundane questions about existence: ""Can ugly people be likeable?"" ""Does good always win?"" ""Is honor and virtue important in life, or will it just get you messed over by the bad guys?"" I suppose George finds these questions absolutely mesmerizing, but unfortunately most of the rest of us discovered the answers by the time we reached puberty. 2 - A shallow fascination with ""going against the grain."" Now that Martin has good and evil characters, and bored us with these stupid, sophomoric, and transparent questions, he will attempt to shock us all by killing the ""good"" characters in meaningless and trite ways. Those characters with the highest morals, greatest honor, etc, Martin kills in the most mundane ways - sometimes by a mere accident, but more likely at the hands of one of the ""evil"" characters. Martin, apparently, is attempting to reassure us that ""power corrupts"" and ""only the good die young."" Again, Martin apparently thinks these stories are ""real"" and ""gritty"" and ""bold"" for ""daring"" to kill off the major characters that way, when actually, they're just boring, formulaic, and predictable. (By the way, one side effect of this ""shocking against the grain"" writing is the we readers never get attached to the ""good"" characters after he kills the first one or two. As a result, we find ourselves totally uninvested in the story itself). The evil characters, on the other hand, usually live prosperously, but may occasionally have a sudden (and most unlikely) change of heart, becoming ""good"" themselves due to some off-the-wall Deus ex Machina. In that case, they'll soon die of an accident or at the hands of one of the ""evil"" characters. 3 - Gratuitous, graphic sex and violence. Lest you roll your eyes, stereo-type me as a prude, and assume that I am simply bashing all these books for this reason alone (making up the other points or embellishing them), let me assure you that I have no problem whatsoever with sex and violence (graphic or otherwise) when it serves the story. Both should be used to advance the plot, develop the characters, illustrate the culture in which the story or set, and so on. The problem is that in these books, the sex and violence do none of these. Instead, both are used as a cheap trick to sell more books; sex and violence seem to exist as an afterthought and are thrown in whenever the author believes he needs to keep the reader's attention (which is actually somewhat perceptive, since he fails so miserably to keep our attention in other ways). That means that the books have now been degraded to cheap porn - and if it's cheap porn one wants, why read through thousands of pages to get it? All of this combines to insure that, while I will not only refrain from spending any more money on anything else that Mr Martin writes, I actually took the time to give you, the reader of my review, a bit of information which may help you to keep from making the same mistake I made. There is far better fantasy literature out there - thousands upon thousands of pages of it. Spend your money, and your time, on it - and pass these horrible impostors on the genre by.","2013-02-18","United States","","true","88","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNTP1OLATLVBQ"
"B003YL4LYI","3","10 years since the last good book... Don't get hopes up","Ah, where to begin? I'm going to try to focus on the actual book and leave the George R.R. Martin bashing to a minimum. But I will say that this man has seemed to become the most ungrateful author I've ever stumbled across and apparently he just does not care that 'fans' like me, who've been there from the beginning are upset about his disregard for his own great story. We feel betrayed. Betrayed! If you ever visit his website, all he does is whine about the people who can't wait to read his next book. God, we are such jerks... After waiting 5 years for a book that was supposedly written at the same time as the last, but just made it too long for one book... I guess I have at least another 5 years for the next mediocre part of the story. Argh - I digress! And please note, I do not have direct spoilers, but I may let you know not to expect too much from certain character story arcs... The story is better than the last, A Feast for Crows, because at least things DO happen in this book. For some characters. I actually did like the plot revolving around an old knight. I love reading about the backstory from before the series begins. You have great sympathy for this wayward knight who has kept his loyalties and friendship even after death. Bran has finally continued his adventure and met an interesting outcome. Still not sure where this is going, but I enjoyed reading about him. Those were the two, and only two, highlights of this book. Theon was interesting for a minute. Dany is completely useless and annoying - not the girl-woman I've grown to admire and root for. Jon is whiny, clueless as to why no one supports him, even though he asks for advice and does the exact opposite. Tyrion is funny, as usual, but his part could have been cut off just like his nose. The Martells make an appearance, leading to an interesting story....which fails to materialize; it was not that interesting. Arya is in the exact same place doing the exact same thing as in AFFC. I realize that these people have to get from A to B, and yes I want to know how, but I don't want to know EVERYTHING! I felt like I was reading AFFC with different characters (note: this is NOT good). It's like Martin is trying to make us dislike our favorite characters. And not in the good exciting way he showed in the first three AMAZING books of the series where the good guys had flaws and the bad guys had their reasons and some just rightfully looked out for themselves. No, it's like he is completely bored of them... His writing and his current personality trend almost make me wish he would just stop and I will finish it all up myself in my mind. Speaking of poor writing - the writing was horrible. As you can see from my review, I'm no copy editor or author myself, but even I know drivel when I read it. I was soooooo incredibly tired of hearing the phrases repeated throughout the book. ""He/She was not wrong"" ""As useless as Nipples on a breastplate"" ""Die with a smile upon her lips"" ""words are wind"". It's like the George R.R. Martin template. These phrases were repeated three or more times, and when you note one, you note them all. It was very distracting. Yes, Martin has decided his story his boring. It's glaringly obvious. What is not obvious is if he is so bored, why is he dragging the story out? Not to mention - Has he learned nothing after Jordan's death just before the end of his story? Does he have so little respect for his fans? I am giving this a 3/5 because it is most definitely worth the first read. However, it will not be joining his five star first three books, which I've read repeatedly and marked parts or stories of interest; instead, it will be holding up my bed posts along with AFFC...","2011-11-15","United States","","true","89","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVXNQLZ2N1ETD"
"B003YL4LYI","4","Backlash Not Deserved","I liked A Dance with Dragons, and had no problem with its pace. It couldn't move too much faster than A Feast for Crows, which happens concurrently. So no, there were no climactic battles or massive slaughters that turned the whole story in a different direction. But there were plenty of surprises, and lots of build up to what should be a terrific volume six. We caught up on favorite characters missing from A Feast for Crows, and got to know some terrific new characters, if only briefly in some cases. The plot did move forward, and some key characters died or met with setbacks, while others arose to new prominence. The whole thing held my interest just fine, perhaps because I didn't expect anything overly dramatic. I think the other reason this book has experienced a backlash is that fans are now worried the next volume will take another seven years. I'm not sure that's true, first of all, since the story is now caught up and the stage is set for widely dispersed story lines to cross again. Martin seems to have worked out the problems with his overall plot, and I'm hoping that means the next volume will flow more smoothly. And secondly, well, I'm not sure it's fair to criticize an author for taking so long to perfect his work. The good thing about taking so much time to finish the next volume is that I could revisit all the previous volumes like old friends before reading the new one. Martin pulls off a neat trick by creating a world full of greys, supposedly blurring the distinctions between Good and Evil, and yet it is fairly easy to point to the characters for whom we root. Three of those characters seem to be the subject of a prophecy, but it wouldn't surprise me if Martin figures out a way to make that prophecy bittersweet even for the characters who seem destined to survive in some form. Despite all the contrasts between Song of Ice and Fire and Lord of the Rings, I think Martin is quite concerned about morality, and about just how far characters will go when morals pose a barrier, and what it does to them to violate their own codes. Anyway, I'm willing to bet that Volume Six will bring the strands back together and will be published in less than three years. If nothing else, Martin needs to keep ahead of the TV show!","2011-07-25","United States","","true","90","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU8RX0RRKHGMF"
"B003YL4LYI","5","I loved Dance, one of my favorites","I am a huge fan of Martin since the first time I read him back in the nineties. Just like everyone else I was disappointed with book 4. It was written well but didn't seem to go anywhere and Cersei and Jamie chapters aren't near as interesting as the chapters of the characters in Dance. So I was excited to read Dance and yet anxious because I wasn't too sure what I was going to get: the writing of the first 3 or the writing of Feast. Gladly, almost right from the very beginning, the Martin of old has returned to us. The characters are gritty and real. Some are good, some are bad, and like Martin of old good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people. We get to watch Jon as he struggles to control the Night's Watch and come to terms with what he is struggling with beyond the wall. I loved his chapters probably the most of the main characters. Tyrion's grew on me, although I didn't care for them as much in the beginning. Daenerys also grew on me, although I wish her chapters would have had more resolution and moved the plot forward more. In the end you can tell Dance is setting up the greater climax in the coming final 2 books, but it at least had my interest from chapter one so I didn't mind that the plot didn't move as much as in the first three books. I was entertained for all 950 pages and left wanting to read book 6 even more so. If only Martin would hurry up. I mean the HBO series is going to be producing a series a year, so Martin must have some idea of where his final two books stand in relation to the HBO series. A definite recommend. 5 stars. PS As a side note, I am amazed at the number of 1 and 2 star reviews. I think it is a direct relation to how long it took Martin to come out with Dance and the fact that Feast left something to be desired. Readers went in to Dance jaded and completely ruined their perspective of where Martin was and where he is now. And what's with the 1,000 word reviews? Honestly, I've never seen a book with so many people, from 5 star to 1 star, writing novellas about it. Does anyone honestly ever read a review when you have to scroll down the page?","2011-08-26","United States","","true","93","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20ZL8BO905ER6"
"B003YL4LYI","5","One Epic Story","I'm not quite sure how I'd rate this book as a standalone story if I wasn't already enthralled with the overall Epic Story (and all of the substories that fashion it). I am lucky in that I started in the series about 6-8 months prior to ""Game of Thrones"" being released on HBO. I found it at the top of several lists online for great fantasy books and reluctantly gave it a try. I hope I don't have to wait 6-8 years for the next one like some of you did for this one. I read some of the reviews complaining that the book might be ""running to stand still"" (moving along for 1000+ pages but not ever getting anywhere). To me, any continuing series is a bit that way. If the stories ended at the end of each book, then each book might as well be its own unique story. As is, the stories continue from one book to the next. Having said that, one would hope that some things would be resolved in so many pages of story. I think in an epic series, some of the sub-plots should be at least apparently resolved with others possibly being left open to the next book. It is probably true that this book is a bit more open-ended with less resolution than the others. I can't imagine trying to keep a somewhat parallel time-span (i.e. with the previous book) in some parts of the book while accelerating through time in other parts of the book and keeping it all straight. I think the POV and ambiguity of time helps. I saw people complain that he wasn't true to his ""shades of gray"" character types and ""anyone can die at any time and be really dead forever"" mantra. To that I ask, if he has to unpredictably kill a main character or two in every book, is it really still unpredictable? Isn't it then more unpredictable to not kill one? Without giving spoilers, this book made me care about some characters I hadn't previously liked as much. I hope they don't die anytime soon. Despite any criticisms, the Epic Story, as it continues from book to book, is fantastic. This book is quite enjoyable. I don't know that any of the others made me want to rush to finding out what was going to happen next to a character more than this one did. Too bad, you don't always find out in this book but as long as the next one isn't too long in coming, that will be fine.","2011-09-16","United States","","true","94","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LYL8OXEYIASE"

"B003YL4LYI","2","I can't believe I read the whole thing","I read all five books of GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire in quick succession. I can only say that I was totally disappointed in ""A Dance With Dragons."" After a prologue (which at best was confusing and accomplished nothing) 71 Chapters, and an epilogue the question must be asked: ""Where's the beef?"" ""A Dance With Dragons,"" really makes me wonder if GRRM's heart is really in this series anymore. Simply put, A dance With Dragons is a one thousand page epic of dull, dragging, incestuously self-referential, cliché-ridden language, soap-opera style narrative in which nothing significant reaches any kind of conclusion. Also, that I can do without the voyeuristic sex and the explicit detail of bodily functions and parts in endless details about bowel movements, Wildling penis size, peeing, frozen snot and on and on. That type of ""gritty realism"" detail detracts from the story for me and is not necessary. The first three books were excellent. Rich in detail and well written. Then came ""A Feast for Crows."" The plot bogged down and did not move forward. Not to worry said I. Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind experience the same issues with The Wheel of Time and The Sword of Truth series before they righted their series ships. Surely GRRM would pay heed to the criticism AFFC received and pick up the plot and move it forward at a much faster pace. Unfortunately, Not only did he not pick it up, he kicked it into the basement and plot movement ground to a virtual stand-still. Jon essentially spends 13 chapters moving the Wildings south of the Wall and worrying about food only to get the Ides of March treatment from four of his Crows. Why spend that much time developing a character only to kill him off. Well maybe now we will at least be rid of Mormonts stupid raven screaming ""corn, corn, corn,"" every other sentence. With the death of Jon Snow, GRRM has managed to kill off every character I had any feeling for. Well Catelyn is still around after her rather bazaar resurrection. So is Arya, but I have no clue what she is turning into for the Many-Faced God. Daenerys, Mother of Dragons spends her 10 chapters holed up in the cesspool city of Mereen and dithering with palace intrigues and fighting a guerilla war with the Sons of the Harpy--only she never does any fighting, just takes casualties -- for the whole bloody book, while everything falls apart around her. Well she does have several steamy bath scenes with some of her ladies...HBO ought to love them. Bold, adventurous Dany who I though was on her way to Kings Landing turned into an abusive mother who put her children (the Dragons) in chains and turned into a hand-wringing, indecisive soap opera queen. And that brings me to Tyrion who also got 10 chapters. Our friendly dwarf spends his time making cynical comments to minor characters on a boring journey in which he ends up on a sinking ship with Ser Jora who is taking him to Daenerys. In the next Tyrion chapter the slippery half-pint appears on the slave block in Mereen along with Ser Jora. Ahhh could it be that he will finally be able to ally himself with Daenerys? She could certainly use his help at intrigue. But no, the Dragon queen flits off to never never land on the back of her black dragon leaving us with several chapters of Ser Barristan agonizing over everything and nothing. He does take Daenerys husband, who is also the King of Mereen, captive. To what end we kind of never find out. Unfortunately in GRRM's world, all the good guys die only to be replaced by simpering, directionless, two dimensional, uninteresting characters that are sent on never ending journeys. If anything bad can happen to the good guys, it does. I can also do without the GREAT amount of senseless killing, rape, torture, disease, etc. that seems to dominate all of the books, but especially dominates ""A Dance With Dragons. But it's not just good guys GRRM kills off. The arch villain Tywin Lannister also gets deep-sixed by Tyrion leaving the plot with no real antagonist of any consequence. Cersei might have filled that role had not GRRM not use her two chapters to debase her into another whiney paranoid soap queen who spends one whole chapter walking naked through Kings Landing. I guess you could make Roose Bolton into an antagonist...he and his bastard psychopathic son Ramsay make a good pair...but other than gratuitous rape, torture and mayhem they are shallow and two dimensional. So who is left? Errrrr.... The line up on the Protagonist side is not much better. Daenerys is about the only major player left from Game of Thrones. Well there is Theon Greyjoy...but he has been made over into the unheroic Reek. Then there is Bran who spent his three chapters learning to talk to trees and sliding in and out of the bodies of Ravens, his direwolf and Hodor. So after five books we are left with no clear-cut protagonist or arch antagonist. As I said earlier I don't think this series will ever be completed. If GRRM does write another book it had better be on a 2-year cycle not a 5-year cycle. In conclusion I don't like ""A Dance With Dragons."" It was not a good read for me. I say this in the face of a large number of reviews and critiques that rave about GRRM's A Song of Fire and Ice series being ""Adult Fantasy."" I can honestly say that I agree with them as the coarse language (how many degrading ways can you say vagina), numerous rape and sex scenes, the obvious pornographic BDSM of the slaver cities certainly earn a XXX rating in my opinion. It is gritty reality at its unbest, but I can already see the HBO execs drooling over it. But to me it is a complete turn-off as was the book itself.","2011-08-23","United States","","true","97","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RT8PZHYB1IVRE"
"B003YL4LYI","5","Mesmerizing","A Dance With Dragons is fifth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series and I am hooked, lock stock and barrel. In this installment, the first 60% of the book covers the same time period as that covered in a Feast for Crows but focuses on things taking place outside of Westeros -- at the Wall and beyond and in the Free Cities. The last 40% sees the two parallel tracks merge together and move forward. The immensity of the vision required for this series is beyond belief. New characters continue to be introduced, including a few that likely will be central to the plot moving forward. Although this book lacks the relentless plot punches of the third installment, Storm of Swords, there are enough jaw-dropping moments to satisfy even the most blood thirsty, including two unforgettable scenes involving the dragons. Among the things I love about this series are: (1) complicated, three-dimensional characters that can be loved (or hated) with passion; (2) intricate political intrigue with endless twists and turns; (3) an amazingly vivid, original fantasy world with more nuances than you can count; (4) heroes, villains, underdogs, vipers, champions, animals, feats of valor....the list goes on and on. The unforgettable characters in this series include: Jon Snow, bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark and the current Lord High Commander of the Night's Watch, desperate to wear the mantle of power with honor and grace; Arya Stark, Jon's half-sister, hidden in Braavos while she learns who she is and where her destiny will lead her; Danaerys Targaryen, Blood of the Dragon, gathering power and the strength to take back the Iron Throne ripped from her family in blood; Tyrion Lannister, the Imp, exiled from the Seven Kingdoms after being branded a king- and kin-slayer, hunted by his evil sister Cersei, mother to King Tommen, for whom no amount of power would ever be enough; and, of course, the animals, including Ghost, direwolf and familiar of Jon Snow; and the three dragon ""children"" of Danaerys -- Dhrogon, Viserion and Rhaegal. All of these and many more are woven into the intricate tapestry that is this series. I could read these books forever. Opening the cover and starting to read is like diving into a deep pool and feasting your eyes on an aquarium of the most amazing creatures you can imagine. I can't even fathom how George R.R. Martin keeps the worlds, people, histories and back stories of each and every complex character straight. If he keeps going for 10 more books, I am in.","2011-08-18","United States","","true","98","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O4TK3BISNYXG"
"B003YL4LYI","3","Spinning Its Wheels","I have greatly enjoyed this series up until this point, the first three books I adored and while I thought Feast for Crows was slightly disappointing from my favorite characters not being in it, i found it very interesting and compelling and things actually happened. Ok, I'll start with the pluses. The characters are still extremely well written, well rounded, and all around believable in their actions and motivations. The multitude of plots seem to be condensing and moving towards several central hubs of activity and there are finally indications that the big looming threat might actually be about to occur and people in the book are finally starting to take it seriously. Also, there is far less graphic sex in this book. Game of Thrones, Clash of Kings, and Storm of Swords had the scenes of sex make sense, the informing and formative moments for the characters and virtually all made sense in the narrative. Feast for Crows, however, got rather pointlessly gratuitive at times, so I am glad that Martin seems to have heard the complaints of this and toned it down to Game of Thrones level of actually being important and character defining. Now for the negatives, my biggest complaint about the book is that so many of the characters, though still well written, just seem to spin their wheels. The previous four books characters, P.O.V. especially but others as well, learned from their mistakes and experiences(or at the very least changed because of them), they moved and they grew in sensible ways, that was the biggest triumph of the previous books. In this book, many characters just seem to go on and on and on about the same thing and regardless of what happens, they don't change or grow, they just sort of spin their wheels like they are stuck in the mud. This relates to the second problem which is that until the last 200 pages of the book, very little happens, there is lots and lots of talking and debate, usually the same ones every time the same P.O.V. character came back up, but nothing actually gets done. This is saying something especially with the Wall storyline, in which despite it being dead obvious that something is coming, the reaction of some people to the threat is essentially to stick their head in the mud and argue the same points of(essentially) protocol and don't actually do much of anything. My biggest problem with the book is that on reaching the end of it I can honestly say that for the first time I don't even want to venture a guess of where the plot is going or how things are going to end up. I am all for keeping things a secret but I am so completely in the dark of what is going on that I am honestly not sure that Martin himself actually knows what the endgame is anymore. The problem, I think stems from the fact that the characters long ago seem to have taken over the story and rather than altering the plot to make it fit with how the characters have turned out, the plot seems to be back with a vengeance and is now at 'war' so to speak with the character arcs. On final note of annoyance, for me, is that Martin has to know by now that the writing of this is moving a good deal slower than he ever planned(he has admitted as much) and if he wants to take breaks to work on other projects, well, as far as I am concerned that is his prerogative, but with all of that in mind he STILL has several big, dramatic cliffhanger endings which made me very frustrated on getting to the end since I know I'll have to wait YEARS to see the resolution. Final Summation: The book is well written and the characters are still good, but honestly I was bored by large parts of it and it seems like not much happens and nothing really changes.","2012-04-03","United States","","true","99","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38DDN7TUP9B6R"
"B003YL4LYI","4","What were you expecting?","I understand most of the reviewers point about how in terms of the storyline this book did not move it along. However, we all knew this years back and this should have not been a surprise to fans of aSoIF. We all knew 'A Feast for Crows' and 'A Dance with Dragons' were actually suppose to be one volume but was split up due to size (but let's be honest it's probably due to $ also). So to go into this book and expect something different is totally insane. It's like opening a can of CocaCola and expecting it to taste like Dr Pepper! To penalize this book's quality/rating because of this is unfair. If 'A Feast for Crows' and 'A Dance with Dragons' came out in back to back years this would not even be an issue. I agree with most fans that GRRM is taking way too long to finish this series, the first book came out in 1996 so it's 16 years and counting as of this review! Perhaps if he didn't get sidetracked with so many side projects he would have finished years earlier. The gaps are so long in between each book that I have to lookup Wikipedia what happened in the last book. GRRM is doing himself and his series a disservice with his slightly faster than snails pace writing because people have lives and as time goes on so do our interest and attention span. Now onto this book's review, it once again showed why GRRM is truly a great story teller and how much time and effort he puts into the complexity of characters and storyline. I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it yet but there's a character who we hate because he betrayed the Starks (in book 2) and yet in this book we root for him to escape his captors. This character supposedly really 'Reeks'. A good writer will make the reader feel engaged and emotionally invested in the story and characters and GRRM does that better, if not the best, than many current authors. This book does move the story along for other characters such as Tyrion (my favorite) and what happened to him since he murdered his father. It just doesnt move the story along in terms of the entire series but hey that's not you were expecting right?","2012-01-26","United States","","true","100","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U0DRHYGEWKDL"
