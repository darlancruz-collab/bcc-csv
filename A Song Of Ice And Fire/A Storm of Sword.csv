"B000FBFN1U","5","A Solid (and Huge) Installment that Leaves You Wanting More","It's impossible to put these books down. As soon as I finished ""A Clash of Kings,"" I had downloaded and began reading ""A Storm of Swords."" It follows the example set by the previous book in that it expands upon the plots and themes already established, adds a few more layers to keep things interesting, and somehow manages to be better than the book that came before it. Spoilers follow. It wouldn't be possible to adequately sum up everything that happens in this book in an appropriately succinct manner, so I'll just give a brief, bare-bones overview. Westeros is still caught up in the war raging for the Iron Throne. With five claimants competing to rule the Seven Kingdoms, it doesn't look like there's an end in sight for the violence and destruction. Things are also brewing in the North, where the Wildlings beyond are organizing an attack to break through the Wall, overwhelm the severely undermanned Night's Watch, and invade. Meanwhile, in the East, Daenerys continues to amass resources to aid in her plans to attack for the Throne. She moves through the cities of Slaver's Bay, gaining support and exercising her growing authority as both the Khaleesi and the Mother of Dragons. I'll start by addressing perhaps the most obvious characteristic of ""A Storm of Swords:"" it's huge. Granted, if you downloaded it for your Kindle like I did, the monstrous size of the novel might not be as immediately striking, but you'll undoubtedly notice pretty quickly that it's over a thousand pages long. Books this long tend to be one of two things: unnecessarily descriptive with plenty of filler to pad out the pages or complex with an intricately layered story that fills the pages with content. I'm pleased to say that this book is definitely the latter of the two possibilities. It would perhaps be feared that the middle book of a lengthy series, especially one with a humongous page count, would be repetitive and full of fluff and padding, serving only to lengthen the series and sell more books. Again, that simply isn't the case with ""A Storm of Swords."" The plot doesn't stall at all; in fact, every chapter moves the story forward and works to develop the overall plot. The story is exciting with so many power players devising and implementing their own schemes as well as the war raging over the Iron Throne. Martin has a lot to say about his world, which makes for a fascinating story and guarantees that none of the thousand-and-some-odd pages are boring. With the pace being consistent throughout the novel, you'll be flipping through pages with the desperate need to know what happens next to your favourite character or faction. For the first time I can recall, I finished a thousand plus page novel thinking that it wasn't long enough! Martin's story is so enthralling, unique, and captivating that you'll want more than even a book this long can offer. I'll also note that the story is far from predictable. I've mostly given up trying to guess what will happen because the actual events typically far exceed my predictions. I'll probably end up mentioning this in every ""Song of Ice and Fire"" review, but I ended up taking a bit of a break from fantasy due to being frustrated with the same plots and tired clichés that seemed to crop up in every book. Martin has actually managed to write not only a unique fantasy novel, but a series that stands above many others simply because he strays from the commonly tread path. Pretty much anything can happen to anyone; good characters aren't given immunity and bad characters aren't doomed to death (and really, calling characters good and bad isn't completely accurate since most are various shades of grey). The plot twists and turns like crazy, but it's handled deftly and the author clearly knows where he's going, putting the reader an exciting ride and a gamut of emotions. And just when you think you've got it figured out, something comes up that throws your predictions out the window. It's a nice change from being able to guess everything before it happens, as tends to be the case with other books in the genre. It's well established by this point that Martin doesn't shy away from the violence of war...and ""A Storm of Swords"" practically has blood dripping from its pages. With the war for the Iron Throne in full swing, the death count in this book is high. The horrors of battle are portrayed in all their gritty glory; these aren't nice people and they don't do nice things. As I've mentioned in other reviews, neither the violence nor the sex present comes off as gratuitous (for the most part), but instead works to flesh out Martin's world and reinforce the concept that no one is safe. Yes, this is the book with the Red Wedding. There are a couple weddings that take place, so it's not immediately obvious which one will be THE wedding if you haven't already been informed. And yes, some well-loved characters meet their end in this bloodbath, families betray one another, alliances change...all the jazz that one can expect from such an event. There are also other grisly surprises that determine the fate of some, well, not as well-loved characters. In the East, Daenerys is faced with the brutality of slavery and the effects of anarchy as she conquers the Slave Cities, and it's not pretty. If you were bothered by the dark content of the two previous books, you probably shouldn't read this one because the author has really upped his game in that aspect. Personally, I'm of the opinion that the grittiness adds authenticity to the world, but I've always preferred a darker, more realistic setting. While I usually don't find the sex and violence in these books to be gratuitous, there is one instance of it that I'll have to complain about; and weirdly enough, it's probably one of the more ""normal"" sexual relationships we see in the book: Jon and Ygritte. I totally get the significance of Jon breaking his vows with Ygritte, both in terms of his background as a bastard and as a member of the Night's Watch, and I enjoyed seeing him struggle with his conflicting emotions on the matter. However, I got a little tired of reading about them getting it on in detail multiple times every night. Sure, a few times is fine to give us an idea of Jon's situation, but the frequency came off as really unnecessary. Of all the gruesome things one could complain about in this novels, that's what stuck out to me as being gratuitous and over the top...who'd have thought? The characters just get better and better with each book. That's not to say they necessarily become better people (in the brutal world of Westeros, that almost never seems to happen), but they definitely grow and become more intriguing with each installment. With so many storylines and characters, it would be easy to shove a couple off to the side, but, again, Martin seems to have this under control and every character is more than adequately fleshed out. The changing point of view in each chapter works well because it ensures that every story and every character continues to move forward. Each chapter, and therefore each point of view, is in some way significant; I never finished a chapter wondering what the point of it was or what it added to the story. The characters continue to be portrayed in shades of grey, each one unique and changing and none of them fall into the typical archetypes. You'll be frustrated with some and cheer on others and, as I mentioned earlier, some well-loved characters (and some that we love to hate) meet their ends in ""A Storm of Swords."" You never know what the characters are going to throw at you (or at each other, as the case often is) or who's going to make it out alive...and in a book as brutal as this one, that certainly adds a level of suspense and excitement. ""A Storm of Swords"" adds Jaime as a point of view character, and he quickly became one of my personal favourites, especially with Tyrion's viewpoint also being maintained throughout the book to provide a different Lannister perspective. Jaime is an incredibly nuanced character and begins to undergo a lot of change in this novel, and much like Tyrion, he walks the line between protagonist and antagonist, never really being one or the other. With his background and unique perspective, I hope we see Jaime as a point of view character (and, indeed, that he survives whatever the next books throw at him) in future books. This is also the book where certain characters began to stand out to me as being just plain annoying and, surprisingly, boring. As I've mentioned in my other reviews, ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" is so great partially because different characters will resonate differently with each reader, so your favourite character may be someone else's least favourite. As I was reading this book, I found that the character that tended to make me groan aloud when I started a chapter and saw his name was Bran. That's not to say he's a poorly written character; he just doesn't really appeal to me. Perhaps it's because there are so many other plot lines to focus on, but I found him and his story to be a tad boring. I don't doubt that he and his quest will be significant since he's one of the few characters that encounters magic (a rarity in this world), but his position as the wise, future-seeing, up-and-coming mage just doesn't interest me personally. Despite my couple complaints (which are really more personal in nature than anything necessarily ""wrong"" with the book), ""A Storm of Swords"" is a solid entry in the series. It takes the themes and plots from the first two books and builds upon them to create a novel that is better, darker, and more intriguing than the first two. The plot is still steadily moving forward, building momentum and adding layers of story with each book. With the cast being as massive as it is and the number of storylines being many, I find myself wondering how Martin will tie everything together. He's proven to be a capable writer so far, so I'm sure he'll figure it out. At any rate, this monstrous book is one Hell of a good read. Five stars!","2015-04-01","United States","","true","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28XPM71HR3ANX"
"B000FBFN1U","5","For the classical and fantasy reader alike - complex, gripping, exciting, multifaceted... sublime.","If you despise fantasy fiction, READ THIS ANYWAY. GRRM delivers a RARE series - a sophisticatedly written series - it is both mature and complex at every level, and manages to do so without tedium, but quite the opposite. I've found myself hardly able to bear moving to each successive chapter to follow a separate storyline or character due to the gripping story in the one I was reading. But as I switched gears to the next ""nugget"" in this grandly woven tale, I found myself equally enthralled by THAT storyline. As far as the cast of characters - it is vast. And character development is sophisticated. You have a vast range of personalities, motivations, biases, vices, scheming, hurts, etc. You watch upon a stage where the marionette has directed their interplay so intricately it is a believable plotline that echoes real life as action and schemes between characters collide. And as time moves forward in the story you experience those characters exult in victory, seethe with hatred, quail in defeat, rage in frustrated schemes, and hope against hope. Not only that - but they grow with their experiences. Their motivations can at times be complex scheming or simple earthy passion (whether that be angry violence or lust or daydreaming). The stage is set with a great cast as well - both men and women each with their subtleties and unique persona. Not every woman is a damsel, just as not every man is a hero - which is fantastic. As far as the politicking - it is multilayered. You have Lords and Kings vying for position, status, power, peace, justice, or vengeance. This through marriages, treaty, war, subterfuge, assassination, etc. You have the character level politicking where personal vices come into play whether that be noble or ignoble - rooted in either their sense of duty, selfishness, naiveté, or other. Its just so varied and rarely formulaic or repeatable. I can't necessarily say there are plot twists in the traditional sense of the word (where one can almost feel the author shout 'got ya! - didn't see THAT coming eh?' to the dumbfounded reader). The machinations of each character in this vast stage - competing and colliding with one another's - and that ends up speaking for itself. The reader may cheer or curse depending on a particular turn of events, but that has more to do with the efforts of one party or another succeeding against all others. It's a dose of near-reality. Plans win and fail - and there isn't an overarching ""blessed"" subset of characters. It is extremely refreshing and entirely spellbinding. As far as action, magic, and monsters. There is very little compared to what one would expect in the scifi fantasy paperback novels. There are clashes and contests. There are strange creatures and powers, yes. But this isn't your summer 80s Schwarzenegger/Stallone action flick. This is a sophisticated story that has such content in its proper place and not gratuitously. There is fighting but it's not center piece as a simpleton's hack and slash hero-save-princess-defeat-demonprince novel. Nor is this series meager on action. There is plenty - yes there's fighting, but there's also violence, there's action-y physical feats, there's sex. Sometimes it can be raw brutality, exposing the crueler and despicable side found in humanity (torture, rape, etc). GRRM doesn't have wizards bouncing around making things blow up like ""Tim the Enchanter"" nor do we have some wondrous creature at every turn. The reader will find that yes - magic and monsters do come on stage, but it's not the centerpiece, obviously. The good vs evil hero's saga akin to Tolkien is great. One will find store shelves littered with lesser versions of that, and in much simpler format. GRRM is on an entirely different track - where multilayered politicking vies against the striving of characters good and bad. Wars, fights, loves, plots, etc - all go into a great tumbler. The protagonists (assumedly so because of their nobler aspirations) don't necessarily win. Plenty of characters whom the reader may come to empathize with may be frustrated (even killed). It's part of the reason why the series is so exciting to read - you are never assured of how things will turn out. As for myself - I am an eclectic reader. I've enjoyed writings from Hawthorne, Nordic sagas, Homer's Iliad, Shakespeare, Cervantez (Don Quixote), Jane Austin, Dickens, Tolkien, Chaucer, Vonnegut, Alexander Dumas, Michael Moorcock, Victor Hugo, to LRHubbard, etc. If you've enjoyed any of the authors as such listed above, TRY this series. I believe you will be pleasantly surprised. It is very well written.","2016-07-11","United States","","true","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11OTJ4DVT12G6"
"B000FBFN1U","5","review written halfway thru book 3; now i'm done - best in series so far","As my review for Book 2 says, I love the way the books changes perspective from chapter to chapter so that the reader really gets inside the heads of the characters, providing insight into the complexities of human relationships in a way you otherwise wouldn't. More than it is a ""fantasy"" novel, it is a pseudo-history, and as we all know, history told from only one perspective is skewed and incomplete. Martin's choice of multiple perspectives gives a very thorough view of what's happening and allows the reader to reach their own conclusions about what is good/bad, right/wrong, desirable/undesirable. Although I'm a fan of the tv show, believe me when I say: THE BOOKS TELL THE STORY ON A LEVEL THE TV SHOW COULD NEVER EVEN DREAM OF ACHIEVING. The books also provide a good balance of pure pseudo-historical adventure story with subtle fantasy elements without being too in-your-face fantasy. At the outset, the kingdom of Westeros believes magic and magical creatures no longer exist except in very subtle holdover ways, like the occasional witch-type character, but those are a rarity and viewed skeptically. As you move thorugh the books, some of this supposedly dead magic turns out to be not so dead, but it's not like a Dungeons and Dragons world where trolls and wizards run amock. So it doesn't have a ""kitsch"" problem the way some bad fantasy novels do. Now for book 3 specifics: We're still focused on the Stark family in many ways; as I hypothesized in my Book 2 review, the Starks seem to be the true focus of the overall story. But other major players on the chessboard also become near and dear to the reader. In book 3, as the title suggests, we cover the ""war"" of the various figures vying for the throne and a fair amount of plotlines are ... resolved. S*** goes CRAZY up at the wall, and Jon is becoming more and more of a central character, which I like since he's an underappreciated bastard and I tend to root for underdogs. I absolutely love where Arya's story is going as well, and at the close of her last chapter in Book 3, I believe I shouted ""Yeah!!!"" at the top of my lungs, much to my dog's consternation. Book 3 ends with a lot of balls up in the air and I'm dying to see how this all comes out. As far as actual literary value, I have no complaints. The prose can sometimes be plodding with detailed descriptions of people's clothing (do I really care where the silk came from?) or the various courses of a feast (yum! but let's get on with it), but for the most part it is artful and eloquent. Like Stephen King, he spells out the dialectic quirks in dialogue which makes voices come alive and makes the world they're in feel more real (poor uneducated people and fancy rich people speak differently? hey, that's like real life!). He uses historical vocabulary a lot, which has made me grateful for the Kindle's built-in dictionary at times, but I think speaks to the level of research and preparation that went into it. I'm sure that if I really put my mind to it, there would be phrases or pages that I could slash with a red pen, but only very few, honestly. Even the tangential moments - during which I am anxious to get back to the action and find out what happens next in the grander scheme of things - have a purpose and feel necessary even in the moment. The story is thorough to a ridiculous degree, but this makes it feel more real; it is so holistic in its attention to detail (in both physical descriptions and emotional/psychological insight) that you can't help but believe this all happened or is happening somewhere, somewhen. Ah, verisimilitude. It's not a love story, although there is some love. It's not a true war story, despite the battle scenes, there is no identifiable hero or villain (there are definitely a few heroes and villains though) and there is no particular ""quest"" except maybe ""achieving leadership who will protect the realm"" (but that's a pretty lame quest if you ask me). With humans fighting humans while a supernatural threat looms in the background, it could become more of an ""us against them"" in some later book, but that's not really the groundwork I think the author is laying. It feels more like just a context for a foray into the virtues and pitfalls of humanity. It could just as accurately be called ""A Game of Good-Choice, Bad-Choice.""","2013-04-14","United States","","true","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KCJADSFU3G0Q"
"B000FBFN1U","4","The Last Great Game of Thrones book...","A Storm of Swords is my favorite book out of the Game of Thrones series, followed by the first. The second frustrated me for various reasons, but primarily because George RR Martin (GRRM) is not writing the typical fantasy that we have come to expect, which is equally a good and bad thing for me. Other reviewers have detailed the prominent features of GRRM's style--killing off heroes, extreme tragedy with little justice/resolution, mixed senses good and bad, differing and even opposing views on the state of the world (this flows in to plot, for example Tolkien's LOTR had a single motivation driving the plot, stop the Dark Lord, but in the Game of Thrones books, there is never a single threat or solitary evil force that masses and threatens all, each character sees the world and the world's threats and needs differently,) etc. In many ways, GRRM strikes a compelling blend of tragedy that keeps readers on their toes and mimicks reality. He is excellent at providing characterization, plot intricasy, politics and politcal manuevering, believable motives and twists. He can make you love people who you previously thought were scum (e.g. Jaime Lannister). He has a way of undermining what you thought was true about the GoT world. And he certainly is not shying from breaking with conventions of any sort, even to the point of building certain plot-lines and movements within the story only to shrug them off until they are seemily insignificant. He creates plot-lines and characters only to do very little with them (the Starks), he builds up certain elements only to do little with them, allow them to fade in to the background, like the Others, with who he provides almost no development in the first two books and then (from what I've read) *spoiler* essentially does nothing significant with them in the following two (books 4 and 5) save allow their shadow to cast fear on a small group of characters (Jon, Stannis, Sam, etc). Annoying though it may be, there is some amount of genius and attraction in GRRM's constant bucking of conventions such as these--creating ominous signs and warnings only to let them fizzle, realistically mimicks life where doom and gloom and fearmongering is common on a colloquial, conversational, level, but rarely pans out (think back to May 21, 2011 and the end of the world warnings). If he is indeed using this strategy of sorts to build up expectation and then mimick the real world letdown when the hero or the magic, miracle, doom, etc, doesn't manifest, then he is being quite clever. He does seem to integrating the real world into his story arch, where life is underwhemlimg, complex, tragic, unfair, where some things hoped for never materialize and are forgotten. Still, for all we know, he could be buy drawing out the various threads that will all bunch spectacularly up as the series closes. It does seem that GRRM is obsessed with moving his characters around in a politically charged chess match, at the expense of some of the other plot-lines he introduces and more traditional Fantasy genre elements. And he does this sort of intrigue quiet well. To summarize, GRRM almost lost me with book 2, reacquired me with this book, but then lost me with books 4 and 5. I am as frustrated with the lackluster, disappointing direction GRRM has taken the series AFTER this book. Up to the third book, the story is magnificent, if not begrudgingly so, and it is well worth the read.","2012-01-08","United States","","true","4","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OM6F3MWKSEOS"
"B000FBFN1U","5","Storm of Swords a great ending to the first trilogy in the Ice and Fire series","Review will contain MINOR spoilers The song of Ice and Fire is book series that encompasses a total of six books (technically seven although the fourth and fifth are pretty much one book split in half) and this is the third book in the series and it offers the closest thing to closure and answers to a lot of the stories that have been started, while also continuing some and beginning others that will presumably lead to the end of the series. There are 12 POV chapters in the book (10 main characters, one prologue and one epilogue). The most important plot lines that the book covers are: 1.) The Wall. If Storm of Swords belongs to any character, it probably belongs to Jon Snow. I'm afraid to say that in the last book I was starting to become bored with Jon's story and the story of the watch in general. It started to get a little repetitive to me with all of that wandering around beyond the wall chapter after chapter and the leader's of the watch like Mormont and the Halfhand and their constant warnings about the danger beyond the wall. Now we finally see it. Jon was captured by the wildlings at the end of Clash of Kings and it opens with him being introduced to Mance Rayder, the king beyond the wall. Jon's plan to spy on the wildlings is complicated by Ygritte, whose Jon's feelings for become harder to ignore and Rayder's constant questions of Jon's allegiance and the state of the watch. Needless to say, a confrontation between Mance and The Watch is brewing and Jon's got to figure out how to warn the Watch and whether or not he wants to. Through Sam, we also get to see the other danger beyond the wall; the Others. The Others continue to stalk the Watch as they make their way back from The Great Ranging and you finally get to see their power and some of their abilities. 2.) The War between The Starks and The Lannisters. When main character Ned Stark was executed by King Joffrey in A Game Of Thrones, it kicked off a war between the two powerful houses that divided up the realm. After his father's death, his son Robb was anointed The King In The North by his father's bannermen in an effort to avenge his father, depose the Lannister's and make the North independent lands once again. Despite never having lost a single battle, Robb has begun to lose the war and has found himself with his back against the wall mostly due to the forming of an alliance between the Lannisters and House Tyrell, whose army boosts over 100k, and his mother secretly releasing Jaime Lannister and the Ironmen's seige and holding of the North. While Tywin Lannister considers the war basically over, the King in the North comes up with one final plan which may win the war for the North but he must put his trust in some unlikely allies to pull off the victory. But can they do it? 3.) Dany's quest in the Free Cities. The last book ended with The Mother of Dragons leaving Qarth and getting enough money for a ship or three. She now continues her through other free cities in an attempt to gather support and build an army for her own journey to Westeros. Assisted as by right hand man Jorah Mormont and joined by two new advisers in Strong Belwas and his squire Artisan Whitebeard. Dany gets her first experiences at building alliances and creating the army she plans to use to retake her families throne. But the more Dany travels the free cities the more she realizes that she will have to do things she never thought acceptable like buying an army of slave soldiers. The more horrific things Dany sees, though, the more she has trouble dealing with and begins to take the first steps into become a leader and decides to what she can to help these oppressed people. Can Dany become a good leader or will she start to lose her way just as her father the Mad King once did? 4.) The marriage of Joffrey Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell. The alliance that was pivotal in the Lannister's defeating Stannis Baratheon last book is too be cemented. Much of the book goes into the planning of the royal wedding as well as all the political double dealing going on behind the scenes. At the center of this is Tyrion Lannister, the former Hand of the King who was also essential in defeating Stannis, gravely wounded after the battle and replaced as Hand by his father Lord Tywin. The dwarf still continues to try and maintain the alliance that was made in victory, in spite of the actions of his own house trying to minimize his roll in running the realm, as well as trying to control the amount of blood shed between the various armies in the city, especially after the arrival of House Martell, an old house with an old grudge against the Tyrell's and Tyrion's father Tywin.... Other smaller plot lines include: -Defeated Self-Crowned King and prophesied lord of the light Stannis Baratheon refuses to surrender after his utter defeat in the Battle of the Blackwater. Back at Dragonstone with the remnants of his army, Stannis begins to plan his next moves to take the crown. But with the outlook so bleak and the red priestess Melissandre in his ear, can Stannis maintain his sanity and his integrity? Can Davos (who did survive the Blackwater) keep Stannis from completely succumbing to the red woman's influence? -Bran Stark still continues his trip North, hiding with the Reed's and his mentally handicapped servant Hodor as they attempt to escape to beyond the wall to find the Three Eyed Crow. This was the storyline I probably liked the least in the book. Everything always stays so vague to me on what exactly the Three Eyed Crow could for Bran other than help him control his Warg abilies, Bran's ability to enter control animals while he sleeps. Bran's storyline here doesn't really answer much and feels like a bridge to a bigger story in a future book. -Sansa Stark is still a hostage in King's Landing and with her brother's Bran and Rickon believed dead by everyone, the Lannister's begin executing their plans for the lady who would become Heir to Winterfell should anything happen to her brother Robb. -After escaping Harrenhal, Arya continues her trip to meet up with her family along with her friends Gendry and Hot Pie though they quickly are found by some of her father's own bannermen things are not as they seem. I don't want to say anymore because Arya's story is so good and she has the most POV chapters of any other character to tell it. The book almost belongs to her just as much as it does Jon. -Jaime Lannister, freed by Lady Stark at the end of the last book, is escorted back to the North with the promise that he will bring Sansa and Arya Stark back in return for her releasing him. At first underestimating his guard and escort, Brienne of Tarth, Jaime is soon humbled in more ways than one and begins to think about what his life has meant to this point, being a man without honor. This is easily the best of the first three books and I highly recommend that you read this immediately after finishing the first two books.","2013-09-29","United States","","true","5","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27S1PB74VQZYE"
"B000FBFN1U","5","Martin Owns The Throne","1) This is, BY FAR, the best fantasy I have ever read. Ever. Better than Donaldson, Jordan, Goodkind, Brooks, better than everyone. 2)This is, BY FAR, the best characterization I've ever come across in the fantasy genre. Never in my life have I at so many different times over the course of the three books written been so amazed (Daenerys from the fire, obtaining the Unsullied, choosing between the {better?} of two betrayels) stunned (Catelyn, Ser Barristan Selmy) grief-stricken (from deaths of beloved characters, of course only to realize by the end of the next chapter there are so many fantastic characters left). And of course these are just a few examples, there are so many more but don't want to mention at the risk of spoiling new readers. Yes -- amazed, stunned, saddened. I spontaneously and literally yelled, gasped, cried, and cheered while reading these books. Never have I been so emotionally invested in such a large cast of characters. Memories of these books bring forth emotion in me even now, a month after I read this, his latest book. 3)Fabulously intricate plotting. I find it interesting that a common thread in the slightly more negative reviews of this book find Martin a bit ponderous -- that there's so much writing with not alot of action. This couldn't be further from the truth! Yes, this is high, epic, cruel fantasy of the tallest order. Yes, this is a tall read for younger readers, or those weaned on Jordan, Goodkind, Brooks, etc. But there literally isn't a SINGLE CHAPTER in any of his books where some part of the plot isn't advanced in some way -- spanning over 2000 pages of hardcover text. That's how good the writing is. 4)Deftly understated magic. I remember reading the first book thinking to myself, 'where's the magic? isn't this supposed to be fantasy?' And I kept reading, still finding almost no magic. The only real magic from the first book I can remember bookends the first book. I will never forget the birth of the Unburnt at the very end of the first novel. I'm gasping right now as I recall it. Such a POWERFUL moment. And there was some magic there. And the fact that my senses hadn't been already been dulled by the overdone, contrived use of magic found in so many other fantasy novels allowed me to feel the real impact of what Dany accomplished at the end of that first novel. Magic means so much more in these novels because at least over these the first three books, there is so little to be found. 5)Spectacular dialogue. This is the best dialogue I've ever read. Razorsharp wit, acid tongues, stoic nobility, prideful revenge, hungry vengeance, soul-baring sadness, and so many other wonderful emotions conveyed by superior dialogue. If this review weren't so long, I'd quote a few passages. I just remember reading some of those Lannister exchanges saying to myself 'you go! oh yeah! perfect!"" I remember laughing out loud at some of the things said, not so much because they were humorous (although some of them were) but because so often the pointed words exchanged felt more like the point of a rapier twisting through the ribcage into the recipient's heart. It's just that good. So consistently good. 6)Anyone remember Thomas Covenant? One of the great anti-heroes in fantasy. You rooted for him and hated him. You knew he was the good guy, but you were never quite comfortable enough with who he was to cheer him on without reservation. Well, many characters like him, not just one, populate Martin's books. As soon as you think you've found the bad guy, you begin to root for him as well. And you wonder, as you go from chapter to chapter, how you can find yourself rooting for almost every character in the book? Well, that's just one of the many great things about Martin's books. Practically every character is an anti-heroe and how a book can be so riveting with (at this point) no clear villain is a testimonial for the great characterization in these books. People, I'm not kidding. This is the best out there. If Martin pulls off this series it will far and away be the best epic fantasy ever written. It already is, I'm just praying it's sustained. Yes, it's better than Tolkien, but only in the way that The Godfather was better than the old great silent pictures of the early 20th century. I regard Tolkien's work with great reverance, and it's wonderful to see the foundations of the fantasy genre brought to the big screen, but Martin is taking the genre to new heights. He truly is. For me, I knew at least the first book was special early on. If you can... sense something... if yours eyes open just a bit, if your curiosity is peaked... if you're thinking 'hmmm'.... as the first chapter closes with the discovery of the Direwolves, then you'll be tasting just a hint of the wonderment Martin's books can give you. Just try not to be too sad when you've finished and realize there may not be anything this good for a long, long time to come.","2002-05-04","United States","","true","6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CM79QFF19I4P"
"B000FBFN1U","5","Duh, the book is Top Ten Ever for me; and this edition is the best. Get many copies!","""Paperback"", not ""mass market"" (which I've since given away) or hard cover (these are too big for a comfortable hardcover). Beautiful, glossy cover; nice large size, good typeface and paper — all my GoTs will be in this same format [I hope]. These books are meant to be devoured, folded over and indulged in, and this size/print beats all other editions! As for the book: I don't give spoilers, but I will say it's the most heart-stopping and page-turning of the ASOIAF books ...so far. It's the book in the series that, even if GRRM screws the pooch and ruins the series (like TV's ""Lost"", or Jordan/Sanderson's ""Wheel of Time""), this third book of Ice and Fire will stand the test of time. That's not to take away from the series as a whole, or especially not from the first two book (Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings), but just to say that ...s*** gets real in this book. It's highly re-readable, and every character and story is given good time (unlike, in my opinion, the next few in the series so far). As time has passed since my first read, my meticulously-recorded list of ordered ""favorites"" at GoodReads.com has been invaded by very few modern books. (I like the classics a lot.) This book is one of those few which broke not only my Top 50 ( with #1 and #2 being Don Juan and Purgatorio — not everyone's favorites, I know, but books I've transcribed by hand out of appreciation), but knocked Gatsby off the Top 10. If I recall, Cryptonomicon (Stephenson) is the only other ""modern"" (last 20 years) books in my Top 20. (Not that I don't have a few questionables in my Top 50, but I pride myself in keeping my favorites free of pretentious-sounding literature that I didn't really like but maybe 'appreciate'; and quite honestly having plenty of what others consider ""true crap"" books that I've happened to find enjoyable, like Heinleins, crowding out normal ""classics""). I love reading, and laughing, and having my emotions jerked around — Storm of Swords definitely moved from about instant favorite #40-somthing to Top 20, to knocking of Cat Who Walks through Walls (the ""trashy Heinlein"", as it's been reviewed here and at GoodReads), to slaying Things Fall Apart, and this year, to finally making it to #10 (Gatsby's former spot). Not sure it can knock of Brothers Karamazov; THAT might depend on GRRM's finale (if I live for another 40 years)! But ultimately, who cares: I'm setting this book between the Brothers K and Gatsby, and I really do love those reads; that's how much I like this book. And I sincerely hope that GRRM gives us a #6 that is more similar to the first three books of this series, but I honestly don't think it's plausible. ASOS took the enjoyable-if-pedestrian material of AGOT and ACOK and shot the epic to the moon. I'm not sure GRRM could *do* this again. Excellent book. Belongs on everybody's bookshelf.

"B000FBFN1U","5","There aren't enough superlatives for this series","I'm going to take a break from reading George R.R. Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice series for a while. But it's not because I'm growing weary of the series; it's because I find myself so engrossed in it that the characters and settings are finding their ways into my dreams. A Storm of Swords, the third book in the series, is also the third book I've read in a row. The series is that good and that engrossing. (And I promised myself I wouldn't gush about never having cared for fantasy novels before as I did in my previous two reviews.) A Storm of Swords carries on the intricately plotted story of Westeros (and beyond) with both familiar characters and new ones. If you thought Martin was unafraid to kill off main characters after the noble-to-a-fault Ned Stark met his fate on the executioner's block in the first book, just wait until you get to A Storm of Swords. No fewer than five major characters meet their ends in these pages, including a couple that will break your heart and at least one who's death you'll cheer. The lives of several other characters seem in jeopardy by the end of the book. (Nope, I'm not going to spoil it for you. Just read the book!) I don't know how Martin does it. He weaves together the lives of several dozen characters over the course of this series. Such a task would be daunting, by Martin makes it look easy as his narrative swoops around Westeros and across the Narrow Sea. He intertwines the fates of the various characters in unexpected ways that, even after reading a couple of thousand pages, can still surprise you. This is epic storytelling at its very finest. Please don't confuse me with a literary sycophant. Martin does have a few minor tics that get under my skin a bit in A Storm of Swords. For one, I appreciate his deft turns of phrase, but in some places they come across as a bit strained and too close to the modern idiom. In one place he has Robb Stark say, ""I told you to hold Riverrun. What part of that command did you fail to comprehend?"" It seems a bit ""modern"" in the world of Westeros. Then later on in the book another character uses the expression, ""What part of 'yield' do you not comprehend?"" Yeah, it's a minor thing, but it just felt out of place to me. My other quibble is the fate of Arya. The poor girl has been wandering around Westeros since the end of the first book, and despite a few near misses she still has yet to reconnect with anyone from her scattered family. I think even Martin realized this since at one point he writes, ""Arya was tired of making for Riverrun. She had been making for Riverrun for years, it seemed, without ever getting there."" I heartily concur with that sentiment but I'm also guessing Martin has some major plot points ahead for Arya, so I'll be patient with the game of Where in Westeros is Arya Stark Today for a little longer. For those two quibbles I'd deduct maybe a half of a star. That slight deduction is offset by some of the new revelations A Storm of Swords contains. We're introduced in a big way to the Wildings (along with giants, mammoths and even, apparently, a close-up view of one of the Others). I'm particularly fascinated by The Wall and the Night's Watch, so I gobbled these sections up like a shadowcat chewing up a wilding. Then there are new settings such as the Pyke, Dorne, a glimpse of Littlefinger's ancestral home with its plentiful rocks and sheep ... ummm, ""poop,"" plus several exotic cities across the Narrow Sea. As fascinating as some of the new characters are (yep, I'm looking at you, Brienne), the changes taking place in some of the characters who have been around since the first book are just as fascinating. Jaime and Tyrion both seem to be going through some major self-reflection. Jon Snow is growing into a man at The Wall. Even Sansa, my least-favorite character, is blossoming amid the drama that surrounds her. Like I said at the start of this review, I'll be taking a brief sabbatical from Westeros. But after bringing all that I love about this series to mind as I write this review, I don't think my break will last very long.","2012-04-17","United States","","true","8","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39DHEXO21ZWDK"

"B000FBFN1U","5","There is a difference between bad reviews and BAD REVIEWERS","For many years, I held off starting this series because of the negative reviews and complaints. But after enough friends compared the series to The Wire in terms of scope and complexity, I realized that I had to give it a shot. Now I believe that this series represents one of the masterworks in the fantasy genre. There is nothing I can add to the positive reviews but I would like to address the negative reviews. If you look closely you will realize there are very few bad reviews, ONLY BAD REVIEWERS!!! The vast majority of negative reviews can be broken down into a few groups: BAD REVIEWERS GROUP ONE: Children (emotionally or mentally). I stopped reading fantasy books in my early twenties because they are, by and large, childish and simplistic. Some reviewers complain that they don't like the characters or can not identify with the characters Mr. Martin has created. I can only assume that these people want HEROES and VILLAINS. To those reviewers I say - stick with Disney films. The characters created by Mr. Martin are complex and ambiguous. In fact, many of the characters I hated in the first book, I found myself rooting for by the third book. BAD REVIEWERS GROUP TWO: Impatient amusement park riders. I will be the first to admit that it is hard to wait to find out what happens next. But people who want Mr Martin to ""finish the series"" seem to be operating under the faulty assumption that this series will end in some glorious conclusion that ties everything together. I have no such expectation. This is not Lord of the Rings. Good will not eternally triumph over evil and justice will not be granted for everyone. If that is what you are looking for, then you are craven and should return to your childish fairy-tales! BAD REVIEWERS GROUP THREE: The Choose your own adventurers. By books three and four you will notice more and more reviewers complaining about which characters Mr. Martin focuses on. Rarely, if ever, do they complain about the quality of the prose or the rich detail of this world Martin has created. Usually their reviews can be boiled down to - ""I want to know what happens to so and so right now!"" They also like to complain that some chapters are just filler that do not relate to the story. It seems to me that this complaint is premature until the series is complete. Minor characters in the first book are major characters in the third book and some characters disappear in the first book only to pop up again in the third. With this in mind I will assume that these filler characters or the information revealed in their chapters is relevant to later parts of the story. If you like a chef, you will be excited to eat whatever he dishes up. Not all of the meals will be to your taste but what you enjoy is the chef's creativity and boldness, not a specific flavor. This group of bad reviewers loved the first meal dished out and now they want everything to taste the same - To them I say - stick with Taco Bell! That way you always know what you are getting. BAD REVIEWERS GROUP FOUR: The Kindle reviews. Reviews regarding kindle formatting have no place amidst the book reviews. And some of these people complain that the kindle version should never cost more than the paperback version. I would argue that having all of the books in a slender little device is an added bonus that is worth something in-and-of-itself. Just imagine trying to travel with all five books! If you have the patience and maturity to go on this journey then I urge you to do so. Leave your expectations at the door and let the story unfold as it will. If you are going to read a story that is thousands of pages long, I would hope you are there for the journey, not the destination. For the rest of you, enjoy your Disney/taco bell/fairy-tales. Thank you, Mr. Martin for creating such a rich and surprising world. I am along for the ride, wherever it leads, and for however long it lasts!","2011-06-20","United States","","true","11","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NARMT12UN0S9"
"B000FBFN1U","4","A one star increase from the last book","I was never bothered by the deaths of seemingly key and important figures, but rather, the deaths are becoming less surprising. Especially with the good (or in the order v. chaos theory: order) characters. I may have started this review with the end... I find GRRM's style to become extremely heavy, why describe the character to the glove he wears, I would rather imagine it myself, besides, ten pages down the road I forget that he wore thin wool gloves with worn black gloves over them, I just know he wore them. He leaves little to the imagination. The methodical interchange of names is a bit exhausting as well. Beric to Lord Dandarion to the Lightning Lord back to Beric...why can't he stick to one. Or the Dany...Stormborn, the Unburned, Mother of Dragons, Last of the Targarians...that becomes cumbersome, and there are many others. I think he better develops the good characters a little more, he makes them a bit more rounded and more human/multi-faceted, and the same goes for a few of the ""bad"" characters, Tyrion, Jamie...The Hound. Sansa is still ever the prim and proper Lady, but I think floats around within the story and rarely takes an active role. We shall see what is to become of the story, it seems to be thrown into confusion and chaos by the end. All in all, with this book, I have either become better able to cope with GRRM's style of trying to remain unpredictable - or I just don't care anymore. I may just me more along for the ride, and turned off by Martin's antics and heavy hand. I will read, I am to caught up in the fantasy of it all; whether it be naturalist or not, I don't care, I just want a good story when it comes down to it. Arya: I must say, pairing her with the Hound was a great bit of writing. His personality suits her very well, I'm slightly surprised he didn't help her with her sword play, he did, however, help her become less stupid and more thoughtful about her idealisms...what have you. But, his death and her escape, all slightly predictable. She has rarely stayed in the hands of one ""capture"" for longer than a few hundred pages. Her ""good""/""order"" seems to be degrading into a grayish morality. With each passing death she becomes less concerned with death. This seems to make her rather immune to the stupidity suffered by other ""good/order"" characters. I hate to say she is my favorite character, but she appears to be one of the few that are shifty enough to understand how to deal with the chaos of GRRM's world. Lannisters: I was initially repulsed by their story lines, then intrigued. They drive the story in Westeros. The development of the relationship between Tyrion/Tywin/Cersei and Joff was extremely good. Though, I wasn't surprised to see Tyrion blamed for the death of Joff (a big ""FINALLY"" with his death, I knew it was coming; he was so stupid that all the cunning of Cersei and Tywin couldn't save him. It was only a matter of time). But Martin continues to keep Tyrion alive at all costs, and through many absurd turns of events. Tywin's death, I was slightly surprised by that. But, that it came at the hands of a kinslayer makes it slightly more believable, there was no way he could have otherwise died, except at the hands of a traitor. I'm excited for the continuation Jamie's point of view and the development of Cersei's point of view in the next book. Of Tyrion, I suppose I'll have to wait and see what happens to that cunning little bastard. Red Wedding; Foreshadowed by the Frey's inability to be slighted in the least without retribution, and the death of Renly and Joff, and the dialogue between The Red Priestess, Stannis and Davos: two is not three... Speaking of Davos. What happened to him. I assume he died for sending away Robersts bastard.... The Wall: To me this seems to be one of the stronger story lines in the book. Jon, much like Tyrion seems to have the uncanny ability to stay alive in almost all situations. He should have died numerous times... The king-beyond-the-wall and the Crows seem to contradict the order v. chaos theory. The wildlings are the chaos and seem destined to victory, but at the last minute comes Stannis, I'm not sure who the greater villain is, Stannis or the Lannisters, we shall see. ....blah blah blah, my review won't matter much, people will continue reading whether or not they read this.","2011-06-20","United States","","true","12","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39FB7TBY6C0UL"
"B000FBFN1U","5","Probably the best book of the entire series","Which book in the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire written by George R.R. Martin is the best? Many would argue that the third entry in the series, A Storm of Swords, is the most likely candidate. There is no question that it is the largest of the four books published to date; in fact, in England it was published in two volumes (Steel and Snow and Blood and Gold). At Amazon.com A Storm of Swords has 822 reviews, with an average of 4.50365 (90.07%) with 76.6% of reviews selecting the top 5 star review. The book preceding A Storm of Swords is A Clash of Kings and it has a slightly higher average review of 4.50857 (90.17%) but they are less numerous (700) and has a lower percentage of 5-star reviews (71.6%). The first book in the series, A Game of Thrones, is the most well-known, naturally, since it was published first. It has by far the most number of reviews, 1,840 with an average of 4.38587 with 71% being 5-star reviews. The fourth book, A Feast for Crows, is the least popular book of the series so far and most harshly reviewed (an average score of 3.206557 based on 915 reviews). The fifth, A Dance with Dragons, will be released on July 12, 2011. I would generally agree with the crowd at Amazon.com that A Storm of Swords is the best book of the first four in the A Song of Ice and Fire series that I have read so far. The book's impact is not just based on it's length, though, as in most things, size does matter. There are so many important, stunning and horrifying plot twists which affect the characters we have grown to love and hate that several times I had to re-read sections of the book because I was reading so quickly to find out what was going to happen I realized I had missed an important event that had happened. In this third book in the series the story that began in A Game of Thrones has progressed in surprising directions. It is almost impossible to review this volume without giving away important plot developments which a first-time reader should really experience unspoiled. I can say that the structure of the book follows the form of the previous entries in the series, with point-of-view chapters from various characters following one another seamlessly to reveal the overall storyline. There are POV chapters from Lannisters (Jaime, Tyrion and Cersei), Starks (Catelyn, Sansa, Arya and Bran) and their associates (Daavos Seaworth, Samwell Tarly, Jon Snow). Daenerys Targaeryen also returns and makes progress towards establishing herself as a true Queen of Westeros far away in the East. The main storylines (internecine political conflict in King's Landing, Jon's foray beyond The Wall to learn the truth about the wildlings, Daenerys' quest for an Army and a crown, the impact of the War of Five Kings on Westeros' citizens as experienced by several of our main characters) are told with expert deftness and intriguing suspense. You literally do not know who will survive or perish, even if they have a chapter named after them (hint!). Some say that Martin is trying to dethrone J.R.R. Tolkien as the universally acknowledged king of fantasy, and it may be true. Others say that Martin may actually have higher aims such as joining Shakespeare in the canon of literature. I'll leave it up to future readers to decide, but the decision of whether or not to invest the time and energy to read these books should be an easy one for anyone who delights in the pleasure of fiction itself.

"B000FBFN1U","5","A great read, despite sluggish pacing","All of the comments I made about book 2 apply here as well ... although in this case, even though the book seems more complex and fragmentary than ever, the pacing seems slightly faster, and the amount of gratuitous sex and gory violence is a bit less. Unlike book 2, books 1 & 3 doesn't go quite so far enough overboard on those elements to merit a ""Mature Reader"" warning. I think the pacing seems faster because GRRM got busy resolving a lot of dangling plot lines in rather ... ahem ... forceful fashion. Yes, that's a backhanded reference to my comments in book 2 regarding his tendency towards excessively high mortality among his main characters. This book reads like a Greek Tragedy at times. Anyway, despite the incredibly fragmented storytelling, I still found it to be a gripping and highly entertaining read ... due in large part to the growing sense of depth in some of the main villains**. It's not often I finish 3,000+ pages of books in such a short period of time. [SPOILER ALERT] --------------- I like how the author gave added depth to the characters of Jaime & Tyrion Lannister, by introducing nostalgia, regret, remorse, and a latent need for redemption and having a legacy. Tyrion got repeatedly screwed by his own family, no matter how hard he tried, and would up exacting some long overdue revenge. Ditto to a lesser degree for Jaime, who took a refreshingly introspective turn after his maiming. --------------- [/SPOILER END] Highly recommended ... albeit for patient readers with a longer than average attention span. [EDIT] Ok, here's something else that bother's me about GRRM's writing style that I forgot to mention in my review of Book 2 - he seems to take undue pleasure in describing people going to the bathroom. Yes, it's a perfectly normal reality of daily life, and we all go to the bathroom .. but he describes it with such regularity that it's almost like he's doing it to make a statement - like he's flaunting his commitment to hyper realism. I actually remember the very first time that the sound of a toilet flushing was allowed on American TV ... it was the infamous flush by Archie Bunker on ""All In The Family"". People at the time yelled and screamed and talked like the world was ending. Well, it didn't ... but it definitely paved the way for an ever deepening spiral into unnecessarily graphic (and base) entertainment - which brings us back to GRRM, who, in one scene, has someone get shot in the groin with a crossbow, while they're on the privy ... and he goes out of his way to describe how the person's bowels loosen and empty down the chute into the moat below. I realize we'll never go back to 1950'ish sensibilities of Tolkien (in which the author created a vast body of perfect 10 fantasy work that didn't incluide even a single needlessly graphic reference to voiding one's bowels or raping corpses), nor should we ... but there comes a point when enough is enough. I think GRRM repeatedly crosses that line at times. Eddie Murphy demonstrated some time ago that although the word ""f*@k"" is funny, there comes a point when it's possible to overdo it, and it's just not funny anymore. GRRM does the same thing at times in his writing, with excessive references to bodily functions. I'm still forced to give the book 5 stars however, despite my plethora of pet peeves.","2007-08-19","United States","","true","14","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HIUADCHFVBZY"
"B000FBFN1U","4","Marriages not made in Heaven","""A Storm of Swords"" is the third book of George R.R. Martin's six-volume epic, ""A Song of Ice and Fire."" His characters continue to be unlucky in love, and not all of the four kings who were still alive at the end of volume II, make it through volume III. If I were a king in one of Martin's fantasies and someone suggested it was high time I married, I'd jump on my destrier and gallop like hell for the nearest monastery. It would be safer to enlist in the Night Watch and fight animated corpses beyond the Wall of Ice than it would be to take a bride. Speaking of which, the Night Watch and its enemies beyond the Wall come into much sharper focus in volume III. Barbaric tribes of Wildlings begin to fight their way over the Wall, driven by the supernatural Others and their own living dead. Most of the battle scenes take place at or near the Wall in ""A Storm of Swords,"" although the Queen across the Water, Daenerys Targaryen fights a few of her own while freeing slaves and raising her three dragons. Martin doesn't spare his reader the gory details of medieval warfare or courtly love, which is why I don't think he should be compared to T. H. White (""The Once and Future King""). Martin harkens back to the older, medieval legends of Arthur (e.g. Mallory's ""Morte d'Arthur"") where the knights were a much bloodier, bawdier lot---not the types that Disney would want to immortalize. T. H. White's advice on the battles and tournaments, ""Let's skip the parts where Sir Somebody smote somebody...,"" was definitely not taken to heart by Martin. In his first three volumes, knights routinely whack off each other's collops, codpieces, and assorted body parts. Four of the narrators in ""A Storm of Swords"" are mutilated---a nose, a hand, and four finger joints go missing; the young boy-narrator, Brandon Stark was thrown from a window (in volume I) and paralyzed. There are a couple of regicides, a patricide (or an attempted patricide), and a wife murder in volume III, plus other killings too numerous to mention. The two Stark daughters, Princess Sanya (age 12) and Princess Arya (age 10) continue their narratives in ""A Storm of Swords."" Sanya is bent on escaping from the Lannisters who rule in the name of Joffrey, the boy king. Arya, who has already escaped is bent on avenging the death of her father. Every night before she falls asleep, she recites the names of the people she wants to kill. She is an innocent yet repellent little girl who bullies her friends and kills people in order to survive. Her sister Sanya is much more passive. She still believes that someday a noble prince will show up and ride off into the sunset with her. However, she is now certain that her noble prince is not a Lannister. Martin has created a harsh, yet dazzling world where even children have to kill or be killed.","2001-07-22","United States","","true","15","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29FSOP8ACT2M1"
"B000FBFN1U","5","5 Stars","I struggled with what rating to give this one. I was unsure that it measured up to the way I felt about the other books I've given 5 stars, but it definitely provoked my emotions all around. Surprise, excitement, hope, fear, dread, frustration...I could keep going. And when a book brings out so much in me I have to give that book the honor of my 5 Star rating. And so I have. While reading A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings, I found there to be several slow parts. I'd come upon a particular narrator and think ""Ugh, not XXX's chapter! AGAIN!"" And even when a narrator's chapter would come in A Storm of Swords that I wasn't particularly interested in reading (say...like Sam's), most of the time, something would happen that either surprised me or kept me interested. It usually only took a couple of pages to get me excited about the narration swap. The swapping back and forth has always been something that frustrated me because usually just as one narrator's chapter was getting good, we'd swap to one that was less interesting. Not the same in this book. A Storm of Swords is like the third book within the last three months where I've had the thought, ""Absolutely nothing good is happening to these people."" Every single hope I have for these characters is shattered time and time again, but I don't dislike the book because of it. No. If anything, it makes me like it more. It's when things are unhappy that presses me to continue reading until I'm either finished or I come to a place where I feel satisfied. But that did not come. I also found I was quite unable to predict any of the surprises and twist. Though quite a few I probably should have seen coming. Oh well. If Ned Stark's beheadding in A Game of Thrones surprised anyone, just you wait for what's coming in A Storm of Swords. I've frustrated my husband a good bit throughout my reading of this book. Whenever something big would happen, I'd eek and squeal, but I'd refuse to tell him why so that I don't ruin anything for him. He got to the point where he said, ""Either tell me what happened, or shut up!"" Ha! Bless him! I debated on whether to jump right into A Feast for Crows or not, but I still haven't decided. On the one hand, I have quite a few questions after A Storm of Swords, whereas on the other hand, I cheated and looked at the narrators for A Feast of Crows and I'm not sure that it's going to hold the answers to most of my questions.

"B000FBFN1U","4","Great, but getting predictable...","I have been devouring the books of ASOIAF so far, and this one is by far the best. Although at this point in the series I'm getting a bit frustrated by Martin's style (frankly he's infuriating me!) the fact that this is the first fantasy series since ""The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant"" that I can't put down has got to count for something...thus the four star rating. I'm starting to find George RR Martin a *bit* predictable. (By the way, you just *know* that he put that second ""R"" in the middle of his name to sound like Tolkien!) I realize that many people praise this series for breaking out of the typical fantasy ""good versus evil"" archetype and for Martin's willingness to kill off beloved characters. However, by book three most savvy readers are onto this ploy, and frankly we know what to expect. We realize that none of the characters will ever achieve the goals that they have set out for themselves. In fact, you can usually tell that a character is about to be killed off right around the time that it seems like they're about to finally achieve their goals or get revenge for an injustice. In addition, any sympathetic character that isn't central to the plot is sure to die eventually. For example, although I have absolutely NO inside knowledge that this is true, I'm POSITIVE that Martin will eventually kill off Davos in one of the later books... In addition, the length of this series is starting to give it a very melodramatic tone, other reviewers have compared it to a ""soap opera"", and I think that's a spot on description of what this series is. We're given drops of information VERY slowly regarding some of the main plot twists, and this keeps you coming back for more, but it's not very filling. ""Who tried to kill Bran?"", ""Was Rhaegar Targaryen a bad guy?"" ""Who poisoned Jon Arryn?""...""Who shot J.R.?"" Thankfully, most of the plot questions from ""A Game of Thrones"" are finally tied up in ""A Storm of Swords"". The problem is, Martin hasn't really created anything to replace them, and I have a sneaking suspicion that the rest of the series will suffer as a result. I'm also finding the sadistic treatment of House Stark to be wearing pretty thin at this point. Here's the formula: Lannisters will always win, but their victories will be hollow, and Starks never win period (except once at the Wispering Woods). I threw the book across the room after a certain crimson matrimonial incident...you've got to hand it to Martin though; he knows how to tweak his readers. Bottom line, I'll read this series through to the end, it's endlessly enjoyable, but those who put it in the same class as Tolkien or Donaldson are a bit off base...those writers knew when to quit. In many ways A Storm of Swords is the end of the trilogy, and although I haven't started a ""Feast for Crows"" yet, I have a suspicion that the whole structure of this series is unraveling quickly.","2006-01-18","United States","","true","17","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SVQ5CDHOJSN9"
"B000FBFN1U","5","Sprawling, Rewarding, and Depressing","George R.R. Martin faces a bold new challenge thus far in the series: that of keeping his sprawling story from crushing under its own mass. It takes Martin the first hundred pages of A Storm of Swords just to bring us up to speed on his characters, the lives of all of who have been shattered by the ravages of war. The reader is given no fewer than ten story threads to follow, which can be cumbersome when switching between characters. Depending on who your favorite characters are, readers can become nitpicky about certain chapters. I’m sure that Martin must have become tired over trying to balance all of the characters at a certain point, specifically keeping in mind that some readers prefer certain characters to others. However, with that being said, you should give the author the benefit of the doubt, and just trust his judgment in regards to who should get the most chapters. It all works out in the end. Whereas some other fantasy novels are long, but shallow, Martin goes through painstakingly detailed story arches, characters and world building, to develop his novel into one of the best books in recent memory. The reason that Martin is the biggest name in fantasy right now, is that his characters, and plots are multifaceted. His characters are all powerfully conflicted individuals who actions, although troubling at times, are motivated by things we can all relate to: love, honor, justice, etc. What separates Martin from everyone else in the genre, including Tolkein, is that he likes to focus his characters right in the heart of darkness. If the ending of A Game of Thrones surprised you and got your blood pumping – throwing all of the “good will triumph evil” themes that fantasy fans have gotten used to – A Storm of Swords has scenes that will likely leave some readers in a catatonic shock. In this saga, nothing is what it seems, including some of the most hated “enemies” of the novel. Indeed, you might well wonder how the series will continue to out due its predecessors, and who will be left alive when the dust settles. It is in this manner that Martin strips the fantasy genre of its usual naïve romanticisms of good overcoming evil. Nothing is fair in life, especially when life consists of living in the perilous realm of Westeros. Loyalties mean nothing, and true love only consists within songs and dreams. You might sit back and think that Martin is a pretty damn cynical man, and perhaps you are right. Sometimes reading this book felt like it was just too much to take in. The series without a doubt becomes taxing, specifically with the addition of this book. If you are interested in any of the usual fantasy tropes, this series is definitely not for you, especially this book.

"B000FBFN1U","4","A Stunningly Fantastic Bloodbath","The game of thrones ends, but lurking in the cold shadows of the far north the real fight it awaiting the survivors of “A Storm of Swords”, the third book of George R.R. Martin’s epic series A Song of Ice and Fire. In a series already known for its unexpected twists on fantasy tropes, this book sent fans into the depths of depression as well as the joys of delirium only to realize that there was so much more to go through. After the battle of the Blackwater, the Lannisters are in the ascent as the war turns against Robb after he breaks his marriage agreement with the Freys. Things get worse after his biggest bargaining chip is released by his own mother as Jaime Lannister heads to King’s Landing only things quickly get out of hand on his turn to Cersei’s bed as well as his view of himself. Yet in a series of ever worsening weddings Robb and Joffrey perish sending the North and the Riverlands into the chaos while Tyrion Lannister is put on trial for his life for the death of his nephew. As southern Westeros becomes a wash in blood, the Mance Rayder’s Wildlings attack Castle Black from the south and the north after the failure of the Great Ranging. Like in the first two books, Martin kills his first point-of-view character in the book in the prologue as wrights attack the Fist of First Men that less than half of the Night Watch survives. Through Jon’s POV we see first his journey with the Wildings over the Wall before his escape to warn his brothers and then lead the defense of the Wall before a surprise attack ends the Wilding threat. Meanwhile Samwell survived the Fist and has an encounter with Bran, the Reeds, and Hodor as each tries to get to the other side of the Wall. Meanwhile in Essos, Daenerys travels to Slaver’s Bay and begins liberating the three great slaver cities taking first the Unsullied as her army then conquering both Yunkai and Meereen in turn before settling in the later to learn how to rule. “A Storm of Swords” shows that wars usually end in very messy ways and that the fallout will have lasting repercussions, Martin really drives this home when he has his first Epilogue chapter that shows the sins of crimes committed in war not only live on but can have dire magical consequences in Westeros. As in the first two books the political intrigue, the growing power of magic, and combat are in abundance but the reader is also seeing the real consequences of decisions that are having decided effects on all sorts of conspiracies and strategies. “A Storm of Swords” is the bloody conclusion to the first act of George R.R. Martin’s magnum opus leading to a second act full of feasting crows and dragons dancing.","2016-02-20","United States","","true","19","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWINBRZGHBIKY"
"B000FBFN1U","5","Shockingly Amazing . .","Let me say this. I read the ""Spoilers"" before I read this book and it still shocked the living daylights out of me. This book will go down as the greatest fantasy book ever and will go down as how TV/Movies/Books should be done. Martin puts long leagues between he and Tolkein and other ""fantasy"" writers with this work. There will never be a book in this series as strong as this book, ever, you can't duplicate this greatness you can only just appreciate it. It is his ""Hamlet"" it is his ""The Raven"" it is his ""David Copperfield."" The book starts off with the Night's Watch, because so many thugs have joined it, they are tired of their vows and they are ready for a mutiny. SIX MAIN CHARACTERS die in gruesome ways in this book, something not seen since ""Robotech Anime"" or ""Fist of the North Star."" Many minor characters die as well. There are weddings that are unforgettable. The book takes off after the Battle of the Blackwater, King's Landing is healing, Joffrey has dumped Sansa and is marrying M. Tyrell. Robb Stark has won battles on the field, but he is losing the political end. Arya is on the run looking for any family member that may be alive, and The Hound has fled King's Landing. Three false King's die, while another false King is captured. There are heroes who perish along with Villians, some you will cry about, others you will cheer. Jon Snow is with the wildings as they attack the wall, what will Snow do? He knows Nothing!!! Tywin Lannister assumes power as Hand of the King and puts Cersei's plans to assume power on hold. Tyrion is Tyrion, learning the game. Varys and Little Finger make moves The Ironborn, while being good Viking raiders they are horrible leaders and can not sustain their victorires, The Dorne want revenge against The Mountain for the rape and murder of Elia, leads to a great show down. Tyrion is on trial for more ""Crimes."" Robb makes huge mistakes, mistakes that will haunt the reader forever. Catelyn Tully makes a horrible mistake again, this woman meddles too much and hurts her family more than she helps. Stannis is still enchanted with Melsiandre even after the defeat on the Blackwater and still believes her horse crap. Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth become likable. After this book Westeros is left in chaos . .. and becomes a field of corpses fit for a ""Feast of Crows."" I do think Martin underestimates the power of Honour and Good Guys in life. I think the author's Nhilistic views bleed a bit in this story, but you have to write what you are.

"B000FBFN1U","5","Dog sausages and pigeon pies and redemption of an incestuous knight","Such exotic food and under-aged matrimonies reminded one that this wasn't real but fantasy stories. GRRM's 3rd instalment was thrilling not just for the heroes he created for readers to love, but also the indispensable villainous villains that incensed us with their dishonourable ways. It was exhilarating to see Jamie Lannister, a character we despised earlier, had turned around completely and redeemed himself handsomely with acts of heroism and compassion despite him having endured hellish conditions as Robb's prisoner and the loss of his right hand, his precious hand sword to bandits. A rejuvenated one handed Jamie would go on to save a huge, ugly Brienne of Tarth from a wild vicious grizzly bear, and henceforth gain himself a lifelong friend and my avid admiration. Sure his incestuous behaviour with Queen Sister Cersei would disgust most including me, but then again, are not human sexual desires beyond the powers of anyone's choosing? Not to be outdone were onion lord Davos and our hound Sandor whose unselfish acts of valor were none the less immensely uplifting to the reader. Key villains, like Joffrey and Tywin met with their demise. These villains died horrible deaths while my heart cheered unashamedly. On a sombre note, this 3rd book was heavy with grief to readers because more good people died. These fantasy characters, like us humans, were after all mortal. Therefore it was heartening when Ygritte told Jon that while no one should deny death, we must live first before dying. Our dragon queen on her rampage to champion slaves over their masters, discovered that noble acts like freeing up slaves must be followed up with good governance including the feeding and sheltering of the newly emancipated. Between being a slave who toils 16 hours aday but has 3 square meals a day versus an emancipated who is starving, it's easy to guess which option the slave prefers. The most inspiring character once again was Tyrion, who has endured all his life the cruel prejudice from society including the shunning by his father and sister. Pushed to the limit, Tyrion stood up to his unloving father, Tywin Lannister, his vengeful sister Cersei, and the lying whore Shae. It was heartbreaking to Tyrion that Tywin would convict his very own flesh and blood even though he knew Tyrion was innocent. Once again, our new one-handed hero, Ser Jamie, rescued his little dwarf brother, with the help of Eunuch Lord Varys. It was extremely heart warming to witness the 'freaks' stand together in the face of the cruel normal world.","2014-10-18","United States","","true","21","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15OUXQVK11P2Y"
"B000FBFN1U","5","A Brilliant, But Harrowing Tale","A Storm of Swords is as well-written as the first two books in George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire, but this one left me feeling unsettled after finishing it. The story picks up immediately where A Clash of Kings ended. Robb Stark remains the King of the North, but his decision to marry another woman threatens to undo his alliance with the Freys. Catelyn is so concerned about her daughters that she’s willing to ransom the Kingslayer for their safe return (this development introduces Jamie Lannister as a viewpoint character for the first time). Sansa remains Cersei’s hostage, while Arya has escaped from Harrenhal, hoping to find her way back to Robb. Meanwhile, Jon is with the wildlings beyond the wall, Daenerys and her dragons are still far away in the east, Tyrion lies in bed recovering from the attack on his life, and his ruthless father becomes the Hand of the King. Even more than in the prior two novels, nothing works out the way you’d expect in A Storm of Swords. I counted no less than four major plot twists, and there’s a shocking body count as far a major characters are concerned. Martin is almost fiendish with the turmoil he put his characters through, and every time you think a character is safe or making some progress toward his or her goals, Martin changes the game, often in brutal and unexpected ways. I believe this is what left me so unsettled. One twist near the middle of the story was so jaw dropping that I never felt the same about the book the rest of the way. Of course, this is one of Martin’s gifts: creating characters that the reader truly cares about. And when something awful happens to some of them, I found myself more emotionally drained than I ever expected with this novel. Still, I was unable to put this book down, and the more harrowing events became, the more I kept reading, sleep be damned. The brightest storyline belongs to Daenerys. Martin has handled her character arc from the first novel to this one brilliantly, and she is fast becoming my favorite character in this series. I didn’t think I’d root for a Targaryen to rule Westeros, but I am now – at least until Martin throws yet another unexpected twist into this tale, which might change my perspective entirely. I highly recommend A Storm of Swords, but be prepared to be taken for a rather harrowing ride.","2013-03-06","United States","","true","22","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RF5DAJ6VF13N1"
"B000FBFN1U","5","It will interrupt your life and give you the best story you've ever read!","I will not have any spoilers in this review. Only warning: I am a fanatic fan of A Song of Ice and Fire series, a new convert to the world of fantasy fiction and mad about George RR Martin's language, writing voice, characters, story telling, dialogue, and most of all, genius imagination. This is the 3rd book in the series and I have read the first 2 and loved both. I don't care what people say about books 4 & 5. I can't wait to devour them. I would be happy to stay lost in Westeros forever! And I swear it by the old gods and the new ;), I have decided this is the BEST - single BEST - book I've read in my life and I've read a lot of books. Every character POV makes you see the world in a new lens, it's never black or white. It's never what you think, it's impossible to guess (and I'm good at guessing!!) and every page and every character is a gate into a new world. Most of all, I love LOVE the language, the words that Martin creates, here are some of my favorites: Blood of my blood. Smallclothes. Make water. My sun and stars, my moon and stars. A mummer’s farce. Khaleesi. Like nipples on a breastplate. What in seven hells. My blood riders Halfman, imp, dwarf. The seven take you/him. Winter is coming. Gods be good. You know what's funny? I am new to the world of fantasy fiction and a big fan of The Lord of the Rings stories, but this is where my pulse quickens. With Martin's story telling. With his incredible characters, his stunning prose, and his shocking twists and turns. They are deep too. This is not on-the-surface kind of action that bores me to tears. This is a world within a world and it intrigues you, it challenges you, and it saddens you too. Because it's good. It is really really THAT good. A Song of Ice and Fire has changed my experience and relationship with books and fiction, and here I thought I had a pretty good one to begin with. Read them. They're worth all 8000 or so pages! Off to book 4 for me. Hope you enjoyed my ranting ;)!","2013-11-20","United States","","true","23","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQO08YR7FUOYF"
"B000FBFN1U","5","Gripping from start to finish","A Storm of Swords quickly became my favorite in the Song of Ice and Fire series to date, leaving me breathless and with teeth often clenched tighter than King Stannis. There were so many shock and awe moments throughout this book it kept me up well past 2:30 in the morning most nights because I couldn't put it down for fear of leaving someone in a lurch. ""If I go to bed, Tyrion might not be alive when I wake up in the morning,"" I squeaked. ""If I turn off the light, Jon Snow might have his head lobbed off by Mance Rayder while I'm sleeping."" While I won't give anything away for those who've yet to read this far into the series, I will say this: Martin is definitely not afraid to kill his characters, so brace yourself. Other reviews I've read claimed Martin's willingness to make his creations suffer is a bad thing, and some have even said they stopped reading when the blood started to wash the walls of every castle in Westeros, but in a game as deadly as this, how can we expect everyone to survive? Since book one Tyrion Lannister intrigued me, and my love for him as a character has only continued to grow. One of the most delightful surprises in A Storm of Swords, however, was how quickly Martin warmed me to characters I'd previously loathed with a passion. I found myself actually feeling a hint of fondness for both Jaime and The Hound, and even a little sympathetic toward Stannis Baratheon. I only have a few minor complaints about A Storm of Swords. For one, I would have liked to follow Bran's path a little more closely toward the end, and the lack of attention paid to his journey made him feel as if he disappeared entirely. Perhaps, considering Bran's actual situation, that was Martin's intention. I'm not sure. I was also thrown off by the number of typos I came across in the Kindle version. I'm not sure if these were Kindle exclusive typos, but one example that really stands out around 41%: ""Yet Ser Axell proposes we swoop down on the homes they left behind, to rape their windows and put their children to the sword."" Oops! Watch out, windows of the fallen men. Stannis' men are coming for you."" Despite the number of typos, and occasionally feeling like Bran was all but invisible, I still give the book five out of five stars.","2011-04-29","United States","","true","24","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R349FMQKKYY05J"
"B000FBFN1U","4","Not as good as Game of Thrones but much better than Clash of Kings","Like many others, I discovered this series from the HBO series Game of Thrones. The first book, Game of Thrones, was amazing. I tore through it in about a week as I couldn't put it down. Martin was a bit wordy, but the plot still moved forward. Clash of Kings was all over the place. It took me months to read it. Some chapters were 5 star and some were 1 star. Storm of Swords was better because the plot did move forward in the majority of the chapters. The negatives are that adding new characters makes the individual POV chapters a lot more choppy to read. Although most of the chapters in SOS were more interesting to read than COK, it was more jarring to get into the storyline only for it to end aburptly and go to another one. Even though I expected this because the first 2 books were written this way, it does really disrupt the flow of the story. And it's getting more annoying because I am not vested in a lot of these newer and uninteresting characters. The other biggest negative is the lack of editing. I hear some comment about Martin's wonderfully constructed prose. This series went from a lot of words that tell a great story to too many words with a story in there somewhere. In all honesty, there is no need for these books to be about 1000 words. The same story could be told even better around 400-500 words. There are endless pages of descriptions that could have been summed up in a sentence or two. A writer needs to know that when a reader finds herself skimming, the writer has written too much. Despite the choppy and long read, I still very much enjoyed this book. Dany and Tyrion are my favorite characters so far. The story had a lot of twists and turns. Some unexpected and some very predictable. After reading all the reviews and comments about FOC and DWD, I've decided to read them both at the same time. They are supposed to be happening at the same time after all, so maybe it won't seem so bad. I'm just glad that I didn't have to wait 11 years to find out what happened to Dany and Tyrion. Then again, who knows how long it will take for the Winds of Winter to come out?","2011-10-27","United States","","true","25","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUMM03MQK37YU"
"B000FBFN1U","5","Wickedly-Entertaining, Breathtakingly-Captivating","George R. R. Martin has outdone himself in this, the third tome in his wickedly-entertaining ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" fantasy series. Yes, the series started off at a ploddingly slow pace with ""A Game of Thrones"", but the second book, ""A Clash of Kings"" picked up the pace and the plot got better. This third book improves on the previous two, on just about every aspect. The pacing is faster, the plot is ""tighter"", and the story is finally moving forward. The land of Westeros is still in chaos and turmoil. The smallfolk continue to suffer as the Great Lords play their ""game of thrones"". Meanwhile, against this epic backdrop of war and political maneuverings, characters both great and small gradually reveal their own desires and motivations. Through many twists and turns, the plot will delight you, surprise you, shock you, and might even anger you. Old values, beliefs, alliances, and friendships will be shattered. New alliances are built. The old Gods now give way to the powerful flame god from overseas. Jon Snow returns to Castle Black, with a wildling woman he has taken under the sheets. Meanwhile, his trusty side-kick, the self-described craven, Samwell Tarly has taken it upon himself to rescue a wildling woman from a band of rebel crows. Robb Stark betrayed Lord Walder Frey and now attempts to mend the broken alliance after realizing that he cannot win without the help of House Frey. The Kingslayer, under the escort of Brienne the Beauty, slowly reveals himself through a series of conversations with the maiden from Tarth. Tyrion, ever-clever, slowly tries to regain his political power within King's Landing, and gains himself a new paramour in the process. Daenerys Stormborn, the last of the Targaryens, continue to gather followers, admirers, soldiers, and enemies. As her power grows, so do the list of those who would stop her. Meanwhile, Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion continue to grow stronger. Stannis, the King in the Narrow Sea, has been broken, with no one to turn to but the priestess and sorceress, Melisandre. Many, both high and low, will fall. And the dead will rise again. Winter is coming. The long night is coming. Old heroes will die and new ones will rise to take their place to face the new evil that is about to unleash itself unto the world.

"B000FBFN1U","5","Gritty, bloody, spooky and nice and looong","Some read for writing style, skill or because one favors a particular author; some for the pleasure of reading good books, and others for the love of the genre. My reading preference is for a long, leisurely stroll through alternative worlds crafted by true fantasy meisters, and, 'frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn' how long it may take or how many novels are required in a series to reach the destination that the author has intended. Just gimme words to tantalize the imagination and I am hooked. George R.R. Martin continues to offer a cornucopia of verbal victuals upon which to feast and fantasize. This continuation of his rip roaring saga of blood and battles, betrayal and beastial behavior within the rancorous seven kingdoms is guaranteed to satisfy. The Lannisters are as malicious, cruel, devious and destructive as always, although, wait! there seems to be a hint of redemption for one or more of the lions. Martin is unafraid to knock off readers expectations as well as heros and kings alike ('ole wormy lips) and to make new ones out of bastards and bogeymen. While the politics of personal destruction are cruelly executed, poor Imp, the snotty dialog stabbing forth from Tyrion's caustic lips is especially biting and bitter yet dead on funny at times. This novel is a rich pastiche of nasty and nice, weak and powerful, and in the words of Lord Petyr, ""there are two sorts of people, the players and the pieces"". Who will emerge the hero? The pieces are not yet all in play. One of the more engaging players in this saga is the dragon queen Daenerys Targaryen who must overcome betrayal within her own court and those outside who seek to destroy her before she can claim her rightful throne in the seven kingdoms. One wonders if she will succeed after all the other ""kings"" have self destructed while she awaits in a distant land for events to unfold. Ser Jorah Mormont, her exiled knight will be a crucial player in whether or not she will prevail. I do wish, however, that the author didn't jump around so much from plot to plot with each new chapter. It can confuse and frustrate when one must repeatedly page back to an earlier chapter in order to reanimate the storyline and direction. Secondly, when will the covert power of magic truly animate the story apart from the spooky ""Others"" that are haunting and murdering the wildlings and men of the wall? Martin sprinkles hints aplenty including those mystical dreams of Jojen Reed, a companion of Bran, and the visions seen by the fire worshipping religious zealot Melisandre guiding the petty king Stannis Baratheon, to those of Daenerys adolescent dragons growing into their own magical powers. If you enjoy a nice long, absorbing read, and are a conoisseur of extraordinary writing then this excellent book is a veritable banquet for those who love words, lots and lots of wonderful words.","2000-12-27","United States","","true","27","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4ZSH538M6AK8"

Martin does fantasy like no one else. The third volume in Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series, this book is utterly captivating, suspenseful and heart-wrenching. Never before has a book made me (literally) laugh, cry and gasp as much as this book has. Full of suspense and shock this book is a real heart-stopper. I recommend that when the book is published again as newer edition it come with WARNING label-WARNING: Might cause angina and at the worst heart failure. First off, these characters are so complex and intriguing that its almost impossible not to love them, even the evil ones. Secondly, the way that the book is written, such careful attention to detail, sensual descriptions and the scope of the book, it's phenomenal. One thing that never ceases to amaze me when reading the ASOIAF books, is the mystery that surrounds all these characters and almost everything the do. One character plots to kill another and you never even know it until they're dead and you're utterly shocked. Countless plans and plots one after the other, it really keeps you guessing, which is one of the many positives about this book. Something else that really beguiles me is how deep we get to see inside of these characters minds. Their pain, grief, suffering, joy pleasure; it really is incredible. Lastly, this book really pulls (no, jerks) on your heart strings. When a character dies it leaves you completely devastated and down-right shocked. Yet this is one of the many things that really keeps you reading. Just when you think someone is about to win the war, BAM, they're dead and you're left wondering how on earth you missed all the little details leading up to it. This book has MANY major character weddings, alliances....and deaths. Again, I cannot express how incredible and fascinating and enjoyable that this book is. Suspenseful, heart-wrenching, mysterious, gripping, shocking and completely amazing, ""A Storm of Swords"" is one of the best books you'll ever read, I promise you.","2015-09-30","United States","","true","28","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1O6KYN12ENYC9"

"B000FBFN1U","5","A Perfect Storm","Love the books, and I love what HBO has done with the TV adaptation. Storm of Swords is the best in the Song of Ice and Fire series so far. I can't wait to see how HBO will bring this excellent ""chapter"" in the series to the screen. I'm glad that I started reading the books to get the source's perspective, because while Game of Thrones Season 1 kept the storyline about 98% intact with very few liberties, the second season had some more noticeable differences. But the differences so far have not been so terrible that I'd complain even a little bit. I'm delighted to finally be ahead of the TV show now. It's cool to read the book then be able to see the characters literally come to life on the screen. The one descrepany from book to screen that is hard to get used to but done very well by the TV people is the age of many of the prime characters. I guess that in a book it's okay to write about tennagers commiting acts of violence, having sex or worse getting raped, but apparantly HBO thought a lot of that would land them in hot water on the screen. And they would probably be correct. The books are very long reads with a ton of words, side stories and descriptions that could have been left out without affecting the story at all. In fact as I look at some of the reviews for some of the subsequent books to Storm of Swords it's a more common complaint by fans. But I was glued to every bit of this third in the series and I know that I'll be compelled to read on. The first three books in the series seem to only set the stage for the rest of the epic series. Although who knows based on the surprising demise of some characters that you'd have thought would never die. What's clear is that more war lies in the future. I'm hooked on A Song of Ice and Fire, and you will be too if you get through the first three.

"B000FBFN1U","5","They just keep getting better","I've already made the extremely bold statement about Game of Thrones that this series is second only to Tolkien. Several aspects make this series outstanding: The characters, the unpredictability, and the harsh realism. The characters are what make this series so good. Martin writes each book from several characters' points of view. The suspense is so well done that you find yourself jumping ahead to that character's next chapter just to see what happens. The characters are extremely well developed, and by writing from their point of view, Martin helps you understand the way they think and act. Every character is fascinating, but there is a handful that I just can't get enough of (Arya, Tyrion). Every character is complex--there are very, very few characters that you can categorize as ""good"" or ""evil."" Instead, characters are a realistic mix of selfish flaws and good intentions. The realism of ASOIAF doesn't end with the characters. In most fantasy books, the author will never kill off a main character. This results in no suspense, as you never fear for a character. This leads to such predictability that it can really detract from a reading experience. This norm is never farther from the truth than in ASOIAF. In Martin's books, no one is safe. Just read Game of Thrones and be prepared to be shocked. Once Martin shows you he's not afraid to kill anyone, it adds so much suspense to the rest of the series. Everything about these books have an air of harsh reality. Folks, these books ain't no Harry Potter, and their not for kids. They describe a dark but enthralling world where violence, incest and rape are commonplace. But anyone who knows anything about the Middle Ages knows these times were not Disneyland. This adds to the realism and suspense. In the back of my mind I have a fear this series could turn into another Robert Jordan debacle, spanning to 10+ books in the series. But then I think, I don't care if this series takes 20 books to finish--every book is so absolutely enjoyable that I hope it doesn't end. A Storm of Swords is set after the major battle of Clash of Kings. Although there might not be as much combat action as Book II, there are even more major plot developments. One you start the last 1/3 of this book, you just can't stop until it's finished. It will leave you happy, sad and mad, and of course, very impatient for Book IV.","2006-09-12","United States","","true","32","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3J0OJNHHX5I5G"
"B000FBFN1U","5","A Satisfying Read/Page Turner","Game of Thrones has intrigued me to the point where I read until my eyes are blurry. Each of the two previous books was great, but book three takes us into more depth in charaacter history and development, as well as challenges, hazards and a few joys, answering some questions and posing new possibilities. Bran's abilities are developing. Poor Sensa is much stronger than she knows. Tyrion is one of my favorite characters and plays a significant role, once again, in this book. Arya, our precious one, is turning into an adorable blood-thirsty youngling, and it will be interesting to see how she handles adolescence. Jon has been sent from The Wall on a mission which will deepen his development. Dany is gearing up for a plunge into fulfilling her destiny, with her dragons at her side, and may the old gods and the new help anyone who gets in her way or offends her sense of justice. Cat inadvertently mucks up Rob's war strategy, in an attempt to free her captive daughters. The King Slayer, Cercei and her horrid ""darling"" son, Joff, continue to toss tainted meat into the stew that is the Game of Thrones. The author blends good and bad, justice and injustice, and strength and weakness, in each character. Of course, I'm totally in love with the Stark wolves and appreciative of their loyalty, love, and protection for each of the Starks. The world behind The Wall is developing in this book. Dont want to say too much more at the risk of becoming a Spoiler. Book 3 has presented us with lust/love, blood, guts, sacrfice, magic, honor, courage, victories/defeats (small/great), and glory galore. The authors weaves a rich tapestry that illustrates the Game of Thrones. . The writing is superb, history rich and vivid. Characters fully drawn and evolving with each chapter. This is a fantasy masterpiece and a real page turner. (Kindle readers will be using the dictionary to look up many of the Middle English, Medieval names for things used in the every day life of our beloved characters.)","2012-12-06","United States","","true","33","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1G69N81BBR13D"
"B000FBFN1U","4","Becoming a very strong series","I was tough on Martin's 1st book, giving it only 3 stars. Well, his 3rd effort had me reading 100 pages a day. I couldn't put it down. Martin has such a knack for making characters you can care about. I find myself liking the Lannisters as much as I like the Starks, and there are not any characters whose fate I'm bored by. (Unlike Robert Jordan, where I find I skip a lot of Nynaeve chapters :)). Martin is also deft in his handling of a rather intricate plot. His world is not as politically diverse as Jordan's, but I think the story benefits from this. His pacing and timing are fabulous, and there was never a time I felt the plot dragging. Martin is driving us toward a thundering climax, and he keeps us on our toes with his numerous clever twists. Epic fantasy has suffered so much from the formulaic plots and paper-doll characters of many of the authors that it's been hard to stay with the genre. Only a few authors have broken the mold; Jordan with his Wheel of Time, Tad Williams with Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, and Martin is well on his way with his Song of Ice and Fire. There is only one thing that kept me from giving five stars for this book. Martin's characters often use vulgar language and there are some moments of descriptive sexuality that I think are unnecessary. Thus 4 stars instead of five. The last caveat: I'm sick of waiting for the next book to come out! I've been waiting for Jordan's books since the 9th grade when I started reading them. I'm 25 now. Will I still be around to finish the series? All that said, A Storm of Swords was a great read and highly recommended.","2002-06-09","United States","","true","34","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YY883ES1IIC"
"B000FBFN1U","4","Want to give it a five, but can't","First of all, let me say that I read this book with insane abandon for a week and a half. I am very happy with this series, and this author, for the same reasons as the other 300 or so people who have written reviews, so I won't bore you with the details. So why the 3 star review, and not five? 1. The plot is exceedingly depressing. Everyone says that Martin writes realistically (or at least as close as possible in a fantasy series), but I really don't think so. The fact is, good guys don't ALWAYS finish last. If you trust your friends and try to do the right thing, you don't always get hanged for it. I know there are some bitter people who like to walk through life thinking that way, but the plain fact is it's not true. In this series, everyone with any shred of honor and compassion is brutally--and I mean BRUTALLY--dealt with. By the end of the book, I had only one character I could still root for. I seriously doubt he'll survive the next book. 2. Not too sure what the main plot is yet. I mean, is it the fight with the Others in the North, or the struggle for the Iron Throne? On one hand, I think it's amazing that he shows us how human concerns often get in the way when we SHOULD be dealing with something more important. After all, the Monica Lewisky trial got more coverage on U.S. television than the Taliban's brutal takeover of Afghanistan. On the other hand, IT'S A BOOK. I need some sort of plot. That's my spiel. Outstanding series so far, but I swear to god if another good guy gets hacked to pieces or paralyzed I'm quitting.","2001-05-14","United States","","true","35","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MGBPJYGE515E"
"B000FBFN1U","3","Hardcover IS NOT the same as other Hardcover reviews","So for whatever reason, a storm of swords has been very difficult to find the past several months. I wanted the illustrated edition, but it is impossible to find anywhere so I settled for the normal hardcover. I was extremely happy with the other reviews, showing the hardcover edition, They stated it had a nice built-in bookmark and design on the hardcover was very beautiful. The hardcover I received is not at all the same as the other reviews. Which actually kind of makes sense as again it’s been extremely difficult to find any copy of a storm of swords the past few months. The addition I received is a hardcover, however it is a blank hardcover and has one of the cheap that slide over the hardcover. The sleeve is exactly the same as the normal version of the book. Which I was very disappointed with. The book itself is a phenomenal book and it is good quality, it is just not what I was expecting from the other reviews of the same hardcover. I would assume that they went this route and will continue to have the hardcover additions be like this because it has been high demand. Maybe a few months from now, they will switch back to the other design. As of October 2024, you will not receive the hardcover edition that is shown in pictures of other peoples reviews. It will be a completely blank hardcover with the cheap green sleeve. I will upload a picture when I have a chance so you guys can see just how different it is. That is my only gripe. Everything else is phenomenal. It would be a five star review if it was the same hardcover as the other reviews.","2024-10-16","United States","","true","36","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8F5Z0QN544QC"
"B000FBFN1U","5","Engrossing!","Martin pens a novel full of adventure, betrayal, and greed with “Storm of Swords,” book 3 in the “Song of Ice and Fire,” series. The novel is over 900 pages – not for the faint at heart – and a bit daunting. It’s taken me months to finish, and while it’s been long for me, it’s been an adventure. Martin uses several point of view characters to tell the “Storm of Swords.” There’s Tyrion, smart and clever, yet a dwarf who is the butt of his nephew’s cruel jabs. There’s Robb, the King of the North, who must win the Frey’s favor or lose all he has gained. Jon, on the Wall, must find out information on the Wildlings and the Others, using all of his cunning to survive. Jamie must not only use his sword, but his wits to make it back to King’s Landing. Arya escapes the city only to find herself a captive and pawn to various outlaws who would use her as a hostage for their benefit. Stannis must prove himself a king, so he travels to the Wall, hoping to save it. Then there’s Daenrys, who learns how to use her swords to conquer, but she must learn to rule before returning to Westros. Every story involves violence, sword play, and cunning. As the realm loses its tenuous grip on the various kingdoms, secrets are revealed, proving a precursor to the upcoming battle between ice (the others) and fire (the dragons). The characters are honest, real, and interesting. There’s good and bad and even some in between – like the “Hound,” Sandor Clegane. Everyone has a distinct motivation to do what they do, even if unknown to the reader. I’m always wondering what is driving a character. A “Storm of Swords” grows the story, looks deeper into the players, and takes the reader on an adventure of a lifetime!","2016-02-10","United States","","true","37","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6SPZSDRK7NV6"
"B000FBFN1U","5","Best in the Series (thus far)","As many times as I've read Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings, I've only read A Storm of Swords twice. After returning to it for the first time in about eight years, I'm startled by how the events of the book are remarkably fresh in my mind. A Storm of Swords serves as the end of the first act of A Song of Ice and Fire, as the War of the Five Kings comes to a climax. So much of importance happens in the book, it's hard to keep track of it all. Characters are shuffled off the board in startling ways, and huge surprises are in store for two of our lead POV's. As much as book one belonged to Ned and book two belonged to Tyrion, book three is arguably shared by Dany and Jon. Delivering a great number of twists and payoffs on elements spun out of the first two books, A Storm of Swords is arguably the most satisfying volume in the series. The ending chapters are breathless page turners, as principle characters are brought again and again to the edge of peril. As angry as many fans of the HBO show were regarding Ned's scenes on the steps of the Sept of Baelor in A Game of Thrones, there are moments in this book even more shocking and horrendous -- I can't wait to see how the television audience reacts to them. In the end, the only disappointment I have in A Storm of Swords is that it was originally setting up a five year gap between major story movements in the series. I know what a stumble it was when Martin entered a decade-long culdesac struggling to finish A Feast for Crows and A Dance With Dragons and fill in that gap within the story. Filling that gap may be important, but I fear it will be many years yet before the story promise offered by A Storm of Swords is fulfilled. New readers should understand that Swords is the climax of an act and that the great twists and turns of the book may not return to the series until the pieces are properly arranged on the board once more.","2011-06-22","United States","","true","38","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZLIZDCBY6DV3"

"B000FBFN1U","4","Excellent, but a little choppy","I've reached page 600 after about a week, and thought I'd share my thoughts so far. First, I agree with many of the posts praising this book. However, I do have a couple of complaints about it. First, it feels ""choppier"" than the others, in that just as a chapter gets going from one character's viewpoint, you are switched over to a different character. It almost feels like a tv script, with mini-climaxes every 10 pages so you can have a commercial break and switch to a different scene. For whatever reason, the first two books seemed to have a better overall flow. Because of that, unlike the previous two books which I could sit and read for hours on end, I find myself reading this book in smaller one and two-hour chunks. My second problem with this book is that so far it hasn't generated the emotional interest in me that the first two did. (Book 1 SPOILER ahead) Remember Bran being thrown out the window by Jaime? Remember Ned's men being slaughtered in the castle at King's Landing and him subsequently losing his head? So far nothing sticks out like that in this 3rd book, although I have about 300 pages to go. I won't rehash the plot, since others have done that. I will say that of the myriad characters and storylines, four stand out as the most interesting in this novel: Daenerys, Jaime, Tyrion, and Jon Snow. For others such as Robb, Bran, Catelyn, Arya, and Sansa, we don't get any insight into the characters - we mostly see them either swept along by events or we see an external view of them acting without hearing about internal motivation or conflict. All of that said, it is still an excellent book and a worthy followup to the first two. Martin deserves nothing but praise for his excellent writing and high standards, unlike other recent high-profile sequel flops like Jordan's ""Path of Daggers"" or Clancy's ""The Bear and the Dragon"".","2000-11-07","United States","","true","40","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RH38S2YLPG5LE"
"B000FBFN1U","5","A Storm of Swords, Book 3 of 'Game of Thrones'","I have to say this book kept me guessing as to what would happen next. There is so much action for each character. I was shocked at two events in this book (ha! no spoilers here). It's creepy about the Others and the wights coming in such numbers and no information yet as to what/how/who is controlling them or originating them. The only storyline that I don't care much for is Danerys. While I like her, I was grossed out about the details regarding her army of 'Unsullied' soldiers. And some of the city conquering that she is in charge of was abit too easy. She is supposed to be only a young 16 or 17 year old, yet she has the wisdom of a 50 year old woman. Dany was heavily sheltered her entire life, so it makes me wonder where she is pulling all her foresight from. I loved the book regardless. I find it very difficult to turn my Kindle off at night as I want to read until I have finished the book. I read all the Harry Potter books. I personally feel each book is written by different authors, trying to sound like the original author, but failing to capture her quirkiness of the first book. Book 2 was very boring and slow. Each Game of Thrones book flows smoothly from one to the next, all from one mind and one author. Not each character gets equal time, but I've liked different perspectives from the good and evil guys. Some of the evil guys are really, really dispicable. This series does more than satisfy my thirst for a fantasy series since the demise of the Stargate franchise and Star Trek series on tv. I hope we see at least 5-10 years of Game of Thrones. I just bought the Illustrated Book and hope this enhances my enjoyment of the reading and tv watching experience.","2013-03-09","United States","","true","41","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QP3Y7N6Z9DSB"
"B000FBFN1U","5","Yep, good","Another winner. I anticipated nothing less. The first half of this book started a little slow, but the second half was like a drug and I just could not put it down. Thankfully I was camping in the mountains so I had all day to read, and I literally did read ALL day, for all 3 days I was there. Many, many, many deaths in this one (even for the series). It could have almost been called a Dance of Death as apposed to a Storm of Swords. Some were pretty bad, but thankfully, some of those deaths were finally people who really needed a knife shoved in their throat. For all the good who perished, at least the bad got it just as well. Seemed a lot like real war to me. No matter who wins the war, the accumulation of deaths makes everyone a loser. This series is at the point now where I'm just not sure it can continue to improve. You all know what I'm talking about. The need to improve and beat the prior the work tends to lead to a level of complexity and increasing liberty with the need to suspend reality in later work. I am hopeful that GRRM won't fall into this category, and the next novel will lend its greatness not an attempt to eclipse the others, but instead lead off in a new direction of awesome. We shall see, but just to make sure I'm well rested, I'm going to read a different work first.

"B000FBFN1U","4","On Reflection...","I read this when it first came out years ago, and I remember walking into the library and our local librarian asking if I wanted to reserve the next one. ""No."" I answered at the time as I unceremoniously dumped it in the returns bin, ""And I'll never read this book again."" Flash forward to watching the series with my partner and we're both asking each other what we remembered from the books and trying to compare. Time, I thought, to break my promise and reread. I'm glad I did, because, you see, I discovered that though my memory told me I finished this book, I didn't. Rereading it, I got to the scene where I'd stopped reading, and BAM! it all came back to me. I remembered lying on that dog-ugly brown couch, reading that last line in the chapter about that one thing that we shan't spoil about (because some people still haven't seen the series or read the books) and Arya is running and The Hound ... well... spoilers, but I remember closing the book. No, I didn't close it. I SLAMMED it shut, which isn't a respectful way to treat library books and you shouldn't do it at all. This time, sitting in the backyard with my e-reader in hand, there was nothing to slam. Clicking the on-off button furiously is just not satisfying in the same way. But I knew, because we'd been watching the series, that what I thought happened at the end of that chapter couldn't really happen. So, I started reading the next chapter. Turns out that back then, I'd actually only finished about 65 percent of the book! Seriously, less than three-quarters of the way through, I'd given up and had spent a decade with a lingering depressed annoyance at Martin. So advice to those planning to read, don't give up. Keep reading. And keep the tissues at hand.","2014-09-19","United States","","true","43","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBU8JYFS8SINP"
"B000FBFN1U","5","A deliciously rich stew","I think its important to keep in mind that Mr. Martin has said that his inspiration for the world of ""Song of Ice and Fire"" was the War of the Roses. This is the conflict between the royal houses of York and Lancaster (Stark and Lannister, anyone?) that inspired Shakespeare to create some of his most memorable heroes, villains and clowns. Similarly, Martin seems to be gaining inspiration as he goes.The sweep of event and the swirling colors of character combine to create a tapestry of believable history that comes along too rarely in fiction. Just as in the real world, the choices made by individuals have ramifications that grow and metamorphize into forces that affect whole nations and lead to both fortune and ruination among the various houses contending for the Iron Throne. It's fascinating to become immersed in a world where individuals actually have the ability to make a difference (the election in Florida, anyone?) The fantasy elements in this tale never strain credibility; they are as weird and frightening to the principals as to the reader. And Mr. Martin never goes over the top - perhaps, if we all wish hard enough, dragons could be brought back, even as the charming but not harmless infants they are here. Ultimately, I believe this is a work about civilization and the world that humans create for themselves. What gods do we discover and how do they help us survive? Who are our leaders and why do they want to lead or how do they manage to survive? How do we cope with the seemingly aimless whims of fortune and luck? The best advice I can give is to re-read the first two books (as several have already recommended) or read them for the first time. But importantly, jump right in and come to know and care for the creatures that make up House Stark and House Lannister. They are fascinating people, not really characters, and they are surrounded by a living world inhabited by folks no less real than they are. And importantly, each of them has the ability and the cussedness to affect that world in ways that can be exhilarating or horrifying. This is a rich stew, indeed. Shakespeare made a career out of the same source material, why not someone as skilled and sensitive as Mr. Martin? And the gnawing need for the next installment is only what we here in the states felt when Mr. Dickens was serializing his stuff so many years ago. This is grand reading of a kind that we haven't seen in many years.","2000-11-19","United States","","true","44","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWZ1XBCELRT4"

One moment I was mad because all the good guys were being killed off and the bad guys were gaining everything with their deception but then when the tables started to turn slowly I began to gain some hope for a sweet revenge. But even though the bad stuff built up, the author did a brilliant job filling in the back ground behind the scenes within each sector. Things start turning around and King Joffrey gets what he deserves. It is funny how within the castles they turn on each other, you don't know really who is loyal and who is only a piece in a game for their own gain in the long run. The author is definitely a master at creating deception amongst his characters for one moment they are friends and lovers but at the tip of the hat, the enemy becomes friend or the friend becomes the one killing you. The story is just mind boggling leaving me hanging in the end with every thing up in the air and waiting for the next move in the game. It left me anxious to start the third book - i look forward to finding out how Jon and King Stannis prepare and fight the others behind the wall, what will Sansa and Little Finger do now that Queen Lysa is disposed of, what and where will Tyron the Dwarf do, Jamie and Ceresi reaction when they find their father the Kings Hand Dead, the Freys, the dragon Queen and her dragons, Kyras adventure across seas, the magic and power of The Lord of light, ?.....

The reason I'm givin it 4.5 stars, is b/c some of the descriptiveness was unnecessary & I didn't really care for Sam's storyline. I only see his storyline being there for a bigger purpose.

If u didn't understand what I meant, let me say it more clearly. THE WORLD HE CREATED HAD IT'S OWN HISTORY. And not some eluded to or vague history, a fully fleshed out history. I'm not gonna go on & on about this book, I could but I won't, sometimes less is more. This is the 3rd in thee series, so if u're about to read this book, u don't need me to tell u how good it is, u already know. My absolute favorite characters r Arya & Tyrion, can't get enuff of'em.

Yeah, that's a woefully inadequate summary but it's not laden with spoilers, either. Here we are, the third installment of Weddings, Beddings, and Beheadings, and my favorite one so far. In fact, I was thinking about downgrading them to 4's just so I could show how great I thought this one was. Martin outdid himself this time. First of all, there were quite a few deaths in this one. I wasn't expecting Robb Stark to go out like that. Tywin and Joffrey more than had it coming, however. The Red Wedding was pretty surprising, as was the trial by combat for Tyrion's fate. Speaking of Tyrion, his wedding to Sansa was also quite unexpected. I'm still not sure where things are going with Davos Seaworth but I'm already itching to find out. Jon Snow continued to be my favorite character, from his stint with the wildlings to his defense of the Wall to his imprisonment and eventual election to commander of the Night's Watch. The prospect of Snow becoming Lord of Winterfell is an intriguing one and I'm anxious to see how it unfolds. Another plotline I'm particularly enjoying is that of Arya and the Hound. The Hound could easily be a scene-chewing villain but is a surprisingly deep character. Arya is shockingly bad ass for a preteen. One character I'm surprised I've grown to like is Jaime Lannister. He's an arrogant unapologetic bastard and I love him for it. I'd read a whole book of Jaime's exploits. Also, how about Petyr Baelish? What a bastard!

"B000FBFN1U","5","The Best Of The First Three Books","A Storm Of Swords is all the good qualities of the previous two books combined. The venomous political landscape in A Clash Of Kings is tempered with the action and sense of fantasy present in A Game Of Thrones. The slow pace of the previous book is most definitely not an issue here; the plot is jampacked with weddings, funerals, trials by combat, skirmishes, battles, and major character deaths. If anything, for a book this size, the pace feels almost too rushed at some points, with no real time to let the developments and tragedies sink in before someone else is brutally murdered. Nevertheless, it makes for one hell of a ride from beginning to end. I think the best aspect of this book over its predecessors is that every major character gets to actually *do* something. While in the last book, Dany mostly just wanders around listening to people tell her vague foreshadowing, we get to see her in her role as Khaleesi again, dealing with the conflicting issues of preparing for her return to Westeros, while taking care of the people she has now, as well as being mother to quickly growing dragons. But the real winner from the book's focus on action and characterization is Jaime Lannister; there is much more complexity behind the incestual Kingslayer than seen before, and he gives Tyrion a run for his money on which Lannister boy is the most morally gray. And do not, under any circumstance, skip the epilogue. A Storm Of Swords ends with a very, very changed Westeros.","2017-09-23","United States","","true","49","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1K2P84KRDMVGB"
"B000FBFN1U","5","Improving on the Fantasy for a non-fantasy fan","A Storm of Swords, being the third book in the series, had given me many expectations. Martin had to continue the many stories from the following books, while giving me a reason to want to read this as a new book, and not just yet another part of a very long tale. Why should I care about these characters and what happens to them? Will the maturity and lack of respect for the readers interests still suck me in like it did in the past (lack of respect being that we all wanted Eddard Stark to live, but for some reason having him taken away from us engaged us even more than if he had been saved)? Will Martin be able to captivate me with a new story while successfully merging past events? Move over life, because this 900+ page novel (or should I call it a collection of novels bunched into one huge masterpiece)is going to take over. Martin makes each character unique, recognizable, and with few exceptions, interesting. He kills off characters at appropriate times- meaning that although it is unexpected when he makes this decision, you are not just upset or pleased, but also satisfied with the amount of knowledge you have gained until that point- never does he make the reader feel like he introduced a character just to kill them off. The past events are continued successfully, and, to the readers enjoyment, most of the continued stories have hidden meanings and reasoning behind them that you would have never imagined. Basically, I don't generally enjoy fantasy books because of their predictability, lack of depth, and lack of great sequels, but Martin has put me in my place, because this series in unpredictable, unimaginably dense, and it is almost as if these books are not actually books- it is as if they already existed and are just glimpses into this amazing, entertaining world.","2012-05-21","United States","","true","50","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MMJBOTVY8IT"

Years later this tome is still the title I savour after A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1) and I can't recommend it enough. There are however a couple of minor negatives in A Storm of Swords that keeps this part of the epic becoming a 5 star read mostly it comes down to the side stories and to be honest, they aren't that thrilling as the rest of this volume but everyone has their favourite characters and places on the map of the Seven Kingdoms. Without giving too much away, a lot happens within these pages that were actually inspired by real-life historical events (just like the rest of this excellent series). The facts are blurred and hidden in plain sight but Mr. Martin proves that dark history can serve as gripping fiction. His pen is sharp and the wine is ready to be poured, so relax, wash the dust off from your other travels and get ready for another round.

"B000FBFN1U","5","More Of The Same... And That's Not Bad","It's hard, when you're reviewing something that's already been reviewed by hundreds of others, to come up with something original to say. Such, for me, is the case with A STORM OF SWORDS. Faced with this dilemma, I'm simply going to weigh in with all the others who've written in high praise of Martin's work. This is great stuff, and I'm not usually given to hyperbole. The characters are real. They have good days and bad days, they make mistakes, they aren't unrelentingly good or totally evil (perhaps one of two exceptions on the disagreeable side, but even these can give you a sympathetic moment somewhere along the way), they're all interesting, and they're ALL at risk. The plot twists and turns, and is full of surprises. You can never get too comfortable. Moreover, while the battle continues for the throne of the Seven Kingdoms, Princess Daenerys grows stronger across the sea and there's a sense that the ultimate fate of all lurks beyond the northern wall. It's all top-notch storytelling. Does Martin's work have some shortcomings? Sure. His prose doesn't have the elegance of Tolkien's, and he lacks Tolkien's occasional touch of whimsy or humor. These books are deadly serious and quite bloody. They're also earthy, and if you're likely to be put off by this quality, then these books may not be for you. As you probably know, A STORM OF SWORDS is the third book in Martin's A SONG OF FIRE AND ICE series. Yeah, the series title's a little melodramatic (they often are), but so far the books have been great. They're not meant to stand alone, though. A STORM OF SWORDS is much like its predecessors. If you've already read them, then this is more of the same. If you liked the others, this one definitely won't let you down. If you didn't like them, what are you doing here? If you haven't read the others, don't start here. Start with A CLASH OF KINGS. They're all five-star books, in my opinion, and I recommend them highly.","2005-03-27","United States","","true","53","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C5FMCE0ZP4UQ"
"B000FBFN1U","4","out of my genre, in love","Okay, so I never read fantasy. Like, never. I mean, I read The Hobbit in the sixth grade because it was required. Since then, nothing. But I got hooked on the HBO series for Game of Thrones. I watched the first two seasons on Netflix and then I suffered through the Facebook updates of people watching the third season. But I don't have HBO. So I decided to read the third book instead. It amuses me to listen to debates about whether George R.R. Martin is a ""good"" writer. This seems to mean very different things to different people and readability (as evidenced by popularity and awesome sales) isn't always enough. I wonder if some people put the writing down specifically because of its broad appeal. The fact that it's accessible to a majority means it can't be ""good"". For these readers, a book is only ""good"" when indecipherable to most. For me, it was in one of the first chapters of A Storm of Swords, when a low-speed sailboat chase had me on the edge of my seat, that it occurred to me that I was in the hands of a ""good"" writer. Martin's technique of killing off lead characters isn't a risk most writers are willing to take and it definitely ups the stakes. I also love the fact that these characters are so complicated. Morality is murky here and virtue often does not achieve external reward - much like in real life. Perhaps that realism is why I'm able to enjoy a book about dragons and magic. The fantasy elements are superficial; at its root, this is a story about people, relationships, and human nature. -Katie O'Rourke, author of Monsoon Season","2013-07-19","United States","","true","54","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UPDTYYRXB0DA"

"B000FBFN1U","2","Lord of the Rings This Ain't","I solemnly declare that, as I write this, I am of sound mind, and not under the influence of any mind-altering chemicals. I'm only on my first cup of coffee, so we can't even blame caffeine for what I'm about to say. This book, and this series, are mediocre at best. All these five-star reviews worry me, because this installment certainly didn't rate it. To deal in brass tacks, Martin's best aspect is his willingness to kill off main characters. It's a relief to be rid of a few people. He writes adequately. But this is going on too long, and I just don't care enough about these people (any of them) to want to read yet another 800 pages. I see that this series is scheduled for six books. Please, no! Look, guys, didn't any of you stay awake during your western civ courses, or your European history? Martin is playing with, and severely compressing, the Wars of the Roses. I don't mind, except that I'm tired to death of all these reviews raphsodizing over Martin's world-building. It's quite, quite recognizeable. Now, for these people comparing the Lord of the Rings and this stuff... Pay attention: Lord of the Rings is roughly 1200 pages. In those pages, you are presented with a world that is both recognizeable and exotic. There is heroism, and the vilest treachery, and small figures who achieve greatness. The reader is presented with a profound, wise, tolerant worldview in beautiful, lyrical, and what's more, appropriate, language. So many of us have grown up on Tolkien, we don't appreciate how extraordinary he was. More, many readers don't realize how incredibly erudite he was, and how internalized his knowledge. Middle Earth is Tolkien's personal codification of the literature and history he studied. Because most of us are pig-ignorant of that literature and history, and Tolkien's sources, we don't understand his accomplishment. Middle Earth is not a Manichean universe, as one reviewer insisted. That's an over-simplification brought on by superficial reading and Tolkien's gift for drawing us into sympathy with the protagonists. Remember, Frodo does not succeed in destroying the Ring. Gollum/Smeagol bites off the finger the Ring is on, and falls to his death, taking the Ring with him. Gandalf, the personification of ""good"", rallies and encourages the leaders of the West. But who destroys the ring-wraith king? Merry, a hobbit who hasn't done much else in the whole book except be cheerful and brave. Anyway, those are mere examples of what is great in Tolkien. By comparison, Martin's books are pitiful. In 2400 pages and counting, what have we seen? Muddled human beings, and what's more, people I, at least, can't care for. Who cares who dies? By the time I was half-way through this volume, not me. I'm tired of the whole thing. I want it over with. Unless there's a republican revolution, this stuff is boring. Martin has done his best to make some characters more sympathetic. We're supposed to change our view of certain characters because they have larger concerns than their own hides. Guess what? Everyone does, and it doesn't make them virtuous. And there is nothing, nothing happening in this book that justifies - gulp - 4800 pages. We don't need to kill this many trees. Let's start encouraging authors to finish their work in a reasonable space.","2001-01-09","United States","","true","57","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RJZ7PK5OCMAL"

The story continues its frantic pace as the characters deal with the world crumbling about them and their attempts to eek out a life for themselves seems to be constantly in vain. The story i always equate to my friends with comparison to these books is the film slumdog millionaire. The reason i mean this is because the character in slumdog goes through so much hell you almost beg for some light at the end of the tunnel. Martin makes you feel this way with a song of ice and fire. You seem to constantly hope there is going to be a break for the characters or a bit of fortune and just as you think Martin is going to give you a happy moment he kicks you in the gut. This book showed his willingness to take chances and not pander to fans he may have built with the first two books which makes its unpredictability all the more sweet. If i had one criticism of this book (I read both volumes as a whole) it is that it does seem slightly padded at times. While John Snow's story is constantly interesting, Arya's should have been edited down. A lot of what she does is important it is not all nearly essentially and found myself wondering where they were even going with her as she seemed to wander a bit too much.

This Series, ""Song of Fire ad Ice,"" is by far the best modern fantasy written today, period! In a rich and vibrant fantasy world, George R. R. Martin, creates a complex and intricate story of war, intrigue, and betrayal that is similar to the historical War of the Roses, but only much grander, and vastly more compelling. The story has something for everyone, mystery, romance, and action, but even more it creates a reality that is believable, with characters that seem real to live, some you like, some you loath, but all wonderfully interesting! This is the third book of the series, and I liked it somewhat more than book 2, yet this book is wonderful just as a whole, it completely holds the reader and demands you to spend hours lost in this vibrant world of intrigue and conflict. There is some violence, yet is no more than many comparable works, less than ""The Return of the King,"" by JRRT, and it certainly fits into a medieval fantasy war story. The sexual content touches on adult themes, but it is not anywhere as graphic as most aimed at an adult audience, anyone over the age of 16 should be able to handle this book. In fact the most disturbing sexual content in books 1 thru 4 is a retelling of an event that happens years before the events of the story. p.s.

These in turn make many reconsider their allegiances. Both Lannister and Stark struggle to secure new allies, and hold onto old ones. The story shifts back to political intrigue, with each side struggling to make the right choice. Revelations abound as plans come to fruition; requiring readers to reevaluate characters and events from the beginning. The book also continues the stories of Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen, but while they represent a solid quarter of the book’s chapters, it’s in the politics of the Lannister, Stark, and Baratheon that this book shines; skillfully using Arya and Davos to continue demonstrating how the choices of great lords often fall upon the common folk like ruinous storms. The story never lets audiences forget the horror of war, and the reality that even the victor pays a heavy price. This is the longest book so far in the series, with 74 chapters and 10 distinct perspectives. For many characters their story is told on the road, encountering new characters with each chapter. There are little touches of humor from time to time, but like its predecessors, Storm of Swords is a grim book, where amoral schemers often receive the richest rewards. +Strong characters +Strong plot, with rich twists +Strong ideas, with 10 perspectives +Touches of humor *Grim 4/5","2016-06-24","United States","","true","64","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RELFP9753SSAA"

It is like no story I ever listened to before because the number of people and places in the story, the amount of detail about everything in the stoy, and the lack of a main character, there are main people in the story but you never know when one is going to die, it is almost like a very long history lesson from a parallel universe than a story following a few main characters. All the way from the start to where the stoy is now I never know what is going to happen, one minute I am laughing, a few hours later I am crying, and then later I am screaming in anger, it is a great ride! Like I said before they are long, I would never have time to read them, only people who read really fast should read them because if you are a slow reader by the time you finish you will forget what happens in the begining, reading puts me to sleep so I have listen to them over and over again and pick up on something new every time.

Where's the powerful magician coming to visit the town? How about a mysterious stranger lending a life saving aid? Someone whose name most resembles Tolkien (two middle names initial r. r.?) writes a great fantasy novel devoid of significant similarities (I mean how can any author not have similarities to Tolkien even a little while writing anything 'fantasy'?). Well G.R.R. Martin certainly did just that. As if on a quest to break the major rules of fantasy writing, anyone who's dead tends to stay dead on his series. And the 'good' guys are not impervious to death either. I find it refreshing for an author to be so definite and bold. And his boldness doesn't in any way mar his great story. Quite the opposite, it lends to the story and briskly carries the story along (and on some cases too brisk, but that's nit-picking). I don't know who started having more main characters then can be counted with one hands (Robert Jordan jumps to mind) but I do find it distorting to read couple of chapter about one character and to have it abrubtly end to start fresh with another. I'll tell it straight off, I don't like reading about certain character's exploits. On the topic of stating the cons, I've heard some people not liking this series due to its overt amount of sexual content. Sexual content - more stronger then your average fantasy fair (ok, more so then ALL the other fantasy series) but I don't find it in any way to be 'overt'ly sexual. Lovely series thus far.

Adventure, suspense, sex, you name it and this series has it. The fantasy elements are unobtrusive and work perfectly. I am not generally much of a fantasy fan, but this really seems more like historical fiction: knights and maidens, etc. (Don't worry, the maidens are FAR from helpless pawns, many times.) I really think the series compares favorably with the Lord of the Rings-it's that good! This third book of the series does not disappoint. We are constantly updated about each main character's struggles. Some scenes are difficult to take, being full of gore and viciousness, but you can console yourself that it is not real. Good triumphs over evil just often enough to keep you reading, but the personalities of the major players are pretty complex. It is not so easy to decide just who is good and who isn't, at all times. The author is known as one who will kill off a favorite, too, so be prepared. ""Storm of Swords"" continues the story of the clash of various would-be kings, and the fascinating mistress of dragons who is coming from afar to reclaim the throne that is rightfully hers.

The first book sets the laws and rules for the books, but I feel that the concept has been abuse. Mr. Martin's books go under the premise that in real life the good guys lose too, and can't always come out victorious. There is here the fault is starting show. I understand the concept, but he takes this to an extreme. They good guys are completely stupid in comparison to the ''bad'' guys. There is no real bad guys here because everyone acts according to their own plan, but the book give you a feeling, that only the spiteful come ahead and are so lucky...then author comes around doing 180 turn and every character that deserve to die...dies??? After that turn the book leaves the ""Starks must suffer"" motto, and finally starts moving the story forward. He keeps on building the characters he has so masterfully created, like Tyrion, danearys, and Jaime. The writing is superb and is masterfully crafted, and even do the JOB changes from character to character, it chapters feel like a continuation. Little is left in the book's universe that is only showed to the readers knowledge and not other characters. Overall is fantastic book but it seems the series is going to serious of events that are just their for the shock value.

Things seemed to be going along (business as usual) with no major changes coming until around the middle of the book. Kings were dying left and right, and plotting was everywhere. I really got into the book the last few hundred pages as I could tell things would be happening. I think this is the best of the first four books; even though there is still a lot of wasted time and words, the book has a story (I would say plot but myriad plots would be more apt), and the characters twist, turn, and some even survive. Still, it was sweet when one of my most disliked characters perished (via poison)in a marriage feast. I don't want to spoil the story, so I am being type lipped about which characters fell under the axe (or the quiver or whatever), but suffice to say, it was numerous. It is interesting that none of the characters are totally ""good"" or ""bad""; some, like Jamie, seem to be mellowing and showing more maturity and even tolerance. Probably the only real stretching the imagination is the revival of one of the Starks at the end of the book. Later we learn more about how (in the next book) this resurrection came about, but I digress. Bits of magic or hints seem to be turning up more and more. In some places the author is planting seeds for future books and muddying the waters as to what is going to happen next.","2011-09-18","United States","","true","72","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GX9MAHSGV4P3"
"B000FBFN1U","4","Martin Keeps Pace","George R.R. Martin is a captivating writer, but this book took me much longer to read than the first and second chapters in the series. It is not that the story is any less compelling or the plot less exciting (or twisty), but that it takes a while to let the action percolate. The first half of the book is a bit static, with a deliberately slower pace than much of what preceded it. Once the action starts, however, it is hard to keep up. This is also the most fantastic of the books so far - the dragons are bigger and more active, the white walkers are there, giants, etc. They are all in abundance. Despite that, Martin manages to keep the story very grounded and visceral, preferring to avoid lingering on those same fantastical elements and instead focusing on the inner monologues of the characters involved. Of the first three books, this is probably the weakest. That said, it is also probably the deepest and most lived in. While reading, it is clear that Martin by this point has fully realized the world he is portraying. He may not have every last story beat of the series in place, but the laws of the universe seem to be bedrock and the story merely the house on top. I am looking forward to the fourth book...

Martin is a master of making you believe you are being led somewhere by the nose, somewhere safe, or at least somewhere expected. Quick as a flash the chapter is over and you don't know whether the character you've been following for two and a half novels is alive or dead, and it all happens so suddenly and unexpectedly: just like real life. To be sure, comparisons could be drawn (and are drawn) to Tolkien, but the difference is in the existentialism of a song of ice and fire: the characters are real humans, not flawless heroes, and some of them stumble through life until the next thing happens to them - they remind you of someone you actually know, not just someone you wish could be real. Because of this, when the magical events happen, they seem far more miraculous than in the world of Lord of the rings, where such events are almost commonplace or expected. The betrayals are bigger and more bitter. The revenge, sweeter. The tragedy, far more devastating; the battles more bloody and more personal than the first two books. The past is further examined through some well- placed storytelling that actually reads like a Tolkien tale - until the tale is done.

"B000FBFN1U","5","Simply better than the rest.","I, too, reviewed the previous volumes and only add my voice now to confirm what everyone has said. This third installment is everything the first two were and more. It is the first time in my experience that a series has so approached The Lord of The Ring's standard of conflicted characters and intertwined destinies, set against a backdrop of medieval action and only _hints_ of the magical. I hadn't realized how tired I was of reading the same basic story of a male hero tromping off to some absurdly spectacular destiny with only the details needing to be filled in, until I began these novels. If you're bored by the bloated tedium of Jordan's 97th Wheel of Time book, or the unremittingly strict good/evil character categories of others such as Eddings or Brooks, welcome. You will not be disappointed. My only complaint, albeit a very minor one, is that as the plots in this third volume are shredded and rewoven during its telling, Martin does loose his grip a bit by allowing each viewpoint chapter to end with a cliffhanger. Predictably unpredictable, you find yourself dreading that last paragraph simply because you know something terrible is going to happen. This is likely intentional, as befitting the chaos of the time, but it is a departure from the earlier books. Finally, I wish to point out (as others may have) that you may find a short story written by Martin and set about 100 years before The Song of Fire And Ice in 'Legends 2' (""The Hedge Knight""). This is the softcover version of 'Legends', and contains only two other short stories in addition to Martin's. This is fine, however, because Martin's tale is so superior I felt glad that no other people were forced to share the fate of being outshone by him.","2000-11-13","United States","","true","75","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RO6WY7KZ6QIX3"
"B000FBFN1U","5","The Best Just Keeps Getting Better!","I'll keep this short and sweet: Take everything you know about formulaic fantasy writing and throw it out the window. In his remarkable series of books, A Song of Ice and Fire, George R.R. Martin breaks all the rules of the genre' and has created perhaps the best epic fantasy series of all time! There is nothing predictable about this story; nothing that you may have read before prepares you for the scale and originality of Martin's vision. The characters don't follow the tired, hackneyed paths found in countless other fantasy novels, and I guarantee that you'll be genuinely surprised at least a dozen times while reading these books. The First two books in the series primarily followed the destinies of the Stark family throughout the Seven Kingdoms. In this third book you will discover many new and startling revelations about this family which will rock you to the core and forever change your expectations. The pernicious Lannisters also come into sharper focus, again shifting your perceptions and feelings towards them. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this book is the ever evolving side story of Daenerys, surely major foreshadowing here of books yet to be written! And unlike other writers, (Robert Jordan jumps to mind) you can be sure that something is really going to happen, and soon. Each chapter in this third book is a delight to read, and every turn of the page brings a new revelation. I've enjoyed all these books enormously; indeed I'll go so far as to say they are the best books I've read in 15 years or more!

"B000FBFN1U","3","Danger Sign","Martin does not disappoint in this third installment of his series. The characters live their believable and complex lives, the action moves forward, and new characters have been introduced for the most part seamlessly. The Red Wedding merits its attention as both a gorefest and a major turning point. Did not, for example, see Roose Bolton's treachery tied to this, though the author deftly plants the evidence along the way. However, there is a major danger sign. Point of view is becoming a weakness rather than a strength. The strength of multiple points of view is that the author can explore the same plot line through the perspective of multiple characters, adding or omitting information as needed to create tension. The weakness is that each new point of view character may launch his or her own subplot. It is in this second direction that I see the series progressing. The number of point-of-view characters seems to be expanding as the series goes along (I'm purposely restraining myself from looking ahead so that I won't see if I am correct or wrong in my guesses), and with some of these new characters, we are seeing new subplots and the creation of a whole new list of character names to memorize--a choice that invariably leads to uneven story development. Some of the storylines, such as Sansa's and Arya's, tend to go nowhere as a result. Some storylines, such as the fate of Theon Greyjoy and Rickon Stark, are completely ignored. Strange gaps in others, such as the omission of Samwell and Gilly's meeting with Coldhands, or Daenerys's capture of Meereen, develop as the narrative tries to bring itself back up to speed. These expansions and inconsistencies in the storytelling, if not curbed now, may lead to problems in the future books. It's also disappointing that the characters seem to have have missed an obvious clue to one of the mysteries threaded through the story: the ongoing subplot of the attempted murder of Bran Stark in book 1. Why is it that no one has thought to tie Littlefinger to the attempt when it was his knife that the assassin used? No one believes any longer in Littlefinger's initial defense that the knife had passed to Tyrion Lannister, yet instead of suspecting the owner of the knife, Jaime, for example, actually entertains the idea that Joffrey, his nephew, may have been behind the attempt. I am looking forward to book 4 to see how the storylines continue.","2013-12-01","United States","","true","77","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FX6YQC5OUYR8"

The Song of Ice and Fire series is told third person past tense from multiple points of view with a cast of thousands. Brandon Sanderson’s Stormlight Archive series is the same way. The first three books in The Song of Ice and Fire series knocked my socks off, and I didn’t even read them until after I had seen the first two seasons of the Game of Thrones HBO series. Since then I’ve accumulated six hardcovers in the Westeros universe, and six seasons on disc. Only two seasons left of the TV show, thirteen episodes, and Game of Thrones is history. I’m already looking for my next favorite TV series. When I’m not watching episodic storytelling I’m reading, everything from nonfiction to westerns, but at least half of my time is spent reading sci-fi and fantasy. Sci-fi and fantasy authors I like include Douglas Adams, Isaac Asimov, Paolo Bacigalupi, Ray Bradbury, Orson Scott Card, Arthur C. Clarke, Earnest Cline, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, William R. Forstchen, Joe Haldeman, Robert A. Heinlein, Frank Herbert, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Larry Niven, Andre Norton, George Orwell, Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, John Steakley, J.R.R.

Each book is better than the last.Whether you watch the TV show or read the books first, they compliment each other so well. I watched the first 3 HBO seasons prior to reading the A Song of Ice and Fire series and definitely recommend reading the books. George R.R. Martin does a fantastic job writing this fantasy and HBO does a wonderful job of capturing everything from the books. This book has a fresh appearance to the land of Westeros and Esteros. New characters are introduced, with new families, cities, and storylines. George describes the lands and cities only mentioned in the first two books, while building onto the other current plots. It is an amazing read with lots of plot climaxes and jaw dropping chapters. I usually read books very slowly, a chapter a day when I have time, but with the Game of Thrones series I have not been able to put the book down. Every chapter leaves me on the edge of my seat wondering what could happen next. Seeing the title of the next chapter I am forced to continue reading because my excitement over powers my ability to put the book down. I highly recommend both reading and watching the Game of Thrones series, because it is an outstanding piece of work.

Well, there is not much I can say about this book without giving out many details and taking away the surprise out of it, so I'm just going to say it's even better that the second one. This one is more a page turner than A Clash of Kings. The story takes many unexpected turns and you get surprised by many of the characters outcomes and decisions. It's amazing what families can do to achieve or maintain power, not only to other families but among themselves. This book in particular gives you much more adventure and excitement in battles and encounters. As I read on, I like Jamie more and more, regardless of what he's done before. I enjoy how Tyrion works things out and the brilliant mind he has. I still don't like the Regent Queen a bit, but I love the woman Daenerys is turning out to be. Things also get more interesting at The Wall. We get to read more about Jon and Samwell and their whereabouts. Stannis Baratheon is turning out to be quite a character himself, we have to keep an eye on him too, as well as some of the family members of House Tyrell. And one of my favorite characters, Arya Stark is worth following on this book. She's really turning out to be an amazing young lady, and the way it looks House Stark will give us some surprises too.","2011-09-09","United States","","true","80","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EYYHHF9RP886"
"B000FBFN1U","5","From A Very Pleased Reader","First off, I bought this book for my kindle after watching the first 2 books play out as a TV series. So, naturally there were some continuity issues, but they were so minor that you could easily read on without any difficulty whatsoever. Also, I was extremely pleased about how this author isn't afraid to kill off some main character that everyone loves (as mentioned by a previous reviewer). This is in such a STARK contrast (haha, play on words) to other series I have read where the heroes face their demise countless times without so much as a scratch on them. With this series, Martin isn't afraid to do what every other author I've ever read does, all the while keeping you on the edge of your seat trying to guess what's coming next. This is an absolute masterpiece in terms of the complexity of all the characters and events, and I can't help but marvel at how well everything/everyone is interwoven in a perfectly meshed masterpiece. It's definitely not a book for some light reading, but for a reader like me, who thinks that all good books are too short, this book was pleasing in that it actually took me some time to get through it. All in all, this is an amazing series that I will definitely be continuing as soon as I can buy the next book. Get this book. You will not be displeased in any way. You can thank me later.","2013-04-20","United States","","true","81","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CK7XXKF9O5TG"

GRRM rewards readers who have stuck through the pain and the length and quite a bit of detail on the history and background of the characters is provided. There are so many big reveals in this book, I think if I had put status updates for each reveal every one of my status updates would have been, ""WTF?!"" Yes, there is pain and loss in this book and GRRM raises the description of gore and violence to a level I did not imagine was possible. But despite the pain and the violence, I cannot wait to read Feast of Crows. Spoilers below. And wow all the events have happened and been put in play because Petyr/Littlefinger wanted Cat and plotted to get her husband killed. I was very dissapointed for Jon that he didn't go to Winterfell. But so nice to have Ghost back. I just wish Arya could be reunited with her wolf; I am sure it is coming. It was also very frustrating to have Bran and Jon so close yet never meet and Arya and her mother so close and never meet. The deaths of the Hound, the Mountain, and Joffrey were very very satisfying. Perhaps the Hound appears to redeem himself and yes he has had a horrible life, but ultimately he is not a good actor and I am glad to see him gone.","2011-12-23","United States","","true","82","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NBPCWNDXJYQK"

The first half of the of the book proceeds in a straightforward fashion, but the second half strings together 6 (by my count) events that remain iconic in the series. Plot twists abound.

I truly fell in love with the series in this book. Is it possible that up until now I was just trying to get through because I already knew what happened? Maybe? But this book is where we see a bit more of people becoming who they are meant to be. Characters aren't great unless they evolve somehow. Static characters don't stick with you. GRRM's characters are quite dynamic. There characters you love to hate and those you hate to love, but not many you'll feel indifferent about, especially after this book! The plot twists will make your head spin! Just when you think you've had all you can take, there's a ton more intrigue, drama and betrayal thrown at you. This is the book during which my husband thought there was something wrong with me because I kept reacting to events out loud. It was so hard not to! You need someone else who has read these so you can discuss. I went right from book one to book two and right from two to three. I took a week off for lighter fare after this because this book was so intense. That is a good thing. i had to let it process and mull it over before I could move on. Huzzah, GRRM!

"B000FBFN1U","2","Rape is Not Sex,Dark Violence is Not Fantasy;Brilliant Writing","I have read the first three books of the ""Game Of Thrones"" series, and have been loathe to write a review. The author is a superb writer. It is so difficult to write at his level that I feel uncomfortable with what I have to say. Without question, it is his writing that has carried me through some of the more complex or slow areas of each of the books. I find myself truly able to suspend disbelief; for me that is both good and bad in this series. Let me say that I would not recommend this even for teenaged readers. I am not sure I would recommend it to young adults! While even the sex (please let us not confuse rape and molestation with sex?) is not particularly healthy, the violence is extreme and sudden. I have read many novels of all genres in my sixty years, yet few have effected me with such depression and sadness. I won't be a spoiler when it comes to this book; suffice it to say that I could not go on to the fourth book right away, and am not sure I will pick it up at all. There have been many complaints about the amount of sex in this series; my complaint is that rape and forced sex is not just ""sex"". When my kids were growing up, I never objected to nudity or sex, but I would not let them watch or read media which contained unhealthy sex or violence. My theory was that I hoped that they would grow up to enjoy healthy sex, but I prayed that they would not be subjected to or enjoy violence. (One might have laughed watching my husband try to cover the eyes of one of our sons during a particularly lascivious sex scene in a movie while I giggled. But, this is DIFFERENT.). Martin, throughout this series is exploring the darkest side of mankind. I used to think that this belonged in the ""horror"" genre. I have to believe that this writer has a kinder and gentler worldview in some of his other books? While many of us have had to live with terrible grief in our lives, we go to the fantasy genre to avoid the macabre. These books are no vacation from the real world. While particularly absorbing, they are emotionally exhausting. My recommendation is that if you love the t.v. series (and we do, with some similar reservations, at least to date), and decide to read all of these books,try not to invest emotionally in any character as it is not easy to be sure who is hero and who is villain; their fates are as realistic as if they were living in harsh feudal times. This stuff is DARK; very DARK. I would love to read other books by this author which have similarly well written plots and character development, but were on the less and horrible spectrum of fanstasy. After all, Tolkien managed to give us more realistic elves (some that were truly not good hearted) without depressing us or making our stomachs roil over the fate of charcters in which we had a two book investment. I am made of fairly tough stuff, yet I was depressed and nauseated at the end of this book.","2012-06-03","United States","","true","85","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HLSD2RNU46SF"
"B000FBFN1U","5","Unbelievable","It is incredibly difficult to put into words how you feel after reading George RR Martin's work. There are many before me who have written extensive reviews of the books in A Song of Ice and Fire and I feel there is little I could really add or detract from any of them. To put it simply, if you are a fan of fantasy, and I mean from a casual reader who picks up a novel every couple of years or a die-hard fanatic, Martin's books are worth their weight in gold. The story is incredibly rich with detail, history, action and most importantly, intrigue. It is not written in the epic nature of the Lord of the Rings but challenges Tolkien's great work by instead offering a reader a world of fantasy that is startling similar to our own. Martin's realism, proven by his extensive historical research and adept knowledge of human nature, is what raises these books toward becoming classics. Like any other fan of the books, I can't say enough how much you should read them. Do not feel intimidated by their size as you will quickly move through the books once you are entrapped in the stirring stories. Go buy this and the other books. Hopefully Martin will finish the series within the next ten years...","2007-09-03","United States","","true","86","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQDWUO20T3BDG"
"B000FBFN1U","5","Still great, but aprehensive now.","I have read several reviews of readers complaining about books 4 and 5 of this series. I just finished book 3 and I still find the plot engrossing and the characters rich and consistent. It's quite true that the author is overly descriptive quite often. We don't really need to know in detail what is being served for each meal, nor must we read about every single ornament found in the characters' clothes. Sometimes we are also thrown off rhythm by extremely lengthy - and unnecessary really - descriptions of dreams and thoughts. The book could be shortened by a quarter without losing any of its appeal and magic. I'm also following HBO's adaptation and while the screenplay made a good job at simplifying the plot and roster of characters, I find the books much more compelling. A lot of the analyses concerning strategic options are lost on TV. That's a very critical part of the narrative. Besides, HBO has clearly censored some of the more unconventional parts. All characters on TV have the legal age for sex and alcohol. Besides, kids are less brutal and none of them are responsible for killings, which is not really credible or compatible with the brutality of the societies where the story develops. I'm approaching books 4 and 5 with ominous feelings that I'll also be disappointed with the coming installments.

"B000FBFN1U","3","Clunky writing but utterly compelling.","I came to this book virtually a fantasy virgin, motivated only by a desire to know what happened after the second season of the TV show. Some may consider it somewhat sacrilegious to pick up the series on book three and in hindsight (having now finishing book five) I wish I'd started at the beginning. The writing annoyed me at first. Irritatingly descriptive and filled with cheap attempts at ""medieval"" language like ""half a hundred"" instead of ""fifty"", and nerdy invented words like ""roundtower"" instead of ""round tower"", GRRM's prose feels lumbering and clumsy. His insistence that every character ""break his fast"", instead of just eating ""BREAKFAST"" made me shudder every time I read it. Which happened probably half a hundred times. Still, what got me in the end was the structure. Each chapter is told from the third person perspective of a different character, and the slow building of interlocking plots and end-of-chapter cliffhangers made it nearly unputdownable, which was a curse as the book is so huge. Structurally the story is a mirror of Irvine Welsh's ""Porno"", albeit with far more characters and slightly less anal sex. The other redeeming feature was GRRM's fearlessness in killing off main characters. As a reader you feel very insecure and read every battle with a real sense of tension knowing that no one is safe. Reading it on a kindle was kind of depressing as you only have the percentage numbers to keep track of your progress - rather than physical pages, so you can be reading for half an hour before you finally click over a percentage point - and then at 94% the book suddenly finishes and you realise you were not prepared - frustrating and demoralising. (But in no way a reason to go back to those dusty, crippled tools of the dark ages). I read GoT3 at the same time as Jane Austin's Sense and Sensibility and I highly recommend doing the same. Whereas Austin had a command of english that GRRM can only fap over, not heaps happens in her books, so when you get bored with beautifully written parlour intrigue, you can switch back over to rape and murder. Unfortunately I was only 44% through GoT when I finished S&S and was forced to endure the remaining 1000 or so pages uninterrupted.","2013-01-14","United States","","true","89","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DWBXKH9890V5"

I have to say, by 3/4ths of the way through this book - the TV show has diverged so far that it's like 2 different stories. Similar, with characters that are clearly based on the books. The thing that seems to be happening is, to keep the number of characters down (and save time) that they are omitting some characters and fusing others together. That has driven the TV show in a slightly different direction. Regardless, after being dropped into Westeros unceremoniously in the first book - here in the second, the author seems to have found his stride and came to terms with fusing back story into progress. I noticed his use of stories and songs, within the story, to carry history and serve as cautionary tails. Anyway, it's been a fantastic read. A fantastical, world spanning epic. And I can't wait to see what happens as magic reawakens into the world and the night comes.

I can complain that at some times the book did something that was fully expected. However, these incidents are very few and far between. There are the occasions where I had no clue that something was about to happen, and when it did, I was shocked or thrilled. My ONLY complaint about this book in particular was several times during the course of reading, something would happen and nothing surrounding the incident would be explained before or after. Maybe all will be revealed in a later book, but I do not like such big gaps in the story at these times. I want so badly to explain, but if I do, there will certainly be a spoiler... Most importantly, I have not grown tired of these books or their characters. There are horrendous pitfalls for the ""good"" characters that make you scream ""WTF?!

Along with a riveting story.....did I mention it's a great read?!!!","2014-05-08","United States","","true","98","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LTVQ8VATROKR"
"B000FBFN1U","5","Pop Culture Breakdown","The Good: I continue to read this series in utter disbelief. Jaw hanging open, more often than not. I struggled reading A Storm of Swords - reading as fast as possible to find out what was going to happen next, while trying to slow myself down enough so I didn't miss anything. It's hard to explain my addiction to this series. The characters are so good. So well developed. So complex, that we keep uncovering things we never expected. I am constantly surprised at every plot twist, yet I know I should expect the unexpected at every turn. Nothing is ever as it seems, even when it couldn't possibly be other. If that makes sense. The writing in these books gets under your skin. Martin making you question your initial opinions. Making you love the characters you should be hating. Making you root for things that make you a very bad person. It sort of makes you crazy in the best possible way. The Bad: Not a thing.","2015-09-17","United States","","true","99","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FB4YE1NX2QXH"
"B000FBFN1U","5","It took 50 years, but GoT has displaced Lord of the Rings in my mind as the greatest fantasy story ever.","If you liked the TV Series, you'll love the books. Both have much to recommend them and reading the books will enrich your enjoyment of the series. Even if you never see the series though, you will still enjoy the books. The characters are finely drawn, the dialogue brilliant, the plot fascinating and full of surprises. It IS a fantasy, and as such there are elements of magic, dragons, etc. but nevertheless it is a very human tale and it is the relationships between the many characters that lifts the story into the realm of great literature. There IS a great deal of death and violence which some may find troubling. Of course, no amount of words can shock and disturb quite like the TV series, with its special effects depictions of beheadings, burning at the stake and flayings, but Martin's written descriptions still do a great job of leaving one horrified. Perhaps the most horrifying thing is knowing that everything depicted has happened in the real world and still does in some places.","2015-11-29","United States","","true","100","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LH82JEF0O58U"
