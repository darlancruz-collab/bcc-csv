"B000FC1HBY","5","Superlative series; GRRM does it again!!!","First off, I'm a heavy duty fan of GRRM. I've read over a 100 different fantasy authors in my time (started at 12; I'm now 32). Took about 5 years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic and cliched. Typical archetype character who turns out to be the missing heir or boy wonder who saves the world against the Dark Lord. So, when I came back to fantasy at the end of 1999, I read the usual: Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then someone told me about GRRM and man, that was the kicker! Here are the reasons to choose GRRM. I've also listed the reasons not to choose him to make it fair b/c I know their are certain personalities who won't like this series: WHY TO READ GRRM (1) YOU ARE TIRED OF FORMULAIC FANTASY: good lad beats the dark lord against impossible odds; boy is the epitome of good; he and all his friends never die even though they go through great dangers . . . the good and noble king; the beautiful princess who falls in love with the commoner boy even though their stations are drastically different . . . the dark lord is very evil and almost one sided at times . . . you get the idea. After reading this over and over, it gets old. (2) YOU ARE TIRED OF ALL THE HEROES STAYING ALIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDER CONSTANT DANGER: this gets even worse where the author kills a main hero off but that person comes back later in the story. Or, a hero does die but magic brings him back. This sometimes carries to minor characters where even they may not die, but most fantasy authors like to kill them off to show that some risked the adventure and perished. (3) YOU ARE A MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFF: this story was influenced by the WARS OF THE ROSES and THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR. (4) YOU LOVE SERIOUS INTRIGUE WITHOUT STUPID OPPONENTS: lots of layering; lots of intrigue; lots of clever players in the game of thrones. Unlike other fantasy novels, one side, usually the villain, is stupid or not too bright. (5) YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BIASED OPINIONS AND DIFFERENT TRUTHS: GRRM has set this up where each chapter has the title of one character and the whole chapter is through their viewpoint. Interesting tidbit is that you get their perception of events or truths. But, if you pay attention, someone else will mention a different angle of truth in the story that we rarely see in other novels. Lastly and most importantly, GRRM doesn't try to tell us which person is right in their perception. He purposelly leaves it vague so that we are kept guessing. (6) LEGENDS: some of the most interesting characters are those who are long gone or dead. We never get the entire story but only bits and pieces; something that other fantasy authors could learn from to heighten suspense. Additionally, b/c the points of views are not congruent, we sometimes get different opinions. (7) WORDPLAY: if you're big on metaphors and description, GRRM is your guy. Almost flawless flow. (8) LOTS OF CONFLICT: all types, too; not just fighting but between characters through threats and intrigue. (9) MULTILAYERED PLOTTING; SUB PLOTS GALORE: each character has their own separate storyline; especially as the story continues and everyone gets scattered. This is one of the reasons why each novel is between 700-900 pages. (10) SUPERLATIVE VARIED CHARACTERS: not the typical archetypes that we are used to in most fantasy; some are gritty; few are totally evil or good; GRRM does a great job of changing our opinions of characters as the series progress. This is especially true of Jaime in book three. (11) REALISTIC MEDIEVAL DIALOGUE: not to the point that we can't understand it but well done. (12) HEAPS OF SYMOBLISM AND PROPHECY: if you're big on that. (13) EXCELLENT MYSTERIES: very hard to figure out the culprits; GRRM must have read a lot of mystery novels. (14) RICHLY TEXTURED FEMALE CHARACTERS: best male author on female characters I have read; realistic on how women think, too. (15) LOW MAGIC WORLD: magic is low key; not over the top so heroes can't get out of jams with it. REASON TO NOT READ GRRM (1) YOU LIKE YOUR MAIN CHARACTERS: GRRM does a good job of creating more likeable characters after a few die. But, if that isn't your style, you shouldn't be reading it. He kills off several, not just one, so be warned. (2) DO NOT CARE FOR GRITTY GRAY CHARACTERS: if you like more white and gray characters, this may unsettle you. I suggest Feist or Goodkind or Dragonlance if you want a more straight forward story with strong archetypes. (3) MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEWS TURN YOU OFF: if you prefer that the POVS only go to a few characters, this might be confusing for you. (4) SWEARING, SEX: there's a lot of it in this book just as there is in real life. If you have delicate ears, this book may upset you. (5) YOU DEMAND CLOSURE AT THE END OF EVERY BOOK: this isn't the case for all stories in the series. Some are still going on; some have been resolved; others have been created and are moving on. (6) IF YOU WANT A TARGET OR SOMEONE TO BLAME: this can be done to some extent but not as much. This is b/c he doesn't try to make anyone necessarily good or evil. (7) ARCHETYPES: some readers like archetypal characters because it's comfortable; we like the good young hero (sort of like Pug in Feist's THE RIFTWAR SAGA); it's familiar and we sometimes like to pretend we're this upcoming, great hero. You wont' get much of this in GRRM with the exception of one or two characters. There really aren't any super heroes compared to all the other characters as it's more grittier and no one is shooting fireballs every milisecond or carrying around some super powerful sword. (8) LENGTH: you don't want to get into a long fantasy epic series. In that case, look for shorters works as this is biiig. (9) PATRIARCHY: men are most of the main characters with lots of power (one female exception). While this is realistic of the medieval era, some readers may not prefer this if they want more girl power, so to speak. By the way, if you don't want to commit to a big book until you know the author better, check out his short story, THE HEDGE KNIGHT, in LEGENDS. Overall, this is a great series and I happily purchase the hard cover when it comes out...","2001-04-07","United States","","true","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAQDX8BJ2G5RJ"
"B000FC1HBY","5","highest highs and lowest lows.","Pre-review note for fans of the TV show Game of Thrones: If you've ever thought to yourself, ""Gee, I love this show so much I'd like to read the books, but the first season of the show is supposed to be so faithful to the first book, and I don't want to read 800 pages of stuff I already know,"" and wondered if you should just start with book 2, A CLASH OF KINGS, here is what you need to know. Yes, you are safe skipping book one. You'll miss out on some worldbuilding & backstory, which are neat, but you won't feel lost. And yes, unlike Season 1/Book 1, there are some pretty major differences between Season 2 of the show and A CLASH OF KINGS. The list of changes is long, and some of the differences really surprised me. And now on to the review. I think? Maybe? Because it's hard to write a review when I have no distance. I haven't been so obsessed with a book in a really long while. I haven't felt so immersed or engaged, so eager to find out what happens next (yes, even though I already know). I want to read, and then I want to talk about what I'm reading, and then I want to read some more. This is not my usual sort of book. Good characters meet bad ends. The characters I root for are hurt and hurt and hurt again, and there's no reason to believe they've got a reward in store during the as-yet-unwritten finale. I think: Oh, I should not love Arya so much, I should not love Bran so much, or Daenerys or Tyrion. They can't all win. They're not going to make friends and get along. But I can't help it. It's hard to explain why anyone should read this series. It seems like an act of masochism, doesn't it? That's part of the reason why I avoided it for so long. But a book that can hurt you is a book that can move you in other ways, too. And the good moments, the character growth, the triumphs...man, they are so satisfying. I read a blog post that pointed out something obvious I should have seen myself. The classic fantasy plot is about a young man who becomes King. That's the trajectory; rising to power is success. And this is a novel with ostensibly the same plot -- there's a throne, it's in jeopardy -- but the books are about the people who surround the kings. The wives, the sisters and brothers, the advisors and vassals. The contenders to the throne (with the exception of Daenerys, who starts the book ruling a clan of 50 people) aren't our POV characters. A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE is a total inversion...and attaining power, in this world, is just as dangerous as losing it. I love the way that GRR Martin has set up the Houses, with images that stick in your mind like burrowing worms. Winter is coming. The iron price. A Lannister always pays his debts. He keeps this sprawling world and cast comprehensible because the imagery is so succinct and memorable. But each character interprets their own family legacy in a unique way. Despite the importance of family, despite that strong stamp of imagery, biology isn't destiny. Some of the Lannisters are foolish (Lancel? Yeesh), and their family words can be a doom or a blessing, depending on who's talking. Every character can choose, can do what's expected or what's easy or what's safe, to seek advantage or do what's right. So the simple image, the character of the family in the words and the banner, is elaborated, extended, perverted or rejected. The same with gender roles. There are characters -- especially the older characters -- that that fit the common types. Men who fight and lead. Women who look pretty and offer support. But those are the minority. Among the men, key characters include a dwarf, a eunuch, a cripple, a fat bookworm. Awesome characters that you love and root for, and you see how strong and capable they are, even if not a one of them looks pretty sitting on a horse in armor. The women hold their own in politics, but the book includes two key women who are evolving as fighters, driven by vengeance, who don't need to be pretty to be compelling or important. At this point, I feel like the series is about change. The characters who survive are the characters who adapt. I think I have been blathering on for a while now. To sum up: personally, I really enjoyed A CLASH OF KINGS. It pulled me deeper into the world, made me more attached to the characters. This is one of those series where more is really more.","2013-06-06","United States","","true","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HMQ4G9WEIKMI"
"B000FC1HBY","4","""A Game of Good-Choice, Bad-Choice""","this review really relates to the first 3 books: I love the way the series changes perspective from chapter to chapter. You really get inside the heads of a lot of characters that way, and I tend to believe that characters are everything in storytelling. That's a personal quirk and not true for everyone, so take the rest of my critique with a corresponding grain of salt. I think there's a good balance of pure pseudo-historical adventure story with subtle fantasy elements without being too in-your-face fantasy. It takes place in a kingdom that believes magic and magical creatures no longer exist except in very subtle holdover ways, like the occasional witch-type character, but those are a rarity and viewed skeptically. As you move thorugh the books, some of this supposedly dead magic turns out to be not so dead, but it's not like a Dungeons and Dragons world where trolls and wizards run amock. So it doesn't have a ""kitsch"" problem the way some bad fantasy novels do. (Need I mention the trite regurgitated Eragon dragon series so lauded by critics a few years ago? I mean, yes, it was good for being written by a 16-year-old, but that doesn't make it actually good.) As I said, the ""magical"" parts are subtle and the characters treat them with uncertainty and suspicion. The supernatural aspects are almost peripheral to the main plot, at least in Book 2. As with the first book, the subsequent ones focus on the Stark family, and we get chapters on all of them regularly (eldest brother Robb trying to be a ""man"" at 16; bastard brother Jon who was sent North to the Wall; the two sisters - one dreaming of being a queen, the other learning the art of the sword; 8-year-old Bran who fell off the roof early in the first book; 4-year-old Rickon who has yet to really develop as a character). The children's connection to their direwolves continues to fascinate me; the animal on the family crest who appears to be connected to the family line more than metaphorically... This potentially supernatural element seems to solidify that the Starks are the true focus of the overall story. But other major players on the chessboard of this ""game"" also become near and dear to the reader (Tyrion Lannister, ""the Imp,"" we love you!), even some who are less than admirable. Some of the surlier characters introduced as ""bad guys"" (Sandor Clegane, i.e., ""the Hound"") have their heartfelt or compassionate moments (but not all of them - Tywin Lannister deserves whatever he gets!). Characters make good choices and bad; lots of bad things happen to good characters - it's really very engaging and resists dictating the readers' opinions (unless I'm being so subtley controlled I don't realize it, which is totally possible; I'm a pushover sometimes!). At this point in the story, as may be plain from the title of book 1, various figures are vying for the throne. I honestly don't know who I'm rooting for; there is definitely more than one compelling option. The only thing all readers probably agree on is who shouldn't be on the throne (Joffrey, ""the Douche."" Ok, I made that nickname up myself.)! As far as actual literary value, I have no complaints. The prose can sometimes be plodding with detailed descriptions of people's clothing (do I really care where the silk came from?) or the various courses of a feast (yum! but let's get on with it), but for the most part it is artful and eloquent. Like Stephen King, he spells out the dialectic quirks in dialogue which makes voices come alive and makes the world they're in feel more real (poor uneducated people and fancy rich people speak differently? hey, that's like real life!). He uses historical vocabulary a lot, which has made me grateful for the Kindle's built-in dictionary at times, but I think speaks to the level of research and preparation that went into it. I'm sure that if I really put my mind to it, there would be phrases or pages that I could slash with a red pen, but only very few, honestly. Even the tangential moments - during which I am anxious to get back to the action and find out what happens next in the grander scheme of things - have a purpose and feel necessary even in the moment. The story is thorough to a ridiculous degree, but this makes it feel more real; it is so holistic in its attention to detail (in both physical descriptions and emotional/psychological insight) that you can't help but believe this all happened or is happening somewhere, somewhen. Ah, verisimilitude. It's not a love story, although there is some love. It's not a true war story, despite the battle scenes - it certainly doesn't resemble All Quiet on the Western Front, A Farewell to Arms, Catch-22, or any other ""war novel"" I've ever read; it isn't really making a commentary on ""war"" as an evil thing nor is it glorified (even though heroic acts in battle certainly are). Rather the evils of war are a given, but it is accepted as a necessary process to achieve eventual stability; knights are idolized for their ability to ""protect the innocent""; their ability to decapitate with a single blow is merely the method of their brave and gentlemanly duty; of course, some relish it more than they ought to. There is no identifiable hero or villain (there are definitely a few heroes and villains though) and there is no particular ""quest"" except maybe ""achieving leadership who will protect the realm"" - but that's a pretty lame quest if you ask me. With humans fighting humans while a supernatural threat looms in the background, it could become more of an ""us against them"" in some later book, but that's not really the groundwork I think the author is laying. It feels more like just a context for a foray into the virtues and pitfalls of humanity. It should be called ""A Game of Good-Choice, Bad-Choice."" :)","2013-04-14","United States","","true","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5K3A6ZQSR5YW"
"B000FC1HBY","5","Dark and Intriguing - A Perfect Follow Up to Game of Thrones","After I finished ""Game of Thrones,"" I immediately downloaded ""Clash of Kings"" and began reading, eager to continue the story that so fully captured my attention. This series is highly addicting, and I'm incredibly late reviewing this because it's impossible to stop reading after finishing a book to compose a review. Also, the second and third book sort of run together, which makes it difficult to review them separately. This is the perfect follow up to the first book - carries the momentum from the events introduced there and sets up its own story. It somehow manages to be darker and grittier than the first installment without stepping into the realm of being gratuitous . In fact, it's probably one of the best second novels I've read. Spoilers follow. I usually give a brief summary of the novel's story in my review, but with ""Clash of Kings,"" a brief summary simply isn't possible since there's so much going on in the book and a lot of it ties deeply to the events from the first novel. Instead, I'll supply a very brief overview. With Robert Baratheon dead and the legitimacy of his children brought into question, the Iron Throne is up for grabs and Westeros is plunged into civil war as (at least) four different people claim the Throne as theirs. Meanwhile, the Night's Watch in the North begins to investigate the people beyond the Wall, the Wildlings. In the East, Daenerys Targaryen moves forward with her plan to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for herself. Her following has dwindled after the death of her husband, but her three newborn dragons make her notorious. Though she refuses to give them away to secure aid, Daenerys hopes she can use her dragons to her advantage to reclaim what, in her mind, rightfully belongs to her family. Martin sure knows how to tell a riveting story. I've read a fair bit of fantasy over the years and eventually had to take a break from the genre due to becoming bored with seeing the same clichés and tropes used over and over again. As I read ""Clash of Kings,"" I found myself waiting to see the book fall into the same pattern of predictability that I've seen elsewhere. The first book was great in being unique and unpredictable, but could Martin really maintain that high standard throughout a second book? The joke's on me because he definitely can...and I've learned better than to doubt his originality. There isn't much in the way of resolution in this book, but that's ok since there are several more books that follow it. Instead, ""Clash of Kings"" serves to propel the ideas established in the first book. We see how events from ""Game of Thrones"" have unfolded and developed into something bigger and more widespread, and what we see is fascinating. It's also worth mentioning that there are a lot of big players in this war, but Martin manages to make all of them distinct. None are just thrown in to be there and all of them are fleshed out. This isn't a generic world filled with the normal trappings of the genre - Martin's Westeros is unique and fully realized. Reading about the different factions alone would be compelling...combine it with an intriguing plot and you've got one Hell of a good read! It should also be noted that Martin pulls no punches when describing his dark, gritty world. If you're squeamish and prefer to read about characters that blush when thinking about kissing or battles that are over and done with relatively quickly and cleanly, this probably isn't your book. The big theme in ""Clash of Kings"" is the huge, ongoing civil war that has erupted across the entirety of Westeros, and no detail is spared. The full horrors of the battlefield - bones being crushed, flesh split, the gruesome results of someone being turned into a bloody pulp via being bludgeoned by a blunt object, soldiers being trampled by their own horses, pretty much any awful battle-related thing you can come up with - are portrayed in graphic detail. These fights aren't glorious; they're long, agonizing, and brutal, and Martin writes them so well that you'll find yourself on the battlefield alongside the characters (for better or worse, in some cases). He's done his research on the tools and tactics of the medieval period, and it definitely shows. He also doesn't hesitate to show us the other not-so-pleasant aspects of humanity. Sex (whether consensual or the spoils of war) is a common occurrence and it isn't portrayed in a nice, chaste manner. Like many other things in the books, it's blunt, realistic, and often uncomfortable...both for the characters and the reader. The people who populate Martin's world drink, curse, and entertain lewd, violent, or otherwise nasty thoughts. Sanitation is what you'd expect it to be in a war torn, medieval country. These things often aren't fun to read about, but they add a level of authenticity to the novel, and I personally find it refreshing to read an author who doesn't sugarcoat the realities of armed conflict. The details characterize the world and the people in it - if you read ""Clash of Kings"" and think ""Wow, this person/event/place is awful!"" then you're probably thinking what Martin intended with this characterization. Westeros is not a fun place to be, and Martin's attention to the dark, gritty, unpleasant details bring that into sharp focus. Much like with ""Game of Thrones,"" this book has several main characters with the point of view changing in each chapter. This continues to work well by providing different viewpoints of big events without becoming repetitive and tiresome. More importantly, it showcases Martin's talent for creating dynamic, three-dimensional, complex, fully realized characters. I've read a lot of novels lately that have been in first person point of view, but have ultimately failed to capture the essence of the character or put the reader in the protagonist's head. ""Clash of Kings,"" though written in third person, doesn't have this problem. Each character's viewpoint is distinctly different with the characters' biases and backgrounds moving prominently to the forefront. Even better, with the figures' biases colouring events, you'll often wonder whose version of events is the correct version or if any of them are truly accurate. It makes of an interesting, unique reading experience, especially with the big events that unfold in this book. It's also worth mentioning that although there are certain characters who are clearly protagonists and antagonists, whether or not you like them will be largely dependent on how you react to their characterization, not what their role in the story is. Since starting ""A Song of Ice and Fire,"" I've noticed that everyone seems to like and dislike different characters - and what one person may like about a certain character may cause another person to dislike them. I think this demonstrates how realistic Martin has made his characterization. It's a lot like reading about an actual person: very few people are simply classified as good or bad - instead, they have numerous aspects to their personalities that resonate well with some people and act as turn-offs to others. The characters in this book are much the same...and with many of them doing or being witness to darker, nastier things in the second novel, there are plenty of opportunities for your opinions on certain characters to change. On a random, character-related note, I'm pleased to see that Martin actually has a wide array of female characters. I'll be honest and say that the stereotypical female tropes that pop up in the fantasy genre bug the Hell out of me: women tend to be either delicate damsels or kickass warriors, neither of which has ever struck me as particularly interesting or realistic. In ""Clash of Kings,"" we're treated both to some of our favourite women from the first book as well as new heroines. There are no stereotypes here and each character embodies her own strengths and flaws. Sure, there are women who fall in line with the traditional gender roles of a medieval wife and those who prefer a more warrior-esque life (as well as many who lie somewhere in between), but they're so wonderfully characterized that they never become predictably stereotypical, nor are they overlooked in favour of the male characters. A lot of authors could learn something from Martin: it's possible to write a varied female cast without them becoming stereotypes. Furthermore, it never feels like a character is included to provide ""another female perspective"" (or another male perspective, for that matter) - they all matter and they all provide valuable insight into Westeros, the war, and their unique situations. While there isn't a ""main character"" per se, if I had to pick a point of view character that features most prominently, it would definitely be Tyrion. This is his book: how he rises to the lofty position of the King's Hand and how he uses his intellect and cunning to overcome his lack of physical prowess in a book that's largely about battles, knights, and their consequences. While Tyrion isn't my favourite character, his perspective is always interesting since he has to go about things in a vastly different way than the book's other figures. If you're a fan of Tyrion, this is your book! ""Clash of Kings"" is a solid follow up to ""Game of Thrones."" It manages to be darker and grittier than its predecessor without coming off as gratuitous and continues the story without seeming like it's being unnecessarily dragged out. Martin's writing and characters are just as satisfying as they were in the first book, and I finished the novel feeling like I needed to start the next one immediately (and I did - thank goodness I didn't have to wait!). ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" is a truly unique and refreshing entry in the fantasy genre...and it's impossible to stop reading after one (or even two) books.","2015-03-12","United States","","true","4","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYEHYJC47IZYI"
"B000FC1HBY","5","Powerful surprises and awesome characters","The bold omen of a comet ""the color of blood and flame and sunsets"" opens ""A Clash Of Kings"" the second novel in George R.R. Martin's epic fantasy series ""A Song Of Ice And Fire."" Published by Bantam Books in 1999, ""A Clash Of Kings"" is a gripping multi-layered saga filled with characters that are interesting, witty, loathsome, or sympathetic. The title of this fantasy novel is entirely accurate. Following the suspicious death of King Robert Baratheon in the first novel, his Iron Throne that unites the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros is suddenly in dispute. Although Robert has three children and his eldest son, the adolescent and wholly reprehensible Joffrey, has ascended to the throne, the regency of his mother Queen Cersei is perceived as weak. More than one claimant seeks the Iron Throne and many kings clash as peace flees the land and challengers continue to scheme and multiply. The Competing Monarchs Stannis Baratheon: A younger brother of the late King Robert, he declares himself the rightful heir of the kingdom. He dismisses the children of Robert by claiming (correctly) that they are bastards. Cersei conceived all three of the children with her twin brother Jaime Lannister with whom she has had an ongoing incestuous relationship. The allegation is so shocking however that it is not sufficient to topple the regency of Queen Cersei. Additionally, Stannis Baratheon is supported by the sorceress Melisandre who is a priestess of the Lord of Light R'hllor. She is aggressively spreading this religion in the Seven Kingdoms and her power is real. Stannis has attached himself to her power and his quest to take the throne is deadly serious. Renly Baratheon: The younger brother of Stannis Baratheon also seeks the Iron Throne. Although he has no direct claim because of numerous heirs ahead of him, Renly is attractive and well-liked, which is not the case for the dour Stannis. Renly also has many important allies and supporters that make him militarily strong. Robb Stark: The eldest son of Eddard Stark who was executed at the end of the first novel, Robb does not seek the Iron Throne. Instead, as the heir of the northern kingdom that had been united within the Seven Kingdoms, Robb has reverted to an independent state and been crowned the King of the North by his followers. He is young, only fifteen, but battles have made him grow up quickly, and with his pet dire wolf Grey Wind, he strikes a strong pose and has earned the loyalty of his men and knights. As if a kingdom splintering into civil war were not sufficient, the plot of ""A Clash Of Kings"" is even thicker than good clam chowder and many more characters and subplots are woven into the story. As in the first novel in the series, the Stark children hold a central role in the story, but now they are separated by multiple conflicts. Although the daughters Arya and Sansa take up a good portion of the novel, their brother Bran and half brother Jon Snow tend to have more interesting storylines. The crippled Bran remains in the Stark ancestral home of Winterfell. Since being pushed out a window by Jaime Lannister, Bran has begun to experience supernatural abilities now that his body is broken. He can join with his pet dire wolf during his dreams, but he is not quite sure what it all means. Then the adventures of the bastard son of Eddard Stark, Jon Snow, with the Night's Watch on the Wall take him among the wildlings of the north. During his terrifying trek, Jon faces many trials and grows increasingly appealing as a character. He also learns about the gathering threats to the Seven Kingdoms in the wild lands. The Lady Catelyn, the widow of Eddard Stark, is also an important figure in the novel. She wields a fair measure of authority as the mother of Robb, now King of the North, but her diplomatic efforts ceaselessly fail and her decisions always turn out to be bad. Tyrion The Dwarf Of all the characters devised by the imagination of Martin, Tyrion Lannister, the reviled dwarf born of his noble family, draws the reader into his life with all the power that a novel can conjure. Despite being often scorned, disliked, and dismissed, Tyrion's power has been growing. He has cultivated a dependable group of cutthroat mercenaries to his side and in this novel his powerful father has installed him as the King's Hand, an important albeit thankless administrative position with the monarchy. Redeeming qualities for Tyrion are his intelligence, sharp tongue, sarcastic aptitude, and political boldness. Along with these strong traits, he gains the devotion of the reader simply by prevailing as a small man in a big world. He always seems to slip away from death despite his lack of friends outside the influence of his ample Lannister purse. Also near the end of the novel, Tyrion joins the fighters defending King's Landing from the invasion of Stannis, and it is Tyrion's strategies that save the city from the inept and inattentive leadership of his sister and regent, Queen Cersei. ""A Clash Of Kings"" presents fantasy readers with a robust and intelligent second novel of a series that thrives with complexity and political machinations. Some readers may be intimidated by the length and detail of Martin's fantasy novels, but the reader has little need to try to keep track of everything. Martin has the ability to endow characters with a fullness of life, emotion, ambition, and everything in between that is truly a gift to literature. Readers will care about the characters. Some you will want to throttle. Others you will want to save. While still others will awe you with their majesty, like Daenerys and her three hatchling dragons leading the remnants of her followers through a hostile desert as she seeks her destiny. I graciously give Martin another five sword rating for A Clash of Kings. I wish all books could be so good.","2011-02-16","United States","","true","5","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTIXNDHUPCSN3"
"B000FC1HBY","5","The Writing is a Visionary Wonder!","The writing is a visionary Wonder! This is such an awesome read but a book you would not want to read out of order so a reader must read The Game of Thrones first or they would be completely confused of the reasoning's behind the conflicts and drama's. I have many conflicting emotions concerning this second book. Yes it is very good but aggravating because it seems the good guys have no luck and are all destroyed. The author does keep the reader hooked to every sentence in hopes that the good guys will prevail. I'm looking forward to jumping into the third book ""A Storm of Swords"". There is too much going on in this 700 plus pages to explain every detail but below I'm listing notes on some of the characters I either hate or love: Joffrey - spoiled rotten brat (13 yr old new king) that needs to be killed along with his mother Cersei and his hound Sandor Clegane - talking about a twisted individual - one sick puppy that is lethal. Cersei - another person I hate and hope she gets her head chopped off in front of her son Joffrey. Stannis Baratheon - King that needs to be slapped for getting messed up with a sorceress - get ready for all kinds of evil foul magic Renly Baratheon - shamed he got killed but in a way he was a dumb greedy bastard like most of these kings and lords. Jaime Lannister - the Kingslayer - sick and cruel individual that I hope gets killed. He is twin to Cersei and father to Joffrey (yes incest). Right now the Starks and Tullys have him captured. Tyrion Lannister - Brother to Jaime and Cersei, one of the better ones in that family but very sly. Though he is a deformed midget I like him and find him humorous at times. I like his new protector Bronn, he is lethal. I like his new men Shagga and Timett - I love their bantering and love how they think. I feel sorry for Tyrion in a way, his family is so mean to him and I hope he finds away to destroy them all and will be able to find happiness with Shae. It is funny how Tyrion has more honor and wisdom then his family, I admire him for leading his men to victory when they went to war to fight. Grand Maester Pycelle, Petyr Baelish (Littlefinger/master of coin), Janos Slynt (commander of gold cloaks),and Varys (Spider/spy-master of whisperers) - they're conniving instigators galore! CUT THROATS! Power Hungry pieces of Crap and un-trust worthy. Robb Stark - New King of the North at the age of 15 yrs old - I like their whole family except for his sister Sansa and it seems they are being killed off one by one - I hope they get a break of luck soon. Lady Catelyn - Robbs mother - one strong woman and very smart and wise. Sansa - Robb's sister - I can't stand her, she is a snooty beotch and deserves what she gets. She is so blinded by fairy tales up until this second book and now she isn't getting such a fairy tale ending since her betroth Joffrey had her fathers (Ned)head cut off and he has her beat. However now Joffrey puts her aside for another and her life outcome is in the open - will she remain a captive and be rapped or will she escape???? Arya Stark - I love this 10 yr old, she is an all out Tom Boy. When reading I look forward to her chapters and hope she comes back and kills everyone that has done her family wrong. Bran Stark - I love this kid too and think it is neat that he is a Warg - a shapeshifter in dreams, one with three eyes or a crow with 3 eyes. He can see through his DireWolf,s eyes. He and his brother Rickon (4yr old) are survivors Jon Snow - Ned Starks bastard child - I love him and his direwolf. He is a Warg also. I look forward to his adventures beyond the Black Wall and I hope he learns of the old magic and will prevail in the coming wars. The Direwolf's - love them all - Nymeria, Summer, Shaggydog, and Ghost. Though Winterfel has been burned and destroyed I hope the Starks make a comeback - they are the good guys. The kids are scattered all over, will they all come back in the end????? Daenerys Targaryen - the queen across the waters - Mother of Dragons. I think she is cool but her journey is taking too long, will she make it back over with her 3 dragons???? Will she reclaim her throne???? There is not much action happening now with her so I look forward to her drama mixed with the kings. I also hope that the Dragons will grow and reproduce. There is so much to this series and just within the two books I have read, it is so complex and mind boggling. One thing for sure and that is it keeps you on the edge of your seat, your laughing one moment and freaking out the next. The writing is a visionary wonder! Excellent read!","2013-12-09","United States","","true","6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R173PJ76C2WHM8"
"B000FC1HBY","5","Still good but could be better","I finished ""A clash of kings"" and I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. I heard some people to complain about how long and confusing those series are. I disagree- I am not native English speaker but I read first two books in English and I understood them pretty well. Those books are huge but actually the language is quite easy and this is definitely a fast to read book. The main disadvantage of ""Clash of Kings"" is probably that it is a sequel. The GOT, the first one, was a great story- if you start you will never put this book down: lots of suspicion, great characters, interesting, smart, twisted plot. What else do you need for a great fantasy book? If ""A clash of kings"" was a totally new story with new characters, it would be probably easier to build something great again. But this book is a sequel. And Martin took a great challenge. That is to make this book at least not worse than the first one, which was, as I think, one of the best fantasies stories ever written. I have to say, he managed this task pretty well. As any good sequel, you will meet some new characters. Old ones will be still the same. The style of the book pretty much follows the style of the first one which is both bad and good. Bad- because you probably expect something new and different from the sequel. Good- because Martin's writing skills are pretty darned good in this style. He still makes you get attached to those characters and make them feel sorry for them. He plays with you by putting those characters on the edge between life and death; and you just can't help yourself except for keeping reading to find out what will happen with them. While some characters will survive, others won't be so lucky.... Those series are that kind of books where people can and do die. That is probably the strongest part because in this case pretty much everything can happen. In the sequel, there is also more magic. Not fancy, Harry Potter style but dark and dangerous one. I think that made the book even better and a bit creepier. Despite the fact that the story grabs you and never let go, there are still some disadvantages. The main one is talking. Especially in the first half, the characters constantly talk, plan but never do too much stuffs. When I read first 250 pages I suddenly found out that, except for Arya, nothing too important happened yet and that made me sad. Talking, talking, not much action and that can make you bored. On the other hand, if there was no so much talking, Martin's books probably never would be so great and unique. You get attached with the characters, they do lots of stupid stuffs but you would never understand their motives without this long prologue (about the first half of the book) where everything is described without so much of action. Martin's style makes his books alive. The closer it is to the end, the more stuffs happen. The last 200 pages, I would say, perfect. I couldn't go to sleep- just kept reading. As I said, the biggest disadvantage is that it is a sequel. Look, for example, on Harry Potter books. All seven ones hold one storyline but each book is also a separate story with the beginning and the end. In ""The song of Ice and Fire"", it is one big plot divided in several books. That can be quite tricky sometimes. It is like reading half of the book, then quit and then continue reading it but only from the half of the book again. The book never seems complete. You want more but when you get it by starting reading the next one, you need some time to get used to the characters and the plot again. It is not like getting familiar with the new story like in Harry Potter- it is reading the same story from the last book. In other word, those books have neither beginning nor end and that can be quite annoying sometimes. It is the same way with Lord of the rings- one story and three books. However, nowadays you have all three books available in the store. You just read it as one story and you don't need to wait six years for a continue to come out. That is what makes the whole series a bit confusing- starting with a clash of kings and further, books never have beginning or the end. Anyways, it is still a great story. I don't regret that I started it. A Clash of Kings is a bit worse than The Game of thrones but it still holds you tight and everything you can do is to beg for more.","2011-04-30","United States","","true","7","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FTK2X6B85094"
"B000FC1HBY","4","Very entertaining, solid fourth book","I don't get why people seem to hate this book so much more than the first book or two in this series. It's more of the same; I didn't see a decrease in writing quality at all. I wish you could give half stars, because I don't quite feel this deserved 4 stars, but it's better than your average book, so I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. I'd give books 2 and 3 the same rating, and book one would have half a star more at 4. I have not yet read ADWD, but I plan on doing so soon. I do hope after such a long wait that he gives us closure on a few of the stories that happened in this book, though. The only major criticism I can make of this book is that it adds so many new variables and plot lines to the story that, while good, are distracting to the overall theme. My understanding is that the big picture story here is that the Others (or the Other, the god opposing R'hllor, or whatever prophecy you want to go by) are coming, and somehow this fractured world needs to band together to oppose that which threatens all humanity. That being said, I think we've seen enough of the fracturing -- we need to get to the banding together part already. I mean, AFFC was already supposed to be the first half of a book, and then ADWD was split again. The writing is good, the stories are good, the characters are good, but by the fourth book, I expect him to be setting up for the conclusion, and it didn't seem that way to me. The major criticism aside, this book was very entertaining. The only people who won't like it are those who need constant action scenes and battles and blood and gore to be entertained. This book is the playing of the game of thrones at its heart: - The Ironborn play their own game of thrones amongst themselves and then re-enter themselves into the bigger game of thrones for the Seven Kingdoms. -Littlefinger brings Sansa into his plots and scheming and as he gathers more power for himself, you see that he has big ambitions and is actually a strong contender in the game. - Jaime's character develops even more as he discovers his sister is not all he thought she was, and strives to keep oaths he has sworn, despite being despised by all in the realm for breaking the biggest one. - Brienne discovers that honor is not always the high road, that life is more complicated than black and white. - Cersei plots against the little queen, makes good use of her court torturer, and fails to follow the age old advice of keeping your friends close and enemies closer. - Sam's story....admittedly, is the least compelling of the bunch. It's a bit slow, but of all the stories, it's the only one that seems to be contributing to the overarching theme of prophecy and dragons and saving the world, so I'll forgive him the slower plot line there. His chapters really could've been compressed all into one, though, if they were mentioned at all. While some parts were slower than others, it was solid reading throughout and I was never bored. I do want GRRM to finish, of course, but in the meantime, it seems pointless to get angry over waiting for him to finish. I'd rather enjoy the ride. The first installment so far has been the best, but as of this book, GRRM has not slipped yet.","2025-04-13","United States","","true","8","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R246G2DL2QV307"
"B000FC1HBY","4","Overly complex, bloated and sluggish pacing, but still a good read","Ok, I just finished Book 2, and I have to say I'm not quite as happy as I was with Book 1. Don't get me wrong - it's still a very entertaining read, but I'm encountering enough things that irritate me to actually speak up a bit. (1) LEADEN PACE: Yes, I can now see what others have complained about. Book 1 moved along slowly, but Book 2 positively crawls at times. (2) EXCESSIVE LENGTH/COMPLEXITY: The author should have put this book on a treadmill, and made it loose 250 or so pages. It's too flabby, even for someone of my laid back literary nature. The chief problem is that the author tells the tale from too many different angles at the same time, and the result is a story that's fragmentary ... and difficult to get back into if you put it down for more than a few days. Working from 8 different moving points on the same map, in simultaneous fashion, is a too fragmentary, and makes it difficult for the reader to relax into the tale. Instead, the reader is left to paddle furiously, like a poodle dropped in a swimming pool, with people shouting ""over here !"" from multiple different angles. It's sink or swim. (3) EXCESSIVELY GRAPHIC VIOLENCE: I have the same complaint with movies these days ... the author seems to revel in describing sucking chest wounds, ropy intestines spilling out, and festering wounds. I'm well acquainted with the harsh realities of limited medieval medicine, but the author goes overboard at times, and there are moments when it feels like I'm watching a ""splat"" movie. Also, his ""maester"" healers seem rather under skilled, medically ... for all their supposedly great training, all the author seems capable of having them do is do simple bandages, pour boiling wine into gashes, apply leeches, and give people ""milk of poppy"" or ""dream wine"". There's a lot more to first aid, even at the medieval level, than just that. (4) EXCESSIVE SEX: I've noticed a definite trend in both TV, SciFi and Fantasy over the past 20 years towards more and more sex. There were a few scenes in Book 1 of this series that raised my eyebrow, but not enough to carp about. This book, however, raises the bar considerably ... we see fellatio & cunnilingus, as well as repeated references to anal sex, buggery, incest, rape-murders, and even a reference to necrophilia {re: the character ""Reek""}. In fact, I'd be hard pressed to name a chapter than didn't seem to have an obligatory sex scene, or sexual reference in it - and more often than not in an unsavory context. Don't get me wrong - I'm not a prude by any stretch of the imagination, and these things are realities of everyday life ... but there was no warning on the cover that the book is liberally interspersed with such content. Things have come a long way from the days of Robert E. Howard's Conan, and Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter of Mars pulps, in which we occasionally see women clad in gossamer veils, the occasional flash of nipple, and a quick fade-out on people who begin to get it on. GRRM doesn't leave the room at all ... he just lowers the action from XXX to NC-17 (single x) in order to avoid excessive complaints. In other words, he's pushing the envelope of the genre. I don't mind mature content at all ... but I *do* mind the lack of notice on the cover. The book should be marked as such, for the convenience of prospective readers who don't want to get blindsided by such things. (5) EXCESSIVE MORTALITY: Ya know, I've played in some role playing campaigns in which the mortality level was gratuitously high - to the point where it seemed like the GM was perhaps overcompensating for their own real life shortcomings (e.g., no career, no sex life, no control over their fate) by making everyone else's life a living hell. In the case of this book, the author seems (to me) to go overboard in setting up characters and sub-plots, and then killing everything (and everyone) off, just to keep people guessing. Some people call that being bold and taking risks with the plot, whereas I think of it as being excessively sadistic - what's the point of sitting though all GRRM's long and plodding buildup, only to have the author crumple it up and toss it in the trash and go off in a completely different direction ? Where's the intellectual and emotional payoff ? Although gripping and entertaining, I'd be hard pressed to find much in this book that's uplifting, comforting, secure, nostalgic or inspiring, because the author is constantly ripping down plots and characters and papering up new ones every other chapter ... like a frothing tyrant, setting up elaborate patterns of dominos, just so he can gleefully kick them over. There's a fine line between having enough mortality to make death and failure a constant presence in the overall story (as it is in real life), and having half the characters die horribly, from book to book. It's too much, IMHO. (6) ERATTA: There are some things that the author just plain gets wrong. For instance, the author's distance terminology usage appears wrong. I haven't analyzed it too closely, but it seems (to me) like he uses the term ""leagues"" as if they were the same as kilometers. They are NOT the same. One league = 3 miles = 4.83 kilometers. If his usage of the term were correct, then it should take a *lot* longer for people to get from place to place than it seems to in his plot. The author, however, doesn't seem to have the patience to support that sort of slow travel pace however, so he just seems to ignore the consequences of his improper use of terminology. (7) CULINARY SHORTCOMINGS: I enjoy writers who take their food seriously (big props to GRRM for that), but it bothers me when people make mistakes. For instance - people going on multi-week trips over rough terrain, on foot or horse, don't typically lug lots of raw eggs with them for breakfast ... they're fragile, they're heavy (mostly water), and they easily spoil. Rib bones don't have soft edible marrow ... only the bones of extremities have soft marrow that's suck able. I'd also complain about blueberries (early summer), mint (late summer & early fall), and grapes (fall) not being in season at the same time, but since the seasons in the author's world span multiples of years, I think we can let that one slide. However, if the main continent of the seven kingdoms is truly a thousand leagues long, then Dorne and The Wall should be in different hemispheres, and the growing seasons should be reversed ... however, the plot seems to imply that the entire continent is in the same hemisphere, with much the same growing season. Perhaps there's something that the author is not telling us, and that perhaps their world is 10x the diameter of Earth (and spins faster on it's axis to make up for it). Still, I find it hard to believe that they can enjoy fresh oranges way up north, at The Wall. Based on the distances involved, the author should have (instead) featured pickled lemons, instead of fresh citrus. Also, there's not enough regional variations in the cuisine depicted. We don't see much dothraki cuisine except for mares milk and horse meat, and over in the seven kingdoms, and cuisine in the north seems to differ from the south only in that the south is more wealthy, and that fruit is a bit more prevalent. The only time the author mentions spices is in spiced wine, and the only seasoning in his food is salt and pepper. For the amount of word count that the author devotes to food, he could do better, with regards to regional diversity of cuisine. Bottom line: I'm still very much enjoying this series, but there's room for improvement.","2007-08-19","United States","","true","9","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VU3H0JETHUF2"
"B000FC1HBY","4","A sequel that lives up to the original story","George R. R. Martin's A Clash of King is the second book in the Song of Ice and Fire series. I gave Game of Thrones a 5-star rating. Five stars is a hard rating to come by and a hard rating to match and while I didn't give A Clash of Kings 5-stars (I give it 4), it is only because some of the novelty of the style in which Martin tells his story is no longer new. Outside of that, A Clash of Kings was a rather breathtaking book that carries the story forward from where A Game of Thrones left off and mixes in some new viewpoint characters along the way. I counted 9 viewpoint characters throughout the novel (10 if you can't the Maester in the prologue, who we never return to). Some of these characters we are familiar with and some of the them are new. Some of the new viewpoints are familiar characters, like Theon Grayjoy, but this is the first time we see things unfolding from his eyes. Others are new to the story, like Davos. There are three things that I think Martin does masterfully in A Clash of Kings (and remember, I am a recent convert to epic fantasy, thanks to A Game of Thrones): 1. He carries the epic forward in such a way that our interest is ever increasing, but without ever revealing too much at once. 2. He build on the characters so that we become as familiar with them as our own friends and family. 3. He build the world in such a way as that we become as familiar with it as our own surroundings. One of the things that impressed me about A Game of Thrones was that the ""magic"" in the story was only hinted at. People knew that magic used to exist, but much of it had disappeared. There wasn't a good explanation for this, but that's because no one really seemed to know why. It wasn't until the very end of the novel that we started to see some hints of magic that still lingered in the world. In A Clash of Kings, we see more magic than we saw in the first book (indeed, we see some at work in the Prologue). Throughout the novel, we see more and more, just enough of it to keep us interested, but only marginally more overt than the first book. And yet, as the magic takes place, we also learn why it is growing stronger and that reasoning, so far as I can tell, falls completely in line with the story as laid out so far. But the book is about much more than magic. It's about the struggle of 5 men to become king of the realm. What I found rather remarkable about the events in A Clash of Kings is that when you get to the end of the book and see everything that has happened, it all makes perfect sense, and it all flows from what happened at the beginning of A Game of Thrones. As someone was saying on a podcast I was on the other night, you want to scream at Eddard Stark when he agrees to leave Winterfell to become the Hand of the King: ""No! Stay behind! Don't go!"" The world is a very different place than it was when things started out. Another remarkable aspect of A Clash of Kings-for me at least-is that the characters are by now so well developed that as a reader, I felt like I knew them and could guess their reactions to various events. When one of the key players in the struggle to become king was killed, my first thought was: oh man, what is Tyrion Lannister going to think about that? When Davos led the fleet into the river before King's Landing, wondering if there was some sort of trap, I wanted to scream at him. As these events unfolded, I found myself wondering what the various players would think of them, in much the same way I do when some juicy piece of gossip reaches you at work. (""Wow, I wonder what so-and-so will say when they find out that project has been killed."") It takes some measure of skill to build characters so rich and deep and distinct from one another. I wish I could do this as well in my own writing. In addition to the characters, the surrounding world has become more familiar in all of its aspects. Often times, in epic books like these (those that I have read), I easily get lost in trying to deal with all of the places and people and their spacial relations to one another. But Martin is so subtle about how he introduces places anad characters, so vivid in his description horrendous of them, that it all seems clear in my head and when we follow characters to places, be they sites of battle or big cities, I never feel lost. And there must be hundreds of minor characters, but the more prominent of them are as clear in my mind as the major players. Perhaps my favorite scene in this book was the battle scene on the river in front of King's Landing, especially when Tyrion Lannister leads a troop into battle. That scene reminded me very much of the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan. It was remarkable and during the time that I read that scene, the entire world around me fell away and I was very much there in the middle of that attack. I will be very interested to see how HBO managed to pull off that scene in Season 2 of A Game of Thrones. I also loved that we got to go beyond the Wall in this book. I'd say that there might have been some slow parts early on (the book is 1,000 pages long), but ""slow"" is a relative term and the change in pacing that I experienced might have been due to the fact that I couldn't read the book every day. I was just too busy. But a number of people have told me that the first two books are really just a build-up to the third book, A Storm of Swords. Already I can't wait to get more into that one. In the end, A Clash of Kings carried the story forward in a masterful way and has convinced me that George R. R. Martin really does know how to tell a story the right way.

"B000FC1HBY","3","In For The Long Haul","Much in the same manner as its predecessor, A Clash of Kings is an absolute monster of a book. A complete behemoth of exemplary storytelling talent that requires the upmost attention and participation from the reader, providing just as much entertainment and exposition as the reader is willing to commit. This isn't a light read for a day at the beach or a brief plane ride, prepare to sacrifice a great deal of time and effort if you're considering reading this series and getting the most out of the experience. If you weren't a fan of the amount of commitment required from the previous book, then you should have no interest in its sequel. As for the actual quality of the book itself, George R. R. Martin has proven once again that he is among the highest caliber of fantasy writers, crafting yet another epic tale with such an astonishing sense of scope and memorable characters that it's once again apparent why this series continues to galvanize both readers and television viewers alike. However, there are quite a few issues that detract from Clash of Kings' overall gravitas. It succeeds as a worthy successor to the masterful Game of Thrones, yet it doesn't quite reach the same heights as its predecessor. With a book of such an enormous magnitude, it can be quite daunting to get into, let alone write a review that successfully does it justice on all accounts. I'll start with my favorite aspect of the series: the incredible world-building. As I said, George R. R. Martin is among the absolute apex of fantasy writers. The amount of detail and mythology he interweaves into his fiction is truly stunning; made even more impressive by the amount of believability he instills within the reader as they sift through the pages. There are slight undertones of magic and mythical beasts such as dragons and white walkers, yet the more fantastical elements never overshadow the amount of believability Martin has built the series' foundations around. It's a world that feels truly alive and absolutely gargantuan in comparison to other works in the genre. With the ever-changing narrative constantly shifting between the cast of characters, the reader is continuously treated to a plethora of settings. With each new location working to further immerse the reader into the fiction, and make the world pop out of the pages. From the searing deserts of Qarth, to the frozen tundra just beyond the Great Wall; the scope is simply unmatched. The icing on the cake is the believable, and very authentic medieval dialogue that permeates the series. Each of these elements contributes significantly into making the land of Westeros one of the most well-realized and iconic fantasy realms ever conceived by one man's brilliant imagination. Say goodbye to real-life for a while. Many aspects of the previous novel carry over into Clash of Kings: political intrigue, multiple character arcs, and the series' morally ambiguous tone. However the context of the story differs substantially. Whereas Game of Thrones was akin to a political thriller, Clash of Kings plays out more along the lines of a medieval war story; complete with all the backroom deals and cloak and dagger subterfuge that has come to be expected from the genre. Fortunately Martin conveys his tale in such a brilliant manner that it avoids becoming just another generic fantasy romp. An unfortunate downside to this however is the lack of twists to spice up the narrative. Make no mistake, there are a decent amount of plot elements and sudden revelations that'll keep you engaged, yet it lacks the same degree of unforeseen plot twists that its predecessor had. The result is a highly enjoyable, albeit a much more linear story. Yet it's the memorable cast of characters that is arguably the series' strongest attribute. In my opinion, this is where I become a bit conflicted on the series and why I can't give this book a five star rating. This book is chocked full of so many characters that I cannot possibly summarize my thoughts on all of them, so I will instead give my thoughts on the most predominant ones and their lasting impact on me. The two characters which Martin wrote brilliantly were the twin mothers of the story: Cersei Lannister and Catalyn Stark. Catalyn's personal grief towards her separated family was perhaps the story's greatest emotional highpoint; whereas in contrast, Cersei Lannister is devilishly cruel and manipulative in her pursuit to secure her family the Iron Throne. Where her character truly shines is through her own reluctance of being born a woman in a predominantly patriarchal society. She's easily one of my favorite villains in recent memory. Like the majority of the characters in Clash of Kings, everyone shows human signs of triumph and defeat in their mad dash for power, or their pursuit of salvation in the eye of the storm. No character is without their flaws and nobody is walking away from this conflict without some scars. On the other end of the spectrum are the characters that unfortunately didn't click with me in one manner or another. Keep in mind that for every character I dislike, there were at least two more I loved in this book. I'm certain to garner a large amount of flak for this, but I personally don't enjoy the story arc of Jon Snow. With so many character arcs intertwined in the civil war for the Iron Throne and those simply trying to survive the chaos. It significantly hurts the pacing and overall sense of urgency of the narrative when the reader is seemingly ripped out of the moment and forced into a conflict that has seemingly no effect on the rest of the book. Jon's ordeal beyond the Great Wall feels completely isolated and irrelevant to the larger scheme of events that transpire. I'm sure he'll become more relevant in the later novels, yet as for now, I find his character underwhelming and his arc bland in comparison to the others. Contrast this with Daenerys Targaryen, another character who is largely isolated from the main events of the book. Unlike Jon Snow, Daenerys doesn't suffer from the same issues that plague Jon's chapters. Daenerys is an upcoming monarch who will undoubtedly have a massive impact on the events transpiring in the series. Like her dragons, she emits a greater presence that threatens to shake the foundations of the world. In other words, she feels integral to the story despite being isolated from the main events. Yet the character that drags the story down the most is unfortunately Bran Stark, a character that has completely overstayed his welcome. He succeeded in eliciting sympathy in the first book, yet now he's nothing more than a dead-weight that completely brings the narrative to a halt. Throughout the entire one thousand plus pages, Bran does nothing but whine about his broken legs while basking in his own dreams of transhumanism. It was saddening to see him suffer in the first book, yet he goes through little to no development in Clash of Kings, instead repeating the same morose thoughts that we've already seen far too many times in the previous book. It's hard to care really when the entire kingdom is engulfed in civil war with people dying by the hundreds. His broken legs feel insignificant in comparison. Which is why I was so surprised that Rob Stark wasn't given his own story arc. Unlike Bran, Rob has a massive impact on the story and actual development to undergo. In a book based entirely around the conflict of warring monarchs, it's truly bizarre that Martin hasn't done the character justice by providing him with his own chapters. I find the premise of his character far more compelling: a young boy forced into the horrors of war and the burden of leadership. All the wasted time moping with Bran could have been productively used on Rob instead. My final issue is one that even the first book suffered from, albeit to a much lesser extent. This series has far too many minor characters than Martin knows what to do with. Most of them end up feeling like a list of names rather than actual characters that have any real effect on the story or possess any semblance of characterization. Trying to remember every minor character in each story arc can be quite a taxing challenge for the reader, again this isn't a book for casual readers. This problem also diminishes the strong theme of family that was so endearing in the previous book. It's not completely absent, yet the companionship found within the Stark family felt like the heart of Game of Thrones. It gave the first book a great deal of character and further invested the reader in the combined fates of the characters. I'm hoping to see more interaction between the major characters in the next book. The minor characters simply don't offer much to care about. Make no mistake; Clash of Kings is a brilliant novel that die-hard fans of fantasy will devour. It isn't without its faults, being some characters feel underwhelming and the overuse of minor characters is a little trying at times. Yet the positives easily outweigh the negatives; the story and scale are both truly epic, the world feels alive and believable, and the tone is morally ambiguous and undeniably intoxicating. Here's to hoping my issues are remedied in the sequel.","2013-08-07","United States","","true","11","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DXOIAGM9SK03"
"B000FC1HBY","5","Addiction continues","I admit I am hooked now. And the world needs to wait until I finish all the books in these series. A Clash of Kings begins dramatically just as the first book did. With Robb Stark declared as the King of North, the late king Robert’s brothers, Stannis and Renly have becomes as well. With one too many contender for the Iron Throne, the plot thickens. Catelyn Stark wants to trade the Kingslayer, Jaimie Lannister for her daughters, Sansa and Arya but Robb is not too enthusiastic about it. In the King’s landing, Joffery proves himself foolish, arrogant and the worst kind of king that the realm can have. Tyrion arrives as the hand of the king and has to match wits with his cunning sister who wants to undermine him at any cost. At Winterfell, Bran Stark is having his wolf dreams at increasing frequency and unexpectedly he gets friends who believe his dreams, Jojen and Meera Reed. He also discovers that he could inhabit his wolf’s body and hunt at night – a prospect that is exciting and also equally dangerous for him. Robb sends Catelyn to parley with Stannis and Renly and to join forces with him to overthrow Joffery and avenge his father’s death. The talks fail and a shadow kills Renly – a black magic killer created by Melisandre, a priestess who accompanies Stannis. Fleeing from the murder scene, Catelyn takes away Brienne Tarth, a lady knight along with her, who swears fealty to Starks. Theon Greyjoy who was introduced in the first book has individual chapters in this one, indicating that he has a bigger role to play in the later series. Sansa Stark is stuck between hell and high water in the King’s Landing. She has no illusions about Joffery’s character now yet she is forced to act innocent and loving towards him. Surprisingly it the imp, Tyrion Lannister who is kind to her. A world apart, Danearys is in search of an army to take over the Iron Throne. She gets welcomed everywhere because of her exotic dragons but is largely unsuccessful in procuring an army. The house of undying beckons her with a promise and there she sees many visions of what the future might bring forth to her. Stannis attacks King’s Landing and is defeated thanks to Tyrion’s wildfire idea. He also arranges alliance for Joffery with Margery Tyrell, who was wedded to Renly Baratheon, thereby securing their wealth and military help. But sadly he is cast aside despite his efforts as his father takes over the role of Hand. Jon Snow in the meanwhile has marched with his band of Brothers to fight with the wildings. His progress is slow and full of surprises. The wildings are fleeing and many are rallying in the army of Mance Rayder, a self proclaimed king, who was once a brother of the night’s watch. I liked Arya’s journey in this plot. She starts out as a boy, gets captured by the Tyron Lannister’s army and brought to Hallenhell where she changes her identity to a girl. Adapting to rapidly changing circumstances, she is one smart girl. It is through her eyes, we see the devastation that the country is going through thanks to the game of thrones. She meets an intriguing assassin whose life she saves. He promises her three lives and she names of her tormenters and later realizes that she could have named Joffery or the queen as well! I loved the multi-dimensional characters that Martin builds here and he gives access to even the most vilest of characters in the book. The conversation between Jaimie Lannister’s and Catelyn Stark is most revealing and interesting, promising a deeper mystery. And Jaimie Lannister’s revelations about the mad king (whom he killed) brings forth a different angle to the story. Plus Points: Addictive, Addictive and Addictive. Please don’t read this when you are cooking. You might just burn that curry to hell! Minus Points: I was bored during the narrative of onion knight. But the author brings his perspective in to describe the war and I wonder whether he would play a bigger role in the series to come. Verdict: Get ready for a long haul. You are not going to rest until you find answers to the following - Who was Jon Snow’s mother? Why did Jaimie Lannister slay the old king? Who is the baby that Daenerys sees in her vision? Will Arya Stark ever meet her family again? Will Sansa ever get back home?","2014-02-25","United States","","true","12","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R352K39UQGF1LT"
"B000FC1HBY","5","There is a difference between bad reviews and BAD REVIEWERS","For many years, I held off starting this series because of the negative reviews and complaints. But after enough friends compared the series to The Wire in terms of scope and complexity, I realized that I had to give it a shot. Now I believe that this series represents one of the masterworks in the fantasy genre. There is nothing I can add to the positive reviews but I would like to address the negative reviews. If you look closely you will realize there are very few bad reviews, ONLY BAD REVIEWERS!!! The vast majority of negative reviews can be broken down into a few groups: BAD REVIEWERS GROUP ONE: Children (emotionally or mentally). I stopped reading fantasy books in my early twenties because they are, by and large, childish and simplistic. Some reviewers complain that they don't like the characters or can not identify with the characters Mr. Martin has created. I can only assume that these people want HEROES and VILLAINS. To those reviewers I say - stick with Disney films. The characters created by Mr. Martin are complex and ambiguous. In fact, many of the characters I hated in the first book, I found myself rooting for by the third book. BAD REVIEWERS GROUP TWO: Impatient amusement park riders. I will be the first to admit that it is hard to wait to find out what happens next. But people who want Mr Martin to ""finish the series"" seem to be operating under the faulty assumption that this series will end in some glorious conclusion that ties everything together. I have no such expectation. This is not Lord of the Rings. Good will not eternally triumph over evil and justice will not be granted for everyone. If that is what you are looking for, then you are craven and should return to your childish fairy-tales! BAD REVIEWERS GROUP THREE: The Choose your own adventurers. By books three and four you will notice more and more reviewers complaining about which characters Mr. Martin focuses on. Rarely, if ever, do they complain about the quality of the prose or the rich detail of this world Martin has created. Usually their reviews can be boiled down to - ""I want to know what happens to so and so right now!"" They also like to complain that some chapters are just filler that do not relate to the story. It seems to me that this complaint is premature until the series is complete. Minor characters in the first book are major characters in the third book and some characters disappear in the first book only to pop up again in the third. With this in mind I will assume that these filler characters or the information revealed in their chapters is relevant to later parts of the story. If you like a chef, you will be excited to eat whatever he dishes up. Not all of the meals will be to your taste but what you enjoy is the chef's creativity and boldness, not a specific flavor. This group of bad reviewers loved the first meal dished out and now they want everything to taste the same - To them I say - stick with Taco Bell! That way you always know what you are getting. BAD REVIEWERS GROUP FOUR: The Kindle reviews. Reviews regarding kindle formatting have no place amidst the book reviews. And some of these people complain that the kindle version should never cost more than the paperback version. I would argue that having all of the books in a slender little device is an added bonus that is worth something in-and-of-itself. Just imagine trying to travel with all five books! If you have the patience and maturity to go on this journey then I urge you to do so. Leave your expectations at the door and let the story unfold as it will. If you are going to read a story that is thousands of pages long, I would hope you are there for the journey, not the destination. For the rest of you, enjoy your Disney/taco bell/fairy-tales. Thank you, Mr. Martin for creating such a rich and surprising world. I am along for the ride, wherever it leads, and for however long it lasts!","2011-06-20","United States","","true","13","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S8DIH63DB7BP"

"B000FC1HBY","4","What a series!","Have you ever been weary of seeing a sequel because you know it will not be nearly as good as the original? Or have you been hesitant to see a something a second time because you just know it will not be as good as it was the first time? I have. And that is how I felt as I tried to talk myself into reading A Clash of Kings. At a time when I was struggling to find any books that I was enthusiastic about, I read the first of this 4-(so far)-part series, A Game of Thrones. I enjoyed it so thoroughly I was hesitant to read the second installment. I was skeptical. The book could not be as good, I thought. The book will tarnish the near perfect reputation of its predecessor, I told myself. That is not fair, I reasoned. And I decided that it was time to read the second book. To be fair, A Clash of Kings is not as good as A Game of Thrones. From a chronological standpoint I feel that it would essentially be impossible for the second book to be as good as or better than the first. The first was the introduction; everything was new. In the second book, though there is still more to introduce and many things are new, the story continues. And there is much more to come. I apologize if this comparison carries a negative connotation, because it is not my intent. Book two of the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, in my opinion bears a resemblance to J. R. R. Tolkien's The Two Towers (also the second book of its series). Both books have ""set-up"" roles. A lot happens without anything happening, if you follow what I am saying. The pieces are put into place in these books, and they are poised for action in the book(s) to come. That is not to say that there is any lack of action in A Clash of Kings. Far from it, rather. The story is ready to pounce. Book three, A Storm of Swords, should be a thrill ride. I am still fascinated by the chapter style. Through the entire series George R. R. Martin chooses a handful of characters and each chapter is from the perspective of one of them. Readers are able to be essentially omniscient in the realm of the Seven Kingdoms by seeing the trials and tribulations of characters good and bad, here and there. The book is a series of cliffhangers and it makes the suspense pleasurable is a strange masochistic sort of way. The tension will build and build and then just as it nears its apex, the chapter ends. The action picks up from that point...or not...a few chapters later. It sounds more frustrating than fun, but when you read the books it is actually fun and not frustrating. It also makes the books easier to get through. You will fly through a few chapters to get to the next part about whatever character you are following. I know that sci-fi/fantasy books are daunting. They seem to all be 700-1100 pages and most are but one piece of a multi-part series. It makes for a lot of reading because by taking the first you may be signing yourself up to read an entire series. I feel the same way and I just try to space the books out so it does not seem as bad. I have a decent memory and found that even though I read the first book almost eight months ago, I was able to pick up right where the story left off. I did not have to re-acclimate myself with the story. This was important because the author does not take time to recap what happened in the previous book. There is a lot of detail and it would make a long book even longer to go through it all. I do not read many books in this genre, but I truly get excited about these books. I loved A Clash of Kings and I loved A Game of Thrones before it. I look forward to continuing this series.","2006-05-04","United States","","true","15","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AEDP0HF0GXFR"
"B000FC1HBY","5","A Wonderful Continuation","Looking back, this is one of my favorite books in the series. It marks beginning of Tyrion and Cersei's back and forth struggle for influence. Tyrion is the star of this installment, in my opinion. He develops more and more as a character and the reader starts to get a clear picture of where his head is. He sees there are some underhanded things going on around him and he continually uses his cunning to set things right, or to what he believes is right. He has to be a little underhanded himself to accomplish these things at times. Arya's story also picks up tremendously. We follow her travels and the perils she faces on her way to the Wall with Yoren (who is supposed to return her to Winterfell). Characters such as Hot Pie, and Gendry are central to her story as well along with the introduction of one of my favorites, Jaqen H'Ghar. Chance meetings with Amory Lorch and Gregor Clegane's forces make for an exciting read. We see Robb's further rise to power through the eyes of Catelyn Stark. She does her best to provide counsel, but the more Robb settles into his role as the king, the less he heeds it. We also learn more of Renly and Stannis Baratheon's new quest for the throne. We're introduced to Davos Seaworth who tells the story of Stannis Baratheon's bid for the throne through his eyes. He is suspicious of Stannis' new found religion, worshiping R'hollor, The Lord of Light. A red priestess, named Melisandre is introduced as a pivotal character in this story. Possibly the most important development in this installment is the story of Theon Greyjoy. He returns to Pyke and means to claim his rights as his heir to his father Balon. We're also introduced (in a hilarious way) to Asha Greyjoy, Theon's sister. Other new Greyjoy's emerge in his uncles Aeron ""The Damphair"" Grejoy and Victarion Greyjoy. He isn't received as warmly as he would have liked and gradually, becomes more desperate to make a name for himself. A wonderful depiction of what lust for power and riches can do to a man's soul. We also have Bran in Winterfell fulfulling his role as acting Lord of Winterfell. With a little help from Rodrick Cassel and Maester Luwin, he entertains guests who will later play an important role in the saga such as Wyman Manderly, and Jojen and Meera Reed. Bran faces some of the most heartbreaking challenges of anyone in the book. Sansa's story continues as she struggles with the death of her father and living under the same roof and her betrothal to the boy that ordered Eddard's demise. She endures much and remains wary of Cersei's ostensible comfort and grooming to become a queen. Of course, the story of Jon on the wall continues as they venture beyond the wall in search of answers and hopefully, Benjen Stark's whereabouts or demise. He travels with Qhorin Halfhand and faces a monumental decision that questions his very vows to The Night Watch. Also Daenerys' story continues as she tries to move forward after the death of Khal Drogo and gather power behind her dragons. We're introduced to Quaithe, Pyat Pree, and Xharo Xhoan Daxos, representatives of Quarth. Each with their own counsel for Daenerys to gather more power along the way. It's an amazing read just as the first and the three after it are. This series will certainly go down in history as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, fantasy stories of all time.","2011-09-29","United States","","true","16","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QH4UQ8PHQNFQ"
"B000FC1HBY","4","Stirs a Passion within the soul","Martin pens a worthy follow up to his fantasy epic, ""A Game of Thrones,"" with ""A Clash of Kings."" Mainly set on the land of Westros, several men fight for the crown of the seven kingdoms. Will there be a winner? In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the mother of dragons, seeks to find a way to return to Westros. The story opens with the main characters observing a comet in the sky. Each has their own personal interpretations of the comet - good and bad. What I liked about Martin's use of the comet was how he evoked ""an impending sense"" about what was going to occur and what was inevitable. This tone lingers in the reader's mind as the story enfolds. Stannis, the previous king's rightful heir, has turned to sorcery and believes the time is right to attack Westros and secure his throne. With his backers and sorceress, he sets out to accomplish his inevitable mission. In King's Landing, the 13-year-old king, Joffery, demonstrates cruel brutality and little concern for the subjects who follow him. It's up to his uncle, Tyrion Lannister, to defend the city and carry out justice. Tyrion has quite a challenge considering the obstacles in his path. Tyrion's father, Tywin, fights north of King's Landing, but is unable to defeat Robb Stark's forces or secure his son, Jaime's, freedom. Ayra Stark finds herself at Harrenhal, serving first the Lannisters, than Robb's man, Bolton, and she must rely on all her wits to stay alive. Will Syrio's lessons prove enough? To the west, Balon Greyjoy, self-styled king of the iron islands, attacks the northern coast. His son, Theon, returns to a prodigal greetings and finds his sister holds much favor with their father. Wanting to earn prestige in his father's eyes, he attacks the Starks at Winterfell. Bran and Rickon flee Winterfell and are presumed dead. North of Winterfell, Jon Snow and the Night's Watch explore beyond the wall in order to determine the nature of the impeding threat. Catelyn Stark journeys to Storm's End and has an adventure before returning to Riverrun where she is determined to support her son, Robb. An explosive confrontation with Jaime Lannister towards the end of the story settles several issues for her. In the south, Renly Barathron makes plans to attack King's Landing, but first he must deal with his brother, Stannis. In the far the far east, Daenerys leads her Khalhaser through barren land before finding hope in the city of Quarth. Martin's story is told from several perspectives, giving the novel its epic fantasy feel. The writing is sharp and never lingers, moving from event to event at a crisp pace. Martin's characters give the story its heart. For Daenerys, her character continues to grow in inner strength and resolve. Theon's deception is heartbreaking, while Tyrion's honest approach as the King's Hand had me rooting for him despite the darkness behind the Lannister's bright colors. ""A Clash of Kings"" stirs a passion within the soul, making the reader feel as if they're a knight in Westros. The only drawback, while minor for me, were the open plot points at the end of the novel. While several ends were tied up, new ones developed. There's no feeling of satisfaction at the end just a restless anxiety that promises to continue with ""A Storm of Swords."" Martin, though, has me hooked, so I'll read to find out what happens next. Some, however, may find the unresolved ending frustrating. Who will be the king of the 7 kingdoms? Joffery? Renly? Stannis? Balon Greyjoy? Robb Stark? ""A Clash of Kings"" promises surprises, fast-paced action, and will leave the reader anxious to read the next book in the series. Overall, ""A Clash of Kings"" will leave you breathless and wanting to know what happens next.","2012-01-04","United States","","true","17","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CEMO2PXO8Y9C"
"B000FC1HBY","4","An engaging tale by a master storyteller...","I was originally drawn to this series by some comments I read that favorably compared its author to JRR Tolkien--a parallel that Mr. Martin clearly encourages with his own prominent supernumeRaRy middle initials. While I find his Song of Ice and Fire similarly engaging and voluminous thus far, it's no Lord of the Rings. Yet why should it be? As a linguist and a scholar, JRRT spent years independently developing the languages, mythology, and political history of Middle Earth before turning Frodo loose within that world. In terms of depth and immersiveness, LotR derives incalculable benefit from the uniquely backward mode of its conception. It does not surprise me that other fantasy novels' settings often appear thin-fleshed and contrived by comparison (Frank Herbert's Dune being a rare exception). While aSoIaF does exhibit some minor shortcomings in this regard, I think this sort of evaluation is ultimately unfruitful and misleading: Martin's strengths lie elsewhere. His aSoIaF reads as more medieval soap opera than epic literature, its vivid and immediate characterizations revealing the unspoken thoughts and emotions of the many protagonists. Although the supernatural exists, good and evil here are not personified as absolutes (cf. Sauron) but instead are manifest in human interaction, and their interpretation often depends on perspective. Events are told from the characters' point of view and are unavoidably filtered and colored by their egos. It is their hopes and fears, their stratagems and machinations, their interpersonal and physical conflicts that matter most in Martin's world. I wound up caring sincerely about Jon, Arya, Bran, and Tyrion--a dangerous undertaking, given Martin's unflinching (and admirable) refusal to shield his heroes from the Machiavellian, often lethal cruelty of their environment. Several reviewers have decried or defended the graphic language that pervades these books. Martin deliberately aims for a certain coarseness, preferring blunt Anglo-Saxon words to flowery Latin cognates. This is intended to set a gritty, unsparing, medieval tone for the story, and apart from a few jarringly anachronistic turns of phrase (""butt cheeks"", e.g.), it works well and is even refreshing, given the suffocating mawkishness of some other novels in the genre. Still, I must say I often found the continual parade of bodily functions, ""whores"" (willing and otherwise), and ""Penthouse Forum""-style sexual conquests gratuitous and distracting, even juvenile at spots. Does the author's quest for ultimate realism require that his readers be privy to every bathroom break in the woods? At such times I felt grateful to Tolkien for all that he left implied or unsaid in LotR. I don't mind graphic sexual imagery used in moderation to serve plot or characterization, but reading Martin sometimes feels like eating an entire bottle of ketchup with a single hot dog (somewhat ironically, the Amazon review editors nixed the Tabasco metaphor I had originally used here). Sometimes, less is more. As with the frequent long ""roster for today's tourney"" lists of names and house sigils, such bits are easily skipped over without detriment, but it would be perilous to conclude that Martin is inflexibly prolix and incapable of subtlety: Some of the most wrenching plot revelations--I'm thinking of one in particular involving Bran--are first conveyed within the space of a few disarmingly parenthetical remarks! So, you must also keep your eyes peeled, or be prepared to backtrack if you're skimming. Notwithstanding my various criticisms, I have thoroughly enjoyed this series and consider it well worth the effort to read, even if the pace does flag somewhat in the 2nd book. I'm eager to read ""A Storm of Swords"" as well as the 4th book, after which I suppose I'll join the frustrated souls who impatiently await the concluding installments, wondering how (and if) Martin plans to wrap it all up. I give the series to this point a solid ""B"", or 4 stars, with Book 1 earning a B-plus and Book 2 a B-minus.","2002-12-11","United States","","true","18","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33JA57WQOFMI9"

"B000FC1HBY","5","hardcore fantasy!","During one of those endless nights when I just couldn't put Clash of Kings down, I wondered: ""Why aren't there more books like this?"" George Martin has created one of those most deeply involving and satisfying series out there. In only two books, he has crafted real characters involved in the horrors of war. Many of the reviews below accurately describe the way that Martin creates characters of grey, rather than comic book black and whites. Many of the scenes in the book fit well with dark and somber lighting. This is not your daddy's fantasy novel. Martin's characters bring a more realistic spin on knighthood and war. Cersei describes it best to young Sansa when she destroys the young girl's romantic view of knights by remarking that knights are for killing, nothing more or less. And kill they do. The battle scenes are raw and unglamorous, like the opening scene from Saving Private Ryan. Its all very realistic and gritty and heck, it makes sense: what do you really think happens when a not-so-sharp sword is swung haphazardly at another person: I've never seen it firsthand, but I'm sure its not pretty. It may be an oxymoron to claim that a fantasy book can be realistic, but this series is: after seeing the battle scenes in Braveheart or Gladiator, I have a deeper understanding of the horrors of sword fighting in, say, the medieval times in English history. Martin's story is realistic in the sense that it doesn't gloss over the horror and pain and terror of battles and the rage of the people who fight them. Martin's series is a hardcore fantasy adventure for adults. While other authors cater predominately to a younger fantasy audience, Martin seems to write for the ""college and beyond"" crowd (at 50, I'm well beyond). Sex scenes, like the battles, are not glamorous in the least. Whereas characters in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series constantly blush and stumble at the very thought of even kissing a girl, Martin's characters think lewd thoughts, perform graphic sex scenes, etc. Yes, its not for all ages, or for every taste, but for those of us who are tired of the same old antiseptic stuff, Martin is a mature breathe of fresh air. Meanwhile, he continues to awe me with his story telling. The different kings are now in open conflict with each other. Whereas Game of Thrones focused on the Starks v. the Lannisters, in this installment, it seems as if the entire land is in termoil, with no less than six kings fighting each other and attacking each other. The battles are terrific, including the climactic battle. (no spoilers here) One other note I feel compelled to make is that Martin has created strong and independant female characters in his series. People might assume, based on the reviews, that this is a male-dominated story. Nothing could be further from the truth. Martin spends as much time writing about the female characters (Sansa, Arya, Catelyn Stark) as the male characters, and the female characters rule (i.e. Cersei) and fight battles (I won't reveal any specifics on this point except to say that Martin introduces two female warriors.) Martin has created a real world, with all the vices of our own, and given all his characters life. Here's hoping that other writers take note.","2013-03-21","United States","","true","20","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVKARTPDI5KKO"
"B000FC1HBY","5","A Song of Ice and Fire Takes a Dark Turn....","I thought ""A Game of Thrones"" was rather morbid, gritty, and heart-wrenching. Well, surprisingly, A Clash of Kings surpasses all of what GOT was by far. While GOT is definitely not what I'd call a constantly up-lifting tale, the thoughts of the days where Ned was the Hand of the King, Sansa a gullible, starry-eyed young girl in love with Joffrey, and Arya taking lessons with Syrio were always something to smile about, even when things started taking a dark turn. However, this novel managed to shatter all of that entirely into pieces. There are no safe places, no safe characters, and the brutality of it all goes way beyond anything we read in GOT. This is all-out war, in it's most sickly and realistic form. Treacheries of the worst sort, fratricide, continued incest, rapes, torture, and all of the bloody and horrific parts of war....this isn't a fairy tale or for the faint of heart! Obviously, with an incredible amount of people calling themselves king and even more scheming to become king, there is going to be war. At times the book is a little slow moving, but at around 70% through (Kindle version), the action elevated quickly. Some of the things in this book will just make your jaw drop, and for me, the absolute disgustingness of one particular character was bone-chilling. Fantasy plays a much bigger role in this book than a GOT. While we were only given small glimpses of fantasy in the first book, A Clash of Kings has its fair share of warlocks, pyromancers, supernatural things (sort-of) beyond The Wall, and dark magic. I think fantasy will play a much larger part in future books, and I like how Martin eases us into it. I'd write more on that, but don't want to spoil it. HBO I cannot wait to see what HBO does with this book. I would have to guess it was even more expensive than the first to produce, with constant war scenes. Hopefully, they won't scale the world of Westeros down as much as they did in the first season, where everything seemed to be on a smaller-sized scale. The vastness of Westeros in a really key part of the series, and I want the show to reflect this. It will also be interesting to see how bloody and sexual things will get. While I doubt they'll tone down the sex and nudity much, some of the violence was just horrific (that kindly Ser Gregor...). I hope they show it all though, and stay true to the book, which I feel confident they will. If you enjoy books that have more ""grey"" characters rather than one-dimensional black and white ones, have a strong stomach, and love amazing, captivating writing that will keep you entranced, you will love this series. Some people complain that it's too much of a ""downer,"" well - if you're concerned about that, you may want to check into reading a more archetypal ""good vs. evil guys"" fantasy book than this one. Regardless, this book isn't a total downer. It's just real. There are plenty of good things you can take from this book. It's all about how you interpret it.","2012-01-18","United States","","true","21","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NVV95GAKQWHR"
"B000FC1HBY","4","The Rise of Unlikely Heroes","I dove into the second book in George R.R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series with reckless abandon. After having devoured A Game of Thrones like a greedy little pig, I couldn't wait to read A Clash of Kings to find out how my favorite characters fared as the series continued. Needless to say, the first chapter of A Clash of Kings got off to a slow start, introducing us to a new character who didn't have as much to do with the rest of the book as I'd hoped. I found myself reading through that chapter quickly in hopes of rejoining survivors from book one, and though that first chapter felt as though it dragged just a bit, I wasn't disappointed as I continued on. Soon I was reunited with Tyrion Lannister, the Stark children and their mother Catelyn each scattered across the miles of Westeros and Daenerys Targaryen. Just as the title suggests, this second book focused heavily on the many kings battling one another for dominance, but never do we directly see the world from the direct perspective of the actual kings. We come to King Joffrey through Sansa Stark and Tyrion Lannister. Northern King Robb Stark is seen through his mother Catelyn's eyes. Davos the Onion Knight views the rise of Stannis Baratheon. While it may seem as though this secondhand view takes you away from some of the greatest action of the book, it actually gives you a firsthand, behind-the-scenes experience through those who deal directly the royal realms. I began the series suspicious and wary of Tyrion Lannister, but by the end of A Game of Thrones he had quickly become one of my favorite characters. Martin continued to develop Tyrion in such a way that despite his seedy antics and twisted mind, he is perhaps one of the most sympathetic characters in the series thus far. He also gave us a greater peek at Jaime Lannister, The Kingslayer, through the eyes of Catelyn Stark, that was well worth the wait. Theon Greyjoy's part in A Clash of Kings was unexpected, but well-metered, skillfully portraying the folly of youth tempered with uncertain ambition. I think one of my favorite parts of the book was how many unlikely heroes arose from the darkness. Men you expected to be tainted to the bone with nothing but horror and wickedness turned out to be incredibly human, making that part of me that wanted to hate them until the bloody end soften with sympathy. I have also loved watching both Arya and Sansa Stark continue to find their strengths despite the hideous odds they're both up against. I enjoyed A Clash of Kings a great deal, but I have to admit that after the powerful impact of A Game of Thrones had on me as a first time reader, the sequel left me wanting. I hoped for more development in areas that just didn't develop and I can only pray the third book fills those aching gaps. Overall, I give the book 4 out of 5 stars, and highly recommend it to medieval fantasy lovers. A Song of Ice and Fire has been one of the best fantasy series I've read in years. Martin's grasp on courtly politics, as well as the steady, continuous build of his mythology has me anxious to get started on the third book in the series, A Storm of Swords.","2011-04-12","United States","","true","22","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFT9B4LN4WGQZ"
"B000FC1HBY","4","The magic is slow to build","""A Clash of Kings"" got me through two long airplane trips in steerage class, plus several sleepless nights when I was trapped in a noisy Roman hotel with sixty Episcopalian choir boys. For that I am grateful. I won't admit to being addicted to Martin's epic medieval war fantasy, but I've already started Volume III,""A Storm of Swords,"" from his projected six-volume series, ""A Song of Ice and Fire."" After finishing ""A Game of Thrones (Volume I),"" I wasn't sure how the author was going to extend his story to six, thousand-page volumes. However ""A Clash of Kings"" opens up many possible plot lines---there are five kings in Volume II as opposed to one king in Volume I, and they spend this book warring against each other. If you like to read about trebuchets that ""turned living men into bone and pulp and gristle,"" and you know the difference between a mace and a morning-star, then you'll probably enjoy the battle scenes more than I did. Martin did his research on medieval weaponry and tactics, and his action scenes are totally riveting, even though ripped entrails, ichorous fluids, spastic colons, and roasting flesh are prominently featured. I guess you can't scramble for thrones without breaking a few yokels. Martin splits his narrative between ten different characters, eight of them continuing their stories from volume I: · The Starks of Winterfell--- Lord Eddard of Winterfell's widow Catelyn, her daughters Sansa and Arya, her son Bran, plus Eddard's son, Jon. Catelyn's son Robb is crowned King of the North and spends much of volume II defeating the various armies fielded by Joffrey Baratheon's royal relatives. · Daenerys Targaryen, daughter of the last Dragon-blood king and referred to as the 'Queen across the Water.' She spends volume II raising her three young dragons and outwitting the various and colorful folks who covet a flying lizard of their very own. · Tyrion Lannister, the current Queen's dwarf brother and chief councilor to the under-age king, Joffrey Baratheon. Tyrion schemes with eunuchs, punishes traitors,defends his king, and dodges his sister-Queen's murderous henchmen. He has all of the best lines in the book and I love him dearly even if he does lose part of his nose. · Theon Grayjoy (new) - once a ward of the Starks, now a scheming turncoat. · Davos the Onion Knight (new) - a former smuggler who is loyal to the 'King in the Narrow Sea,' Stannis Baratheon. Davos and Tyrion Lannister are burdened with the main battle narratives, Davos from the sea and Tyrion from the besieged city. Please don't try to read ""A Clash of Kings"" unless you've already finished ""A Game of Thrones."" You might be able to skip ""A Clash of Kings"" and go straight to volume III, although I wouldn't recommend doing so. Although there is plenty of action, not much happens to move the whole series forward in volume II. One of the five kings hooks up with a powerful fire sorceress, and in my humble opinion that is 'the' most important happening in ""Clash"". However, we start to catch glimpses of the supernatural bones that support Martin's epic, e.g. the servants of the Drowned God, the followers of the Lord of Light, and evil sorcery beyond the Wall of ice. Martin is moving as slowly as the glacier beyond the Wall, but the first three volumes of ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" are compulsive reading.","2001-07-16","United States","","true","23","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R233NATH22OX6I"
"B000FC1HBY","5","What a ride!","I watched the HBO series years ago and enjoyed it very much, but I had not read the books until now. When I read Game of Thrones, it seemed so much like the TV series that I was a little disappointed. With Clash of Kings, there was enough difference, and distance in time, that my memory didn't negatively impact the story. I enjoyed this book tremendously, but I don't understand the extreme explanations of food throughout the story. Don't get me wrong - I love food as much as the next person - but I'm not sure I needed all of the mind-numbing descriptions of what was laid out on the table. Or maybe I did and I just didn't realize it! Either way, the hallmark of GRRM is the multiple POVs, the political intrigue and the maneuvering, all of the characters - some you like and some you despise - and, most of all, how the story is told - it's a slow burn that is turned up five notches by the action. Tyrion Lannister was one of my favorite characters from the TV series, but these first two books have increased my esteem of him even more. The books, especially Clash of Kings, has taken us into his thought processes - why did he make this decision instead of that one - and has given us insight into where he comes from and what has formed him into the 'half-man' that he is! If you've never read the books, you need to read them. If you've seen the TV series, you should read the books. If you enjoy twists, turns, unexpected deaths, and surprise appearances, you need to read these books. Keep in mind, at least this was true for me, that GRRM books are not one day (or even one week) reads. You have to spend some time with the book. You have to delve into the characters. I have spent three months with the first two books and will likely spend at least that with the next two. Be prepared to be swept into Westeros, but don't expect to leave quickly!","2023-04-19","United States","","true","24","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NH5FJYR8NKNK"
"B000FC1HBY","5","Epic fantasy as compelling as it is complex","As enthralled as I was by A Game of Thrones, the first book in this series, I really expected to take a break and read in some other genre after I finished that book. Oh, I tried; but it was not to be. About 100 pages into the history I chose I found myself wanting to know more about the epic struggle in Westeros and how the events in the first book were casting ripples from Westeros, across the Narrow Sea and to the lands beyond. I'm convinced George R.R. Martin is producing literary crack with his stories of the battles and the intrigues of this fictional land. I almost referred to Westeros as a ""mythical"" land, but that would have fallen short as a description. Mythic has always seemed to refer to larger-than-life characters. In A Clash of Kings the characters are life-sized and very human. They are also very complicated, neither entirely good nor entirely evil. Even when they may do evil things, their motivations seem truly human and understandable. There are no ""classic"" bad guys who chortle with glee when their nefarious plans come to fruition. I even found myself empathizing with Cersei and her son, King Joffery, who are arguably the least likable characters. Not only does Martin produce fascinating characters, but the world of Westeros is masterfully built. Rather than throw tons of exposition at readers all at once, Martin lets the kingdoms blossom slowly and we are constantly making new discoveries. Take, for example, his decriptions of the religions of Westeros. In A Game of Thrones he offers some details of the new gods and the old gods. In A Clash of Kings he adds new details that enhance what has come before. The technique adds layers of depth to the story. Likewise, the world Martin created is a morally neutral one. Evil sometimes triumphs. Good sometimes get corrupted. Even the most noble characters can die (as we learned in the first book). Martin isn't afraid to turn the conventional wisdom of fantasy on its head (or even shake them up, toss them in a literary food processor, and serve up the results to readers). As a result - at least in the first two works - you get a series weaving traditional fantasy threads through a world that feels very natural and organic. I've purposely avoided discussing the plot of A Clash of Kings. That's partly because any synopsis I could write would pale in comparison to Martin's complicated, yet readable, plotting. That he can keeps us reading while his plot runs from battlefields to bedchambers to the froze land beyond The Wall to the Red Waste across the Narrow Sea is nothing short of amazing. Couple that with some of the most fascinating characters I've ever encountered between the covers of a book and you have an absolute winner. Tyrion, Jon Stark, Arya, Caitlyn ... I'd almost swear these were flesh-and-blood people who allowed me to look over their shoulders. It's nearly impossible to heap enough praise on Martin's series, but allow me one more observation: rather than taking a break after completing A Clash of Kings, I've already downloaded the next in the series, A Storm of Swords, and will eagerly dive into it tonight.","2012-04-04","United States","","true","25","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VVEGGA5G4AU3"
"B000FC1HBY","4","Wickedly Entertaining","This is the second book in the wickedly-entertaining ""A Song of Fire and Ice"" series from George R. R. Martin. The story picks up from where ""A Game of Thrones"" left off. Chaos and violence reign following the deaths of King Robert Baratheon and his ""Hand"", Lord Eddard Stark. The land of Westeros is torn apart. Four men are fighting for control of the Iron Throne. King Rob Stark is after the men responsible for the murder of his father, Lord Eddard Stark. The Queen's illegitimate son, a cruel boy of thirteen, now sits on the Iron Throne. And the former king's two brothers, Renly Baratheon and Stannis Baratheon both want the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, across the sea, Princess Daenerys Stormborn, the last of the great Targaryen family, have just managed to bring three fossilized dragon eggs back to life. Against this backdrop of large-scale battles, the main players introduced in the previous book continue to live out their lives and to try to find their place in this tumultuous period in the history of Westeros. We find the bastard, Jon Snow, slowly moving up among the Night Watch hierarchy. Assigned as a squire to the Lord Commander of the Night Watch, Jon goes off beyond the Wall to face and fight the dangerous Wildlings. His ever-present direwolf, Ghost, and his trusty sidekick, the craven Samwell Tarly are both with him. The overly-ambitious Theon Greyjoy has put together a plan that could make him another contender for the kingship of Westeros. Meanwhile, the Westerosi Houses, both great and small, continue to tirelessly plot and scheme in order to place themselves closer to the center of power. But enough of the story. I, Citan, your humble friend and reviewer, would not want to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that this second book in the series is even better than the first one. The pace is faster, and there are less ""fillings"", so to speak. Every chapter, once again, is a POV from a specific character's perspective. Sort of like playing a First-Person-Shooter video game. You never get the complete picture, because you don't have a third-person narrator. What you get is the character's POV. You ""see"" only what the character sees. But Martin does a good job of putting together the POVs so that, after reading a few, you get a more complete picture of events. This is not a novel for the casual reader who likes to skip chapters and speed-read pages. Indeed, you will have to pay attention and put the POVs (points-of-view) together to understand the story and decipher the plot. Let me say once again that this is a fantasy series for mature audiences. Incest, betrayal, sorcery, and violence are ever-present within the pages of the novel. However, those same qualities probably give the series more realism than your typical fantasy fare. I highly recommend the series to anyone who likes fantasy.","2008-02-26","United States","","true","26","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAR9F4FCF8WZS"
"B000FC1HBY","4","Good, but not a Tolkein.. Maybe with better editing.","This is a good continuation to the first book of the series. This book ends very much leaving the reader thinking, ""That's it?!"" I wish the ends were a bit more tied up by the conclusion of this book. It very much looks like someone took a giant book, and just separated it between chapters and called them separate books. I also feel, much like in the first book, someone badly needed to edit this book. The author did a great job, but the editor seemed to be asleep, if one was used. Pronouns were WAY too heavily used. As an example from the book: ""He saw Ulf go down with a crossbow bolt through the belly as he ran for the Great Hall. Maester Luwin was trying to reach him when a knight on a warhorse planted a spear between his shoulders, then swung back to ride over him. Another man whipped a torch round and round his head and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables."" Martin, George R.R. (2003-01-01). A Clash of Kings: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two (p. 700). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. From the above, I can tell you that the first instance of ""He"" refers to a guy named Theon. It seems Ulf got shot with a crossbow. But which ""he"" ran for the great hall; Theon or Ulf? I presume Ulf was running, but... can't be sure. Then we throw in Maester Luwin, who was trying to reach ""him."" Was he trying to reach Theon or Ulf? I suspect Ulf, but... again, it isn't crystal clear. Now, who on earth got a spear between the shoulders? I haven't got any idea. Even after completing the book, I don't know. I know all three men end of dead as a result of that encounter, but I can't be perfectly sure which one got the spear in the shoulders. It's not as though it is crucially important to the story as a whole, but... If it's worth having in the story, shouldn't it be made clear? And that's just one instance I thought of, off the top of my head. The book is full of these kinds of things. Another complaint I have is the almost predictable redundancy; the over use of the same description for something. Yeah, I know that's vague. So, here's an example. Everywhere, someone is ""breaking his fast"" or ""breaking her fast"" or ""broke his fast"" or ""broke their fast"" or some other variation of a fast being broken. Never ""for his morning meal"" or ""she began her day eating"" or ""his first order of business after dressing was to eat..."" Nope, anytime someone ate after they slept, it is referred to as a breaking of a fast. Exclusively. Same thing with everyone wearing ""boiled leather."" Boiled leather everywhere. Can't we just call it leather SOMETIMES? Very very redundant in some instances like that. Still. it's a book very much worth the read.","2013-09-28","United States","","true","27","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1K3FKXLDKBM4P"
"B000FC1HBY","4","Could Have Been Better","This review will have spoilers so I'm stating that at the start. It could have been a 5 star except halfway through I see why so many have complained about Robb not being a PoV character like every other member of his family is except baby brother Rickon. In AGoT, it wasn't as clear since Catelyn was at Robb's side for most of what Robb did. So the readers got things Robb did from his mother's PoV. However, in this book she gets sent away to speak with Renly. Then suddenly in a Sansa chapter we get hit with Robb winning a battle. I was as wondering as Sansa was why Joffrey was so angry and like Sansa I first thought he discovered her plan of escape. All I can say is HBO will be screwed in season 2 unless they make the creative change of making Robb a PoV character and show what he does. About that point I started to not care about the book and skipping chapters. Theon? REALLY? Robb doesn't get promoted to a PoV but Theon does? I read the first couple of his chapters then discovered I was bored with him. So bored that I saved the next one with him for later when I had a case of insomnia for a few nights. Then that Theon chapter solved the insomnia as I was asleep in no time. Now going back a step, I have a major issue with Arya. Everything in the book makes it seems as if almost a year had pass since Eddard was killed. Statements like ""it's been 10 months"" and other things like characters all a year older. However, she hasn't even gotten close to Winterfell. It takes months to travel from Kings Landing to Winterfell? Yet someone made it to Kings Landing from the Wall in less time as one of the Tyrion chapters showed. There's plotholes that have to be ignored in this book. It's a good book but not as good as the first in my opinion. HBO which is what introduced me to this series better make changes or season 2 might be their ""jumping the shark"" moment. While it's a good book, translation to the screen will be lacking because viewers will just get a lot of talking and not much action except from Arya and Jon. And just hear about most of the real action which we would have gotten if the readers were given Robb. Edit: Yesterday I found a site that showed the new faces for season 2. And it shows how HBO sees Robb being so little used as in the readers seeing his part of the story that HBO is bringing in a character we shouldn't be seeing yet. That character is heavily involved in Robb's story but not in this book. As a matter of fact this particular character isn't even in this book at all. Plus some names not in the book but are guessed to be same characters with different names (a Lannister cousin and another character's sibling). So apparently, HBO is making more changes next season.","2011-09-29","United States","","true","28","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19CJ7ZB4F0CXR"
"B000FC1HBY","4","**** ½","Everything that I wrote about ""The Game of Thrones"" is true for this continuing storyline as well. I will include the same review as for the first novel. I have read plenty of average fantasy in my life, so I wasn't looking forward to diving into any more eight hundred page novels that might be of a similar caliber. Strike two is that I don't generally love much of anything that's set in a medieval time period... so my expectations were low until I started reading reviews everywhere. Still hesitant at that point, I purchased this novel and was blown away. Martin is unbelievable in that he is willing to do so many things with his characters that you wouldn't expect (or want him to do), but in the long run, making big moves like these are what really create the epic moments that you won't forget anytime soon. The other major plus is that he the best in the genre at creating so many moments of tension. You just can't wait to find out where this next plot twist is going to take you... and then he moves you on to another protagonist's/antagonist's point of view. Once this story gets moving, I was constantly on the edge of losing my mind! It's nearly impossible not to skip ahead in the book to the next portion of that character's story. Overall, Martin has created a remarkably engrossing storyline with a broad cast of well-developed characters that would rival almost any work of fiction that I've read. He does pretty much everything right in this novel, however, the only reasons I don't give it a five star rating are: 1. My lack of enthusiasm of this time period in general; he does it very well, but it's still not my favorite thus bringing my enjoyment level down a notch or two 2. I didn't really learn anything from the novel. It's very fun to read, but one of the things about reading fiction, nonfiction, etc is that I love to learn from the writer. Many of my favorite authors of fiction know how to weave lots of incredible depth and emotional development into their characters that we can apply to our situations (or to other people that we've interacted with). Don't get me wrong, this is incredible writing, and I am highly recommending it to anyone that loves to read.... and if you've never read fantasy before, focus your energy here. *****___(Perfection) The highest degree of enjoyment / fulfillment I've personally experienced with reading ****½___(Excellent) Only lower than five stars due to falling short on any number of ""subjective"" categories ****____(Influential) A very satisfying experience and has me looking for more from this writer/genre ***½____(Good) Keeps me engaged but unlikely to look for more by this writer unless highly recommended ***_____(Average) Could take it or leave it and will not be looking for more by the same writer **______(Poor) Constantly asking myself, ""How much worse can this get?"" every few minutes *_______(Terrible) Belongs in the dumpster...

"B000FC1HBY","4","The series is getting better....","The second part of A Song of Ice and Fire is a little better than the first book, but it follows in the same vein. Martin loves describing anything to great lengths, except battles. He can take half a paragraph describing the food on the table, and he goes at great lengths to describe a characters thoughts/feelings over a characters action. So, what we get is strong storytelling, everything isn't black or white, everybody for the most part has shades of grey, and Martin describes the turmoil within the characters. One thing of note Martin did a horrible job of describing battles in the first book, and he starts the same way in this book. Meaning he doesn't describe the battles, you hear about the battles, but the reader never takes part, so your imagination can come up with anything, because nothing is set in stone, because Martin never gave you the details. The most important battle of the book Martin does describe, and guess what? He does a great job, it's the most exciting part of the book. But as usual, he takes the reader out of mid-battle, and you hear the rest second hand. This is the one instance of a battle scene, where I agree with Martin, because he leaves the reader not quite believing the outcome. And the reader can assume anything because Martin did not describe the end of the battle, so one can assume anything can happen in the future books. Martin is a strong believer that length equates into epic, which is wrong, Michael Moorcock used to write epic Elric novels that came in at 200 pages. And the problem with this is, in first 275 pages all chapters start with a character seeing a comet, and Martin describes his or her interpretation of what this comet means to them. It was very tedious to the point I was saying ""please don't start this chapter with another comet reference"". But after 275 pages of character development, we get into the meat of the story, and it is meaty. I really enjoyed the last 500+ pages of the book. It was exciting, mature fantasy, and kept me turning the pages. So, I ending up enjoying this novel quite a bit. But, for the amount of content that we the reader receive, this book should have come in at 500-600 pages, rather than the almost 900 it came in at. An editor is needed, and the reader has to suffer the unnecessary chapters, but I will admit wading through the bad will produce a positive result, because this was a good book. So I found some flaws this this book, but the good outweighed the bad, and the result was a very good book. Better than the first in the series, imo. one last thing of note, whereas we didn't hear much of magic in the first book, we start to see a lot more of it in this book. So it is starting to take a turn away from typical Medieval Fantasy, and starting to turn into wondrous fantasy.","2007-03-23","United States","","true","30","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7YV9XKJAKHMW"
"B000FC1HBY","5","Timeless Storytelling","Sometimes we take for granted the ease in which entertainment comes to us. We live in an era where books, movies, television and music is literally at our fingertips. The push of a button or two gives us access to any of these mediums. With so many new books entering the market, why do so many of us choose to read a series that began over fifteen years ago? Good writing, intriguing stories and relatable characters — that’s why. This is a difficult book to review because it is one part of a larger whole. Those skillful hands that began stitching the patchwork story in the first novel nimbly continue, giving us, at times, a clearer understanding of events. New threads are being added and we aren’t sure what image they are going to show us when all is said and done. But each new strand rivets us to the story and we become emotionally invested. As I read A Clash of Kings, many things popped out at me from a writing standpoint. Martin has populated these books with a multitude of characters. In truth, I can’t name them all. It’s a no-no in the publishing world to do such a thing, so how does this author get away with it? The main characters are extraordinary, that’s how. Arya Stark, Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen (to name only a few) are memorable. They have faults and virtues, they are multi-faceted, ever growing and changing. The words on the page are at times beautiful. Even while characters are hacking each others heads off, Martin commands the language expertly. For example: “The long low note lingered at the edge of hearing. The sentries at the ring wall stood still in their footsteps, breath frosting and heads turned toward the west. As the sound of the horn faded, even the wind ceased to blow. Men rolled from their blankets and reached for spears and swordbelts, moving quietly, listening. A horse whickered and was hushed. For a heartbeat it seemed as if the whole forest were holding its breath. The brothers of the Night’s Watch waited for a second blast, praying they should not hear it, fearing that they would.” This passage is written in such a way to allow the reader to see and hear what’s happening. As a result, the anxiety seeps into you as it does the characters. This world and its inhabitants combine familiar and mysterious elements written in such a way that it’s as if we’ve lived there all our lives. I found myself torn between wanting to read constantly until I’d finished and holding back so that I could remain immersed in the world for as long as possible. I should have the third book in the A Song of Ice and Fire series soon. I’m ready to continue the journey, anxious even.","2013-12-12","United States","","true","31","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RO4SBJSL5WRFJ"
"B000FC1HBY","5","The wolves, forced to leave their royal nest in Winterfell, matured and toughened amidst treachery and adversity.","GRRM's second installment sent me soaring to new peaks of enjoyment like no fantasy novels ever did for me. It dawned on me why good people like Ned Stark, the king's hand, must die and Winterfell must fall. The pack of young wolves fled their comfortable nest to all corners of Westeros and would mature and their claws sharpened amidst adversity and treachery. While these young cub wolves' developed their killer and self-preservation skills, they never lost their kindness, goodness and honor. True to their honorable Starks qualities no doubt because they were raised well by their good and honorable parents Ed and Catelyn Stark. Even Jon, the half Stark possessed such noble qualities, who more than any of the wolves, must grow up in the most dangerous environment of all as a black. At the wall and beyond, which seems more frightening adventures will be told. Each wolf with their unique skills and destinies, one follows breathtakingly their fortunes and we smile when fate introduced special people into their lives to guard our wolves. Sam for Jon, Lady Tallis for Robb, Hodor, Osha, Meera & Jojien for Bran and Rikkon, Jaqen & Gendry for Arya and finally the beast or more accurately, Dontos Hollard the drunk & Sandor Clegane the Hound, must love and protect their little bird, the beautiful poker face Sansa who must hide her feelings from the evil King Joffrey and the even more evil queen mother Cersei. Without the hound, Sansa would have long perished. I love the wolves, but my favorite character is Tyrion Lannister the half man, whose wit and humor surpasses even that of squire Sancho Panza from Don Quixote. His plotting and scheming against queen sister Cersei, Lord Varys the Eunuch, little finger Baelish the master of coin, and grand maester Pycelle of the 7 kingdoms is legendary. Although Tyrion is a half man, he has a heart bigger than most men and is a perfect gentleman who has huge soft sport for helpless maidens, especially those with a pure heart. That rules out his sister Cersei obviously. Such gallant qualities make Tyrion so endearing, not even his dear beautiful brother Jamie can match. Moving over eastwards overseas and no less exciting, one must not forget the fugitive dragon Princess Daenery who blossomed from the immense hardship of life in the largely barren, dusty and dry Essos. With the ever so faithful and ganllant Sir Jorah Mormont protecting her, the fair and beautiful young and last surviving Targaryen had her full share of treacherous villains who couldn't keep their hands off her baby dragons. While the seven kingdoms on Westeros are embroiled in their game of thrones, it seems the more formidable characters loom north of the wall and east on Essos. With endless of possibilities, gallantry and treachery, I now embark on GRRM's third installment and tremble with uncontrollable excitement.","2014-09-29","United States","","true","32","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VDOTPFK1VJWL"
"B000FC1HBY","4","Low note ending, fantastic writing","With the advent of the HBO series, the books have become a hot item for readers and curious non-readers alike. Most notably, individuals want to know and experience the differences between the series and the books, but also to gain more knowledge about the characters and the land in which they live. Having read this book well before the TV series, and having read it again after watching the show, it is interesting to see the liberties HBO took and what they kept the same. As per most of my reviews, the book is, of course, better. Robert Baratheon is dead, and Joffrey Baratheon (most refer to him as Joffrey Lannister since he has no Baratheon blood in him) sits the Iron Throne with his Queen Regent mother, Cersei, presiding. The Hand of the King, Eddard Stark, is also dead from beheading decreed by the Lannisters, and war is upon the Seven Kingdoms. Robb Stark claims to be the King of the North, Renly and Stannis Baratheon both battle each other and Joffrey for the Iron Throne, Lord Tywin fights for he Lannisters cause, and Daenerys Targaryen is left to try to figure out what to do amongst the Dothraki now that her Khal is, also, dead. Having killed off some of the best characters, this book is strangely lacking for people to like. The running winners is often Jon Snow, Arya Stark, and Tyrion Lannister just because they are the outsiders, Daenerys as well. The book focuses on the clash between the kings, hence the title, but there are hardly any battles. This also makes it difficult to plod through the book. Thankfully, Martin is a fantastic writer and he is able to keep and hold interest quite a deal. There is also a lot more misdirection to keep the reader on the edge of their seats and continually entranced in reading. For example, magic makes a bigger to-do in this book, and curiosity is piqued as to what lies beyond the infamous ice Wall at the northernmost reaches of the kingdoms. There is definitely a goal in this second book of the series to reaffirm and to help the readers realize the depth and complexity of the characters left to be complex. This will help as the series progresses. Overall, a good read, albeit slow, and definitely necessary for the series. It does, however, pale in comparison to the first book and even ends on a bit of a low note.","2009-12-12","United States","","true","33","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZLUJDKOJQ1CV"
"B000FC1HBY","5","An example of a Fantasy Master at the top of his game","A Clash of Kings is the sequel to A Game of Thrones (see MadProfessah's other reviews) in George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire award-winning fantasy series. The first book has been adapted to the source material for HBO's first season of its televised adaptation called Game of Thrones (which debuted Sunday April 17th., 2011) A Clash of Kings is an astonishing achievement. It is a gigantic book, chock full of battles, betrayals and brutalities. The main plot of the story is ""The War of the Five Kings."" With King Robert Barratheon dead, there are five men claiming the Iron Throne: Joffrey Baratheon, the teenaged son of his Queen, the evil Cersei Lannister; Renly Baratheon, Robert's handsome younger brother; Stannis Baratheon, Robert's stern older brother; Robb Stark, son of Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell and self-proclaimed King of the North; and Balon Greyjoy, who has declared himself King of the Iron Islands. The story in A Clash of Kings follows immediately the events at the end of A Game of Thrones. Events are told from the perspectives of each of several characters, both familiar and new. Many of our favorites from the first book, such as Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Arya Stark, Daenerys Targaryen and Catelyn Stark return with chapters of their own. Of course, there are also chapters told from the perspective of new characters such as Davos Seaworth (who is in the employ of Stannis Baratheon) and Theon Greyjoy (son of Balon Greyjoy who grew up with the Stark children at Winterfell). Additionally, Arya's sister Sansa Stark has some chapters devoted to her perspective as well which make her a far less annoying character than she appeared to be in the first book. Martin is pretty ruthless with the fates of his characters. One never knows who will survive, even if they are a character who has a chapter named after them. This feature of the book greatly increases the level of suspense for the reader and the emotional impact of the story on the reader. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire is truly one of the great masterpieces of speculative fiction, a sprawling, messy, detailed work of art which will delight and despair readers for decades. Title: A Clash of Kings. Author: George R.R. Martin Length: 784 pages. Publisher: Bantam. Date: May 28, 2002. OVERALL GRADE: A (4.0/4.0). PLOT: A+. IMAGERY: A. IMPACT: A.

"B000FC1HBY","5","A stellar fantasy and a great addition to the series...","After having read the first few books in the series over ten years ago in the late nineties I felt like I was forgetting huge portions of the plot as I read through book 4 and the recent entry in the series in A Dance with Dragons. I am even more amazed with the second read through of A Clash of Kings than I was with the first read through. Where Martin excels is his ability to transport the reader to another time and become absorbed with his detail. He is one of the few authors who isn't afraid to create a great character, only to kill them off (book 1 spoiler: insert Eddard Stark). Or to create truly awful characters that really make your blood boil just reading about them (insert Cersei and Joffrey). This is why this series is so great and A Clash of Kings is just as good if not better than A Game of Thrones. While you don't read too much about Joffrey and Robb except in passing, you certainly see plenty of action amidst the kings. We have several clashes of kings throughout the book that are momentous and huge, that make you eagerly read on to find out what happens. Tyrion takes on a much more prominent role not only in the series but at King's Landing, while Jon is front and center as the watch delves deeper beyond the wall in pursuit of the wildlings. Theon takes a front and center role in this one as he tries to prove to his dad and family that he is ironborn and pisses sea salt like they do. In the end you are left with the first 700 pages as captivating and interesting, and then the final 300 pages absolutely riveting (a trend of Martin's; everything escalates so that the last 300 or so pages have you glued to the book). I found in the second read through that Martin was hinting at a lot to happen in future books. Take Daenerys meeting with the Undying and the prophecies they gave to her. Many have happened throughout the book and in other books in the series, some even happened in book 5. My first read through I wouldn't have known, but my second read through made them glaringly obvious. A stellar fantasy and a great addition to the series. 5 stars.","2011-09-26","United States","","true","35","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3Q5GO554468ZU"
"B000FC1HBY","5","One of the Great Sagas","I'm reading the books and watching the HBO series and fining that I love them both especially because of theirs differences. If you're an avid reader, A Game of Thrones, and by that I mean all of the books in this series, are a true must read. At the writing of this review, George R. R. Martin has released five of the seven books he says will eventually be published in this saga. I've just finished book two and can scarcely write this review fast enough to start on book three, which I already have downloaded. I'd like to mention too that this is the first time I've ever tried whisper sync available through Kindle & Audible.com. I knew about it before it had really been released to the public as it was recommended for my son to enhance his reading skills as he works on improving his reading despite his dyslexia. We found that hearing the words read while he read them himself not only gave him confidence, but improved his reading alone and fostered a love of reading that I'd never seen in him before. Since whisper sync has been advertised as truly immersing you in a book more so than you'd find in reading alone, I thought I'd try it while Amazon & Audible.com offered a 3month free trial. Since then, I've found that I truly am finding myself more thoroughly transported to the place & time period of the books I'm reading. A Clash of Kings is the second book I've read this way and I already have the third book downloaded from both Kindle & Audible. I've been an avid reader for many years and certainly don't need the book read to me but I've found that reading the book while also listening to it gives the story a whole other dimension that I never thought possible. I don't see myself using whisper sync on every book that I read now, but here are some, such as this series, where I find it thoroughly enjoyable. So that said, I happily give 5 stars to A Clash of Kings, the Song of Fire and Ice saga, and the narration. They all deserve high praise.","2015-06-10","United States","","true","36","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2H4Q8VXN8ZSOP"
"B000FC1HBY","4","“I’m certain of nothing but winter and battle”","With The Winds of Winter strongly believed to land on many readers’ long awaiting lists and shelves this year (forgive this summer child for her optimism if for any reason this does not come to pass), I join those who have been testing leonine patience and preparing vivid cracking imagination for the next bout of ultimate betrayals, brutal struggles for survival and one uncomfortable throne made of a thousand swords. A Clash of Kings (A Song of Ice and Fire, book 2) is my second scheduled revisit to the enthralling world of Westeros and Essos and it simply astonishes me no matter how many times I reread favorite passages I notice some singularly hidden nugget of a wicked quip, new comparisons to our own history with striking twists and another appreciation for the fully shaded characters that populate the seven kingdoms and my outside conversations (sometimes to the exasperation of my tired nighttime coworkers). This is one novel that certainly keeps me awake after having a taste on a lunch break promising to linger in my whirling mind as time creeps on those long shifts. I get such joy sharing this series of stories with anyone sitting near and catch their eyes roving over the enchanting covers or the thickness of the book. I do tend to admit some novels in A Song of Ice and Fire (A Clash of Kings among that listing) are better than others and encourage all to begin with A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, book 1) for the foundation of the rampant adventure and unforgettable maneuvers of personalities (for good or evil) that will follow but the choice to begin turning the pages where they will is ultimately up to them. Although some chapters (or points of view spread across the included maps) create more exciting visions depending on the reader’s ever discerning mood, it is all worth the effort to finish and share with those who have not heard the call or simply need another reason to escape our own world for seven others.","2017-02-12","United States","","true","37","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNEXJYNVONGG5"
"B000FC1HBY","5","Tyrion Takes Center Stage","Back in October 1998, I was working in the Gallery Place neighborhood of Washington, D.C., when on a lark I went into the old Olson's book store (RIP) near the Shakespeare Theater on my lunch break. The science fiction and fantasy section of the store was pretty meager, but it was the only bookstore in the neighborhood, and I had time to kill. As I scanned the titles on the single row of hardbacks, my eye caught something I couldn't believe I was seeing -- A Clash of Kings by George R.R. Martin. Sitting on the shelf, a good three weeks before street date. Of course, I bought it -- I was incredibly thrilled at my luck. No other fans had read it! When I got home, I posted the chapter list on Usenet, and to my surprise, almost every single response claimed that I was lying. I chalked it up to sour grapes and finished the book before it event hit the street. Now, thirteen years later, I have just re-read A Clash of Kings as part of my epic re-read of A Song of Ice and Fire corresponding with both the HBO television adaptation of Game of Thrones, and the imminent release of Dance With Dragons. Clash of Kings is still an immensely great book, which like the first, centers on the arrival of a new king's Hand -- in this case, the unlikely Hand, Tyrion Lannister -- in King's Landing. Unlike Ned Stark, however, Tyrion is much better equipped to deal with court politics, but a different set of personal weaknesses endanger his reign. Meanwhile, war engulfs the river lands, Robert's brothers Renly and Stannis both vie for the Iron Throne, Dany continues her journey to the east, and the Night's Watch strikes out to discover where all the Wildings have vanished to. Theon Greyjoy is added as POV character, and along with Tyrion, offers one of the most interesting arcs in the book. It's somewhat easy for Clash of Kings to be overshadowed by Storm of Swords (the best in the series thus far) and Game of Thrones, but there is still much to recommend about it. The ending is both sad and hopeful at the same time, a true Empire Strikes Back style ending, and Martin begins to turn the screws on his characters in ways that not even Game of Thrones could anticipate.","2011-05-20","United States","","true","38","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R68VHNC57UQW"
"B000FC1HBY","4","Clash of Kings and too many others","I've just finished the ""Clash of Kings"" and am ready for the 3rd book in the series. As other reviewers have stated this is adult science fiction with just the right amount of fantasy. Consequently it generally is more like a traditional novel. I only gave it 4 stars because as the many royal houses took sides and fought each other, so many characters were introduced only to be written off, and it was hard to keep track of them all. Thank god for the list of characters at the end. The book has several main characters who move the plot forward. These are great characters and their development is well done. They absolutely hook you into the story and it's hard not to love or feel sympathetic to them all. The Imp, Tyrion Lannisater, is a wonderful and his words often make me laugh out loud. But note, the characters are in different places, apart from each other, and provide different points of view as to what is happening. Therefore as you finish one chapter devoted to one character, the author jumps to another to move the plot along, leaving you feeling somewhat stranded. But not to worry, the next character's story is one your glad to read more of and soon captures your interest. The story is often dark and given the many battles fought a bit gory. But I've learned to skip over these parts (I'm a woman) and read just enough to know where the things are going. But it's not all dark and actually ends on an uplifting note. I recently had foot surgery, so I have had lots of time to read this book. I think in doing so I was better able to enjoy it. It's just not the kind of book to pick up and read a bit here and there. It's too easy to forget what's going on. In other words this is a book to become totally immersed in. I really liked the story and characters and found it addictive. It's been a long time since I found a book I couldn't put down. I'm looking forward to seeing how HBO handles this wide ranging storyline.","2011-11-28","United States","","true","39","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2L68S2MCKGLOT"
"B000FC1HBY","4","Series Still Incredibly Entertaining....Author Still Incredibly Perverted","A Clash of Kings has the same tone, plot structure and generally focuses on the same characters as the A Game of Thrones (the first book in the series). The vibe is the same so if you liked the first book you will likely enjoy this one as well. The character development is the best aspect of this series. Some characters you love, some you hate, some intrigue you, some repulse you but across the board you will feel strongly about all the characters one way or another and that is a testiment to Martin's skill. After reading a Game of Thrones I noted in my review that the amount and detail of the sexual violence and humiliation directed towards women was deeply disturbing. I suspected that the author had dark issues related to women and seemed to enjoy writing about rape. After reading A Clash of Kings I am now 100% certain that the author gets off on writing about the sexual humiliation of women. (If you thought the rape of the lamb women by Dothraki pillagers was bad in A Game of Thrones just wait and see what Martin has in store for you in this book including the public gang rape of an underage retarded girl by 50 F-I-F-T-Y men. Be prepared to read about women being stripped naked and bent over into stocks 24 hours a day to be raped by countless numbers of men at their leisure). I mean seriously, what type of perverted and damaged mind could come up with this stuff let alone take such obvious delight in writing about it? I took off 2 stars due to the sexual violence in the first book but this time I am only taking off one star because the rape is so ridiculously prevelant and constant and over the top that I am effectively becoming desensitized to it. Seriously if you did a shot everytime a woman was raped, sexually assualted and humiliated in this book you would be drunk constantly and you would not sober up for two weeks after you had finished the book. I will continue to read this series even I am convinced the author is a misogynistic pervert who is indulging his disgusting fetishes through his books. I feel guilty about it and I feel like I am actively killing a part of my soul by continuing to read these books but it can't be helped. I am invested in these characters now and I can't deny that the series is insanely entertaining.","2007-10-23","United States","","true","40","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KRAF7JI5M0MA"
"B000FC1HBY","5","Brilliant fantastical story continues and never for a minute disappoints","***SPOILER ALERT: Read at your own risk!**** Finished with the second masterpiece by George R.R.Martin and I LOVED it. I am shocked that I enjoy Martin's fantasy world as much as I do and take it as seriously as I do, but to me, there is a realness behind the horror, the atrocity, the sadness, the desperation, the hopelessness and yet the hope in that hopelessness, the characters - oh my, the characters - and I want so badly to be a part of this world. My hope is for Arya Stark to become the ultimate dark beast .... I envision her as a little mouse on the outside and a monster of a wolf on the inside who goes on to take revenge after revenge on the Stark family's ""misfortunes"". Clash of Kings continues the brilliant story we left behind in A Game of Thrones and it has to be read as part of the series - I know that's obvious but my cousin just said she watched Season 2 of the show without having watched Season 1 and I nearly chocked on my food. Some stuff you just don't do. The similarity to the show is not as close as it was with Season 1 but this is the original work and I appreciate the differences. The role of Robb Stark is incredibly minor and always through other characters. I felt he might have a bigger role and be a part story teller but no such hope. My ultimate favorite characters remain Arya, Jon Snow, Tyrion, in that order. I suppose I should feel sorry for Sansa but I haven't forgotten her stupid choice to run to the queen in Season 1 and essentially get her father beheaded by her selfish desires and by being utterly stupid about the ways of the court and the world. And I can't decide whom I hate more: Joffrey Baratheon or Theon Greyjoy. It's really a toss-up, but at least we get to enjoy some Theon torturing in Season 3. That reminds me, I am off to reading A Storm of Swords.","2013-09-24","United States","","true","41","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WP4NPRROHY6L"
"B000FC1HBY","4","Just as good as the first","In the wake of King Robert's death, four men lay claim to his crown. The Mother of Dragons builds her khalazar as magic slowly returns to the world. Jon Snow braves the wilds beyond the Wall. Tyrion Lannister struggles to hold the power behind the Throne. And Winterfell harbors a viper in its midst... Like I said before, it's hard to write a teaser for a book this size. Look at it! You could club a narwhal to death with it if you were so inclined. The epic of The Song of Ice and Fire continues to unfold in the second volume. Robb Stark, the King in the North, continues his campaign to avenge his father and take the Iron Throne. His sister Sansa remains in King's Landing, still betrothed to the vile Joffrey. Arya, well, she has quite a bit going on. Jon Snow continues being my favorite character as he ventures beyond the wall, probably marking him for death sometime soon. I'm wondering if the Starks will ever be reunited. In non-Stark news, Tyrion Lannister continues being the best character in the series and pulls the strings behind the scenes. The conflict between Robert's brothers Stannis and Renly came to a head much earlier than I thought. Jaime Lannister is still in the clink and I'm hoping he and Robb Stark get more screen time in the next book. And Theon! What a colossal douche! Cercei Lannister has a lot more facets to her character than I originally thought. Much like the last book, most of the action happens near the end. I love the constant intrigue behind the scenes. The battle of Blackwater Bay was my favorite battle in the series so far. Since I read this without seeing season 2 of Game of Thrones, I'm looking forward to the following events being depicted on the show: 1. Jon Snow beyond the Wall 2. Tyrion's dialog with Cercei early on 3. the battle of Blackwater","2013-02-28","United States","","true","42","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SO98ZUQQGRWN"
"B000FC1HBY","4","Good read, but padded...","I'm admittedly new to George Martin's writing, but no novice reader. I'm an avid sci-fi/fantasy reader since the 70's. So I have a standard perhaps different than most modern readers, as my review will reflect. Mr. Martin does an able job of creating a world and characters we can enter to suspend disbelief, but he is no J.R.R. Tolkein. As I am sure he is well aware, Mr. Martin's real life world views and beliefs are as far apart as night & day, and his writing reveals it. Tolkein was a Oxford University Professor of languages whose Christian faith formed and informed his writing to the point of making it analogous in many respects. Mr. Martin's work reflects no such understand and appreciation. By contrast, George Martin paints a world for us which reaffirms no timeless divine principles of truth, right & wrong, or morality. It's a dark world where near pointless violence and barbarity exists to the point of being pornographic. It's religious references are all paganistic in kind and confusing at best. If anything, it accurately reflects the kind of world the Author may actually be when stripped of it's historical context and Christian influence. My final criticism is an all too common one nowadays I'm afraid: Like most aspiring Authors who would find a place among the ""Greats"", Mr. Martin has tried to compensate for a lack of depth with the most shallow appeal to the reader's prurient desires in pornographic depictions and situations. It is a shabby device, and one beneath a great writer's work. To the good, if he weens himself from such he will make a great writer, and not just a publisher of many words of little substance. As a Christian historian and former Pastor, I make no apologies for my biases in this review. I do not wholly advise against reading Mr. Martin's works, just that readers do so with a fair warning as to it's heavily pornographic nature.","2013-01-08","United States","","true","43","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JNOLNKKR5TA5"

"B000FC1HBY","5","It's the sequel that was promised","Thank God for HBO, because without the breakout series ""Game of Thrones"" I would've never been motivated to read George R.R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire."" The second installation of the saga, ""A Clash of Kings"" is a riveting sequel that picks up right where ""A Game of Thrones"" ended. Martin does a superb job of alternating the perspectives of beloved (or hated) characters such as Tyrion Lannister, Arya Stark, Jon Snow, Theon Greyjoy, or Ser Davos Seaworth. Reading this book is just like watching the second season of the show as the on-screen adaptation is very faithful to the text. Martin effectively paints graphic scenes with almost-eerie descriptions but he excels most at his vast array of complex characters. Unlike countless other novels in which a character is fully-good or fully evil, Martin shows us the moral high-points and pitfalls of his characters that make rooting for one or disapproving of another character a test of the reader's character. For example, we're expected to love Catelyn Stark because she's a noble lady who wants to avenge her late husband and save her children. But on the other hand, she's a selfish leader, reckless politician, and her unjustified contempt for Jon Snow is disgusting. The same goes for a character like Stannis Baratheon. Stannis is described as a hard, stubborn man who most noble lords can barely stomach. He's an adulterer and is seduced by the human-embodiment of a bizarre religion. And yet, there is something admirable about his resolve to avenge Ned Stark and his fearlessness towards the Lannisters is surprisingly inspiring. Case in point, EACH of these MANY characters are expertly written. This book may be a daunting 969 pages, but Martin's mastery of words will make you read pages by the hundreds faster than you would've imagined.","2016-08-27","United States","","true","45","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11EUKPU7N8F1T"
"B000FC1HBY","5","Martin continues a top-notch series","I've already made the extremely bold statement about Game of Thrones that this series is second only to Tolkien. Several aspects make this series outstanding: The characters, the unpredictability, and the harsh realism. The characters are what make this series so good. Martin writes each book from several characters' points of view. The suspense is so well done that you find yourself jumping ahead to that character's next chapter just to see what happens. The characters are extremely well developed, and by writing from their point of view, Martin helps you understand the way they think and act. Every character is fascinating, but there is a handful that I just can't get enough of (Arya, Tyrion). Every character is complex--there are very, very few characters that you can categorize as ""good"" or ""evil."" Instead, characters are a realistic mix of selfish flaws and good intentions. The realism of ASOIAF doesn't end with the characters. In most fantasy books, the author will never kill off a main character. This results in no suspense, as you never fear for a character. This leads to such predictability that it can really detract from a reading experience. This norm is never farther from the truth than in ASOIAF. In Martin's books, no one is safe. Just read Game of Thrones and be prepared to be shocked. Once Martin shows you he's not afraid to kill anyone, it adds so much suspense to the rest of the series. Everything about these books have an air of harsh reality. Folks, these books ain't no Harry Potter, and their not for kids. They describe a dark but enthralling world where violence, incest and rape are commonplace. But anyone who knows anything about the Middle Ages knows these times were not Disneyland. This adds to the realism and suspense. In the back of my mind I have a fear this series could turn into another Robert Jordan debacle, spanning to 10+ books in the series. But then I think, I don't care if this series takes 20 books to finish--every book is so absolutely enjoyable that I hope it doesn't end. A Clash of Kings introduces several new fascinating characters (such as Brienne). This book features major battles and definitely keeps the plot moving.","2006-09-12","United States","","true","46","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAT40D0RXW1EV"
"B000FC1HBY","3","Most is excellent, Some ... just read the review","Let me start by saying I loved A Game of Thrones and I couldn't put Clash of Kings down during anything to do with Tyrion, Catelyn, Renly, or Stannis, etc. That's not the point, I'm sure several other people have used an indefinite amount of adjectives and similes to praise their love for this book and everything in it. For those parts I fall right in line. The bad: Daenerys... and to a lesser extent Jon (but hear me out). In A Game of Thrones I accepted Daenerys as a legitimate character and was interested in her portion of the story. It seemed that she was connected to Westeros in some meaningful way. People there actually mentioned her and (indirectly) interacted with her. She was tied to the story and her arc seemed to be building to something grander particularly with her climax in hatching the dragons. She might be a major player in this game of thrones! However in A Clash of Kings I began to find it more and more difficult to actually read the Daenerys chapters. She no longer had any connection to the main plot, I don't remember if she was mentioned by anyone on Westeros even once in the story. Her story also slowed to a crawl. She gained some followers (not many) but lost some; she traveled to a city and sat but then left for another city where she sat. She may have had some interactions in both, more so in the second involving some maegi people. None of it seemed to have any meaning. The certain characters may or may not have had ties to parts of the lore, but otherwise were meaningless words on meaningless pages while I strived to stay awake until the end of that chapter - the good part. Seriously, if she has no part in the story then why is she there, especially if it destroys the pacing of the rest of the story? Jon's parts also seemed to create rifts in the overall pacing for me, and I ended up dreading his chapters. Don't get me wrong, I love his character and what's happening in his story, but it slowed down much too far during his chapters. If I may, I'd also like to bring up the fact that in this series there doesn't seem to really be any overarching plotline whatsoever. Sure the beings from beyond the wall seem to be getting ready for some sort of invasion (maybe) and that is a big part of Jon's storyline, so the book does keep an overarching plot doesn't it? Then what does the rest of the book have to do with anything? Yes it is an alive world where things happen that aren't connected to anything else, but if I'm going to spend the hours out of my day to read a 900+ page book in a series of 900+ page books, dammit make everything be MEANINGFUL to me and to the story. For me right now, I might just as well read a detailed book on various presidents of the United States or leaders of other countries. But maybe it's because I'm not a fan of soap operas and boiling down all the elements of this and its predecessor reveals this as such.","2012-07-05","United States","","true","47","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C3AOWM3WW6EA"

"B000FC1HBY","3","Good but not great,","While Game of Thrones was easily one of the best written fantasy novels I have read with brilliant plot structure, amazingly developed characters and tip top prose, unfortunately Clash of Kings fails to hold up on its own. All GRRM does is lengthen his story by adding several hundred pages of plot and description that does nothing to solve or even to address the issues from Game of Thrones. Characters disappear, story lines fade into nothing and for no more than to spur along the story to the next installment. I mean if I have to read about ANOTHER standard or the description of arms, armor and banners or one more word about how to best season capons or the taste of gooseberries and cream I might never read GRRM again. Don't get me wrong the writing is excellent, he knows how to spin a yarn and keep you interested, for a while. The villains go from frustrating to just annoying every time they make horrible choice after horrible choice, only to be saved by one of GRRM literary miracles riding over the hill to save the day. Its tiresome. Once is exciting, twice is a trend, three times I just want to put my head through a wall. And I wish we could say he only does this thrice, but its his ""go to"" move when he wants to end story lines quickly to get ready for a sequel. For someone who expressly wants the reader to realize that their are truly no fairy tales, GRRM seems to rely on them to move his story along another 1000 pages. Tolkien did not need to lead his readers by the nose to foster drama, he let the story speak for itself and what GRRM does with 1000 pages, Shakespeare would do in a single act still keeping all the tension, emotions, drama and joy of the plot intact. GRRM is a great writer, that is not at question, but I would caution those who read Game of Thrones and expect more of the same: be prepared to read all of the books, because questions developed within the first 100 pages of Game of Thrones will not be answered for pages and pages latter or not at all. So if you want a good story with great characters and you have the time and patience, read the series. IF not, there are plenty of better, shorter stories available, Lord of the Rings, Once and Future King and the Shannara Series by Brooks. The Best I can say about Clash of Kings is that its a bridge to the rest of the series. You will get frustrated by the introduction of many new characters and the lack of conclusions from the old, that I can guarantee.","2011-05-09","United States","","true","52","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ITQ4YDLLEY94"
"B000FC1HBY","5","Clash of Kings Review","As always every book from the Song of Ice and Fire series is amazing. This is the second book to the series and I love the allegories of this book which can be related to reality where power grab is common and often the order of the day. This books pick up from where the Game of Thrones left after the throne was succeeded by the son of Robert Baratheon, Joffrey Baratheon. Yet his succession to the Iron Throne is packed with controversies. This is the very same reason that prompted others to claim for the same throne. But what I find to be most frustrating was Stannis is claim to the throne is based on his legitimate succession as the eldest sibling of the former king but why the hell would his younger brother Renly made the same claim? Wouldn’t it be great if Stannis and Renly were on the same side against the Lannisters but that is how deep and complex the story and plots of the series that’s why I love it. I reccommend this to all the fans of the Game of Thrones series and those who are seeking books that has some element of political allegories in it. The same reason why I am reading the series aside from being fan of the popular TV series. As I said above the series is amazing and enlightening as I look at it from the perspective of political allegory.","2019-01-28","United States","","true","53","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13BCD8K4TR6ZP"
"B000FC1HBY","5","Read A GAME OF THRONES","Clearly, since I've given A CLASH OF KINGS a five-star rating, it's safe to conclude that I liked it. A lot, as a matter of fact. But that doesn't mean you will. Most of the other reviewers here appear to have liked it, but not all of them by any means. Many have also described the book and/or the leading characters, so I won't try to improve on that. Instead, I will simply pass along my thoughts, as follows: You should not even consider reading A CLASH OF KINGS unless you have already read A GAME OF THRONES, its predecessor. If you've read A GAME OF THRONES and liked it, you will almost certainly like A CLASH OF KINGS. It's more of the same tale, with all of the strengths of the first book carried forward. By the same token, if you didn't like the first book (for whatever reasons), don't bother with this one. Personally, after reading these two books, I feel that this series is one of the top fantasy series in print. I don't happen to feel that it's quite on a par with Tolkien, as some have asserted. Tolkien, a life-long English scholar, wrote with an elegance that few can match (not to take anything away from Martin, he's just not quite in that class). Tolkien's work also had a touch of sympathy and humor that isn't present here. These books are fascinating and well-written, but there is scarcely a hint of humor and little sympathy in them. Frodo has no loyal Samwise here. Nevertheless, the complexity, intricate plotting, depth of characterization, and ability and willingness of the author to surprise the reader are first-rate. Nobody is safe in these books and there's not always a clear division between ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"". There's no opportunity for the committed reader to become complacent. Simply put, I think this is great stuff, and a lot of other people agree. If you're wavering over whether or not to give this series a try, then DO it. Hesitate no longer. But don't start here, start with A GAME OF THRONES.","2003-04-20","United States","","true","54","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IZGQ5JZATGGN"
"B000FC1HBY","3","Great Military Strategy, But Loose Ending","I have read the first two books from the Song of Ice and Fire, and I think it's worthwhile to mention I did not watch the TV series at all, although I watched 10minutes of it which had incredible effects and accurate characters which fit the books description perfectly. That said, my view on the written series is not bias toward the TV adaptation. A Clash of Kings introduced the war that was looming over Game of Thrones throughout it's story. I found the characters very well developed in this book, much like the debut novel. A difference between the sequel and the debut is most obviously the strong use of military strategy and tactics which was very interesting to read. Also in this book is the unfolding of chaotic events, which wasn't seen in Game of Thrones. I can say with a certainty that I did enjoy the majority of this book, and I actually bought it on my Kindle immediately after finishing Game of Thrones to see what happens next. And my reasoning for this is exactly what turned me off of the series after the second book. From the first book, the ending left many important questions unanswered, which felt to me like a weekly TV series cliffhanger. I personally enjoy to have a certain conclusion of some main events at the end of a book. And in a series I feel that the wide-open ending felt more like a single book rather than a sequel. I tolerated this cliffhanger in the first novel, but after reading this title, I was very discouraged from reading the series anymore. The book stops right at parts of the plot that are not yet complete by any means. This is understandable in a war scenario; however, there was not enough closure in the end of the book to satisfy my need to have a meaningful conclusion in any book (even those in a series). This was much like the first book, which compelled me to impulsively buy the sequel. But when I found that the series remained largely inconclusive even after the second book, I had enough. For those who like open ended books and those who read through series relatively quickly, this series may be for you, and as such I would recommend to it to that particular audience. For those lik me who desire some level of closure at the end of a long novel, I do not recommend this series at all. If the storyline interests you then I would suggest watching the TV series which seems to be very well produced and accurate (although apparently lacking a few occurrences here and there). I hope you all have a great reading experience whether from ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" (if its your type of structured writing style), another series or standalone book.

"B000FC1HBY","5","New Characters, New Lands and Shocking Reversals of Fortune","George R.R. Martin's ""A Clash of Kings"" is the second volume in the continuing ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" epic fantasy series. Book two makes it clear that the success of ""A Game of Thrones"" was no fluke; Martin is supremely capable writer who weaves intricate plots and paints fascinating character portraits. He is also building, kingdom-by-kingdom, a rich tapestry of cultures and religions in his fictional land of Westeros. This volume has an increased emphasis on warfare, supernatural and mythological events, and sea-faring cultures and characters. There are also some surprising turns of events in the latter half of the novel - victory snatched from the jaws of defeat, and vice versa - that are incredibly memorable. Old characters like Tyrion Lannister and Bran Stark show themselves to be increasingly capable and confident, while an expanded cast of new characters give perspectives sympathetic to the challengers to the throne. It's true that the story of ""A Clash of Kings"" is less self-contained than that of ""A Game of Thrones,"" but there is just so much action and intrigue here that it's hard to fault Martin for tying anything up and putting a bow on it. Some readers have also complained that the Daenerys storyline isn't as strong or as eventful as it was in book one, but I found one of her chapters in particular here to be the best so far in the series, offering tantalizing clues about events yet to unfold. So, in short, if you were a fan of the first novel or hooked by the HBO television series, ""A Clash of Kings"" is well worth your time.","2014-07-25","United States","","true","57","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2031C0KZD87PG"
"B000FC1HBY","4","Strong Epic Fantasy Characters and Story","""A Clash of Kings"" is the second book in the ""Song of Ice and Fire series. I thought this installment was a bit ""scattered"" in that it included major travel for every storyline, which made it a bit hard for me to keep up with where everyone was at, how armies were trying to gain the upper hand, etc. I recommend readers get acquainted with the maps so you can visualize the action. Unfortunately, the Kindle map is a little hard to read, and it doesn't zoom. Martin does an excellent job in creating some despicable characters, while at the same time building up others like Tyrion who develops a sense of honor when it suits his purposes. I like how the point of view changes throughout the book so you can more deeply understand the major characters. There are a few times when this gets frustrating as the suspense builds on a story line, and then Martin switches to a different character and a different story line. One of the things I like about this book and the series is that it doesn't overly rely on magic. There is some magic use, but it is mysterious with only a few people that have any special powers. The majority of the story relies on physical prowess with weapons, the use of military tactics, and political intrigue to manipulate events and outcomes. I enjoy watching all of these things come together as the kings clash and fight over the seven kingdoms. Warning! As with the first book, there are some sexual scenes and references. These seem true to the characters and times that Martin is depicting in the story.","2011-05-09","United States","","true","58","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R6YP1Q37VJ3L"
"B000FC1HBY","3","Good read but as predictable as the end of the first book","GRR Martin states that he wants the reader to know he isn't afraid to kill of the main characters. He want the readers to realize that when any character is in danger they are likely to be found dead in the coming pages. While this is great story telling it soon became predictable; assume the worst is likely to happen to the good guys and the bad guys will be fine. He seems to use this device to a fault, and his mechanism to make the story unpredictable makes the story even more predictable. My only complaint from the first book still holds in this book: the evil guys are cunning and intelligent while the good guys hold fast to their idealism. He drags this on till the end. Robb has won victories, sure, but out of shear determination and little cunning (he attacks at night catching the enemy unawares, not necessarily something new but a loosening from his idealism). Robb could have joined forces with Renly, but that would have too quickly ended the battle with the Lannisters so GRR Martin was forced to make him stubborn. The only intelligent good character seems to be Catelyn, but people refuse to listen to her sensibility. The Lannisters seem to be ever changing, and never still long enough to grasp onto their plans. The only one that seems to be stubborn and bullheaded is Jamie, and he is captured, probably the only thing I was surprised by in this book. But Tywin, Tyrion and Cersei are rarely ""in trouble"". Martin goes out of his way to ensure that Tyrion isn't killed; above and beyond what any ""good"" guy would be expected. I've come to the conclusion that at some point Tyrion will die, Martin has built up so much anticipation for his death yet never gone through with it. But if he is to live, I wouldn't be surprised because it is only the ""bad guys"" that can outwit. The final battle was an absurd twist of fate and far removed from reality: Twyin coming the Kings Landing's rescue in the knick of time. The absurdity! But again, I can't say I was terrible surprised by those 10 some pages describing the Lannisters victory, but more buy the absurdity. On top of that, after so little magic throughout the entirety of the first two books the sudden emergence of it from the red priestess' womb is absurd, you would almost think that Stannis is destined for victory, only to send her away and foreshadow his demise. On top of that, Loras Tyrell jumps ""sides"" with the promise of a place at the kingsgaurd. The absurd luck given to the ""bad"" made the book less unpredictable, and increasingly dull. Although, the story is still good and worth the read.","2011-06-08","United States","","true","59","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27CFFH0CSPUKS"
"B000FC1HBY","5","Love love love","I am very surprised to see such poor reviews. This series, and this author, are at the very top of my list. I have read and re-read these books. the world and the characters are so details and complex. The plot is interwoven between the many characters, and it very legnthy and intricate, and this series is not for those who require immediate gratification to say the least. The complexity and multiple story lines makes for a very long narative, so be warned. In my opinion, I love lenthy, complex stories with many characters and story lines. I actually seek them out, and I love every aspect of these books every time I've read them. For me, the characters are very real individuals. I found myself disliking some of the characters as bad/evil in the begining, but their circumstances and histories changed my mind later. I found Martn wrote chldren and woman convincingly, and a female reader I am often disappointed by sterotypical, two dimensional female characters and whiny, stupid children. I also found the castle life depicted to be gritty and realistic instead of flower and graceful as it is often depicted in fantasy books. And, this book is not flowery or kind in anyway. The characters are tormented and mistreated by each other and themselves. The world is facinating and unlik anything I'e seen. The seasons take years. When winter comes, its long and brutal. The frozen north is inhabited by an evil lost to legend, and the winter is coming. boarder defenses at the border are deminished, and no one believes there is a threat. The northern kingdom set to watch the border is lost, and the other kingdoms are all vying for power. I will wait as long as it takes before the rest of the story, and be grateful when it arrives.","2011-01-27","United States","","true","60","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3T32T0WEM9IBD"
"B000FC1HBY","5","Easily the best...","Despite my hobbies that continually surround the fantasy genre, my hatred for fantasy novels knows no bound. I puke at the lack of character development, plot driven story arcs and the lack-of-gray good or bad guys. George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series has done all the cliches: raised the bar, above and beyond reproach and easily the best epic fantasy ever. While all credit is due to the godfather of fantasy (and fantasy epics), JRR Tolkien has many children whom all drank from the teat of the first best fantasy epic, Lord of the Rings. Where GRRM differs is this: strength of plot and character development does not depend on fantastic monsters or beasts or incredible items of power but from the actual (gasp!) characters themselves. Never have I read about characters that felt real and yet heroic or despised at the same time. These people are not cookie cutter characters that you could pull from a typical fantasy novel. Their motivations and desires have an incredible foundation. It helps to understand why certain people do certain things especially when you know all the facts. One of the very things that is semi-resolved in A Clash of Kings is ""would you sacrifice someone else's child to save the life of your own children?"". It is this and so many more themes that come into play that makes this book and the series thus far a literal page turner. (Two exact weeks to finish both A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings... hopefully with A Sword of Storms, I can make it three for three.) If you like reading or fantasy at all and not necessarily both, do yourself a favour and get all three books. You will kick yourself for having to wait if you ordered separately.","2004-07-28","United States","","true","61","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E32LSSZI8UPW"

"B000FC1HBY","5","captivating characters","As in the first book the style remains the same. You don't read chapters of a saga but rather chapters of what is happening to various characters in the book. And the number of characters continue to grow! But isn't real life made of lots of people interacting and creating situations that affect others? My impression is that the books are written in a ""TV Soap"" style. We see things happening to various characters in their day to day challenges. Like in real life, the good don't necessarily succeed. Some characters you get really wrapped up in. My favorites are Tyrion, Jon, Daenerys and Arya. When I hit one of those chapters it is hard to put the book down. If you are looking for a more focused plot, you will be disappointed. You do get a sense that the plot will evenutally revole around the conflict between the enemy north of the wall, Daenerys and her dragons and the people we are currently reading about south of the wall. But for now it is a story about different individuals and how they are coping with the various pressures created by the triangle of conflict. This is not a bad thing. You sympathize for the characters in their decisions to try to deal with their situations not knowing all the details. It reads like real life situations. As the first the book is very long, almost three times a regular book. What is great, the author does not repeat or re-explain details to fill the book. It also means you really need to keep track of the characters. The book is well worth the money.

"B000FC1HBY","5","By FAR the best in the series","This was not just better than book one. It was better than the subsequent books as well in my eyes. It worried me since Eddard was killed off and a dragon appeared at the end of book one, but in the end it was great. The great focus on Tyrion in this chapter was really well done. In fact, this book fleshed out the Tyrion character so well you appreciate his wit and wisdom more than anything else in this story. After this part of the story it starts to go astray, mainly because I think the author bites off more than he can chew and kills off too many characters. That said, this portion is engaging, exciting and draws you in from beginning to end. If you watch the HBO series, be prepared, because this book will have a lot of opportunity to explode on screen. There are so many key pieces in this long book that there is no way the show will do it justice. This may be fine for the casual fan, but I was disappointed in gaps the first series left (more so on what was added instead of key portions of the book). How they will undertake the many key elements here remains to be seen. If they do it right though, Peter Dinklage will win more awards. This book was written to make that man shine. Aside from the series, this is the book you need to read in the series. Lucky for you it comes early! Read book one and two. If you do not want to trudge onward, then shut the doors there and wait for HBO to try and do the remaining books justice.

If you don't like long books this series is not for you, if you have hours and hours of driving and/or working and would like to listen to a great story to pass the time these books might be for you. It is like no story I ever listened to before because the number of people and places in the story, the amount of detail about everything in the stoy, and the lack of a main character, there are main people in the story but you never know when one is going to die, it is almost like a very long history lesson from a parallel universe than a story following a few main characters. All the way from the start to where the stoy is now I never know what is going to happen, one minute I am laughing, a few hours later I am crying, and then later I am screaming in anger, it is a great ride! Like I said before they are long, I would never have time to read them, only people who read really fast should read them because if you are a slow reader by the time you finish you will forget what happens in the begining, reading puts me to sleep so I have listen to them over and over again and pick up on something new every time.

"B000FC1HBY","5","Kings, Wildlings, and Dragons","I'm enjoying my return trip to Westerns. Unlike the first book, the second installment deviates a great deal from the TV series, or perhaps that's the other way around. This makes the book feel different even though I saw it all on HBO. There is so much going on in Clash of Kings that at times it's hard to narrow it down to the best parts. Robb Stark, the King in the North, has won several key battles against the Lannisters, but a betrayal by one he called brother could see his new nation crumble before it even begins. Meanwhile, Arya Stark, in what is possibly the best arc in the novel, goes from princess, to fugitive, to captive in the blink of an eye. Daenrys Targaryen struggles to lead her khalasar though the Red Wastes though news of her dragons brings help, and dangers, in the unlikeliest of guises. Back home in Winterfell, young Bran Stark does everything in his power to hold the North together while beyond the Wall his bastard brother, Jon Snow, is pushed beyond his physical and mental limits as he battles the Wildlings. Definitely the best of the series so far, I can't explain how happy I am that I decided to actually read the series, to let my own imagination decide the feel and outlook of Westeros and the magnificent world of Martin's.

Initially, I thought it would be more fun to not spoil the surprises and events of the TV, through reading the books, but now I think there is just too much downside. There is quite a lot of detail left out of the TV series, and in some cases they've really simplified what was going on; in particular at the end of the TV series I was plain confused as to why the place was on fire. After reading, I now know, and have a much better idea. Further, I think I'll actually enjoy the TV more for knowing what the full story is, and just going for the ride. Also, I felt I had to wade through the book a little as I basically knew what was going on more than the author intended, so I think it was a little spoiled from that point of view. Ah well. I now continue straight into A Storm of Swords before the new TV season starts in April. As for the actual novel, other than the above, I did really enjoy it. The language is beautiful, the detail amazing, and the depth fulfilling. Tyrion shines in the book as he does on TV.

There are a plethora of characters, from a plethora of families and global locations all with their own perspective and each eventually interacting. This book breaks the old fashioned Us vs Them mentality or We are the good guys and they are the bad guys. It switches between characters points of view (each chapter a different character) and you start to relate to with every one in their own way which blows my mind going from a character that I thought was ""evil"" to having him be one of my favorite characters (Tyrion). The series does have magic but it is so lightly sprinkled and barely acknowledged in the book, that it has the perfect presence with out making the story cheesy/lighthearted and easily solving diabolical problems.

A Song of Ice and Fire series starts with A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings comes after. I started watching the TV adaptation before reading these books and A Game of Thrones (book 1) was a great beginning to the series but was not as exciting to read since the show follows this book almost exactly. After season one and book one though, the stories, though similar, break off into different directions. It would be hard to put into words just how amazing this book is. I fell in love with the Harry Potter series as a teenager and as a result lost interest in reading because nothing could compare to the masterpiece that is Harry Potter (also I was young and starting college so joy reading was not on my to-do list.) That all changed when I met ASOIAF series. This series has made me fall in love with reading again.

I was recommended this series by my son and thus found myself reading 'Game of Thrones'. I found the setting of the series to be a little bit too raw and brutal compared to most of the books I normally enjoy reading, but I started my reading in the sixties last century. Things are a bit different these days. However George Martin presented the story lines well in an easy to read and organised manner. The reader isn't continually beaten up by ever increasing brutality. The stages are set, the myriad of characters and links between them are carefully laid out allowing the reader to get to know them as the story line slowly develops. His characters are especially well developed and all different and there are no shortages of them. Its a bit complicated initially but George manages to bring you into the intricate webs that have woven all over the place until you are firmly entangled in them. Book one whetted my appetite for book two which I found quite comfortable to read, especially the way in how the chapters are all set to each individual character.

"B000FC1HBY","5","Long setup for an AMAZING climax","At first, I thought A Clash Of Kings was a letdown after A Game Of Thrones -- it has even more characters and plot lines to keep track of, it starts aggravatingly slow, and it lacks some of the fun of its predecessor. But those are all part of Martin's masterstroke, which he carefully unfolds into a series of spectacular climaxes by the end. This book puts a lot of interest into the political maneuvering of the various rising powers in Westeros -- I loved that Tyrion's cunning gets plenty of time to shine. And the morality of most of these characters lands squarely in the grey region -- not all Lannisters are as bad as they seem, and not all of the Starks' allies are as noble as the late Ned Stark. This is a darker novel and world than its predecessor, no longer featuring mighty tournaments of knights, but full-blown wars and assassinations. And it's glorious. You will have to invest some patience for Martin to work his magic, but it's absolutely worth it. He shows off his versatility as an author, pulling off a helluva juggling act to depict a volatile political landscape. And as always, be wary of getting attached to characters.

"B000FC1HBY","5","A Non-Fantasy Fan (at least I used to be)","I always enjoyed the idea of an epic fantasy, where the author could create a world and characters that are much more in depth than in a normal novel, yet I never could really get into any enough to put the time in. I read the first Wheel of Time book and the first Dune book (Sci-Fi is close enough to fantasy), and enjoyed them both, but not enough to put my time into reading the rest of the series. But when I read A Game of Thrones, I was absolutely hooked. The day I finished it, I went out and got A Clash of Kings and read it more quickly than I've ever read a 1,000 page book. Both of these books are absolutely amazing. I'll let you get the reasons from other reviews (that's basically how I came upon the series), but I just wanted to say from the point of someone who is NOT a big fan of this genre, these are still some of the best books I have ever read. I can't wait for the next one to come out in paperback next month, so I can go get it! If you want to only read one series, THIS IS THE ONE!!! I haven't read as much as many people that will read this, but of the 40 or so books that I have read, this is the only one that I felt compelled to write a review on. Again, I don't want to reiterate all the good points of these books (and there are many), but I just wanted to say that I'm glad I finally found a fantasy series that is truly worth the time investment that they all take.","2002-04-14","United States","","true","74","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RC6XRXJHM6R"
"B000FC1HBY","5","A Clash of Kings","What can I say about ""A Clash of Kings"" that can allow you to know how good it is? I've read many series (Sci Fi, Fantasy, Detective to name a few) over the years, and George R.R. Martin's series ""A Song of Fire and Ice"" is definitely up there with all the greats. ""From the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding lands of Winterfell, chaos reigns as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms stake their claims through tempest, turmoil and war. As a prophecy of doom cuts across the sky - a comet the colour of blood and flame - five factions struggle for control of a divided land. Brother plots against brother and the dead rise to walk in the night. Against a backdrop of incest, fratricide, alchemy and murder, the price of glory is measured in blood."" This is an adult's story, there is no grossing over the battles, blood and gore and sex are very much part of George R.R. Martin's writing style. The Tyrion and Arya chapters are the best parts of the book (for me); that doesn't mean the other character's tales aren't good, just that these were exceptional and had me swiping the pages to know what happens. I started ""A Storm of Swords"" as soon as I finished ""A Clash of Kings"". I don't know why I haven't read this series before now. Definitely five stars.","2014-06-11","United States","","true","75","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B12CCXASVTEX"

On page 388 is the following sentence: ""He followed, angry, holding the torch out low so he could see the rocks that threatened to trip him with every step, the thick roots that seemed to grab as his feet, the holes where a man could twist an ankle."" Shouldn't that read ""to grab at his feet""? Pages 414-415 contain this sentence: ""Halfway to the brewhouse, as she passing under the stone bridge that arched between Widow's Tower and Kingspyre, she heard harsh, growling laughter."" Shouldn't that read ""as she was passing""? I just find it terribly distracting. In terms of content, I've enjoyed A Game of Thrones and this book, and plan to read the rest. They're interesting and sometimes exciting, but they lack the depth and resonance of Tolkien, to whom I've seen Martin compared numerous times. I am engaged with some of the characters (Arya, for example) while others are just cardboard to me (Theon, Catelyn). I also think that some of Martin's attempts to create a fantasy world are half-hearted and silly - as if changing the name Kevin to Kevan, or the word southern to southron, or the word Sir to Ser makes them more exotic.

Always searching for the next great read, my ex-husband started A Game of Thrones, loved George R. R.'s writing style, & convinced me that I would too. Needless to say (5+stars review), I did fall in love with this elaborate, epic tale. I found the various perspectives from the many characters to be a refreshing writing style, & ever since finishing the series (twice or thrice now), I just can't find anything to measure up to it...(I really hope that Mr. Martin gets the last two books out, & doesn't just let HBO finish weaving the tale together)... * all of that being said, when I finally picked A Game of Thrones up for the first time, I was looking to fill the ""reading void"" that the Lord of the Rings books, the Dune books, the Dune House books (all of the various Dune titles actually, Herbert's originals, plus Herbert's son & Kevin J. Anderson's collaborations), & the very many Stephen King books/series had left behind.... Holy shizzz did these not only FILL that void, but they also CREATED a void, as nothing has measured up to them since I first finished the series...(* the unfinished series ;'( )...

Like others, I got turned on the GOT books by the HBO series. I just finished reading Clash of Kings late last night. It's one of those books where you don't want to go to sleep because you want to read just one more chapter. Five hours later, you've lost another night's sleep. The author's writing style is so smooth that you just lose yourself in the story. This second book builds on the first book, which was also amazing. Where Book 1 set up a lot of the characters, Book 2 has a lot more action. The author does an amazing job of making you see each point of view. While reading the part about the big battle in the book, I couldn't decide which king I supported. Although King Joffrey is clearly a despicable character and you want him to lose, Tyrion is awesome and you want to root for him, which means you are also rooting for the despicable King Joffrey and the rest of the Lannister clan. Theon Greyjoy takes an unfortunate path, and you want to hate him, but he's so pathetic and his family has so much contempt for him, that I ended up feeling sorry for him. As you spend more time with each character, they become more fleshed out. I can't wait to see what happens to my favorite characters, and I hope they survive Book 3.","2011-08-26","United States","","true","78","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CVXC8U270PNY"
"B000FC1HBY","5","Better than the first","(***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST BOOK***) For some reason it seems that most liked this book less than the first. I must admit that I don't get it. The only reason that I can think of is that they were Ned Stark fans. The new characters are great. Davos, Melisandre, Stannis Baratheon and all the rest... We dive deeper into the religious world of ASoIaF. New religions are being introduced, and we learn more about the belief in the old gods and the new ones (The Seven). The characters we've come to know and love in the first book gain depth and it really feels like GRRM knows the people he writes about. The introduction of Theon Greyjoy, a neglectable character in the first book, as a viewpoint character is great. He is by far one of the most interesting additions. Tyrion Lannister and Arya Stark seems to become the center of focus in this book, and Ned's absence did not bother me at all. The plot revolves around the continuation of the war between the Starks and the Lannister, with the addition of the Baratheon brothers, each claiming the throne to himself. Daenerys Targaryen's journy continues after the birth of her dragons, and Jon Snow's adventures further broaden our knowledge on the world beyond the wall. After reading more than 2,000 pages I wanted to take a break from the ASoIaF universe, but after a few weeks I stopped reading whatever it was I was reading, and started the third book, anxious to learn what happens next. I truly enjoyed this book.","2012-05-09","United States","","true","79","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LXTT0BF46K68"

I bought the first 5 books and I'm almost done with book 2, but will hold off reading book 3 until Season 4 is over. Unlike Book 1 and Season 1 of Game of Thrones, in which the series closely follows the book, Season 2 only uses certain aspects of the Book 2. In Season 2, the story is compressed and many of the minor characters are eliminated, thus leaving out quite a bit of the store. I don't mind it because if you are a fan of the TV series, reading the book is like watching the same show with lengthy alternative scenes. The basic storyline is still there in the TV series, however in the book, the major and minor characters' roles are more fleshed out. What I like about the book is that it allows the reader to better understand the inner thoughts and motives of the main characters as they speak. Many of the TV characters' statements are taken verbatim from the book, which I like. I can't wait for George R R Martin to finish writing the next books so I could add them to my collection.

I like the construction of the books in this series--each chapter devoted to a single character's perspective of events. However, sometimes this book seemed too disconnected. I also had trouble keeping castles and secondary characters straight in my head. This is the wrong sort of book to read on a Kindle. I didn't find the genealogies of the various houses until I had completed the text. Had it been presented in the beginning, I might have had an easier time. I also needed maps. Thanks to what I am sure was copious research, the plot, although set in some other world a la Tolkien and Rowling, gives the reader a glimpse of the unsettled state of the Middle Ages on Earth. The books seem to carry as one theme relevant to the modern reader, ""The more things change, the more they remain the same."" Martin is a master at introducing red herrings and creating cliff-hanging situations. Obviously, I'm going to have to read the rest of the series to discover how it all comes out, but I will read subsequent books in the paper versions.","2014-03-28","United States","","true","81","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMC3DUUGLKCPQ"

The Song of Ice and Fire series is told third person past tense from multiple points of view with a cast of thousands. Brandon Sanderson’s Stormlight Archive series is the same way. The first three books in The Song of Ice and Fire series knocked my socks off, and I didn’t even read them until after I had seen the first two seasons of the Game of Thrones HBO series. Since then I’ve accumulated six hardcovers in the Westeros universe, and six seasons on disc. Only two seasons left of the TV show, thirteen episodes, and Game of Thrones is history. I’m already looking for my next favorite TV series. When I’m not watching episodic storytelling I’m reading, everything from nonfiction to westerns, but at least half of my time is spent reading sci-fi and fantasy.

Unlike how ""A Game of Thrones"" began, you know 90% of the characters and almost all of the major locations. The first book left readers off with a cliffhanger of the formation of alliances, kings, and hostages, with people ready to fight for the Iron Throne. Now, it's time for preparation, negotiations, and most of all, war, all in approximately 1,000 pages, if you somewhat include the appendix (which is amazing if you begin to forget the characters or their importance). Personally, I loved it better than the first because now that I'm adjusted to Martin's imagination and plot course, I can allow myself to expect or at least anticipate what might happen. We begin to see a more split up realm where people and families are separated, and everybody is essentially on their own. You never know who will die and who will survive, so keep that in mind when reading. At some points, you will begin to question whether or not whatever a character is doing is important to the plot. Most of the time, whatever people are doing, it's important. Maybe 2% of people's actions can be irrelevant, but try your best not to forget certain things because there are a lot of viewpoints in this story!

So it is with this in mind that I write this review to fans who are interested in what other fans think of the different books in the series. Well written and great moments abound in the sophomore outing for this series. It is good all the way threw. Then the last battle comes and knocks you out of the park. I find major battles in books problematic. Never once did I lose place of what was going on and what was at stake. One of the best chapters in the whole series so far comes toward the end when catelyn stark comes to terms with Jamie. That scene is everything this series strives to do. The complaints I have is it feels a little like stalling. Or maybe it is the strengths of the first and third that makes this entry just a tad quieter.

Often I feel like it is me walking the black watch and my feet are stuck with glue to the path. Lots of detail that I would just as soon skip over (and often do) to get to the next area of action. I will finish this saga nonetheless. It grows tiresome and one would frequently wish that the characters were a tad brighter intellectually than they are, and these religions are so vague that one has to wonder about the shallowness of the games they play. Reminds me often of House of Cards and the mindless games that are played out in both the parliaments and congresses of the world and even the Vatican and church politics that abound without much purpose other than to degrade the common man. If that is George Martin's purpose, then he is accomplishing it with bravado in this mythical tale of nothingness. Like life today, the game is so intense because the stakes are so low! Reminds me of a university!

"B000FC1HBY","3","ice and fire saga ... should ""blood"" be in there?","As I write this, I am 3 books through the 4 book series and will definitely read the 4th book (though I will borrow it from the library rather than buy it). I gave this book/series 3 stars ... does that seem credible as I devour the 3500+ pages of the series? I don't know, as I guess I am enjoying it ... These comments are really general ones about the series, as the books do not really individually stand out. The best thing about book 2 was that I got a larger paperback version than normal, which was easier for me to read and handle. Writing: On the plus side George R.R. Martin has created a detailed, fully imagined world, with at least 12 separate plot lines that he keeps going and intertwines as appropriate. Many of the characters have complex, conflicted motivations which he skillfully conveys. On the negative side: perhaps I have been reading ""young adult"" pablum fiction with my son for too long, but the unremitting level of violence in the series becomes fatiguing after a while (early on it is merely shocking). I have never read a work of fiction with this level of violence. In fact Martin uses a plot device where, every time there is a chance of resolution of some major plot issue, he kills off the main character who would be essential to the resolution. Since this happens 2 to 5 times in each book, I found this predictable and manipulative. Plus no plot line has reached any sort of resolution by the end of book 3. Good way to sell book 4, I guess. Another aspect that may be negative for some is the focus on complex relationships between the different ""houses"" in the novels. Each volume has 45+ pages of family tree information in an appendix in case you start to lose track of whose great grandson married whose cousin to forge an alliance between which houses. By the end of the first book I had stopped worrying about my inability to follow all these interactions. For me, the level of detail detracted from the plot. So where does that leave me, as a net out for the series? I think the books are a monumental achievement, but in kind of the same way I think Wikipedia is a monumental achievement. My conclusion, by the end of A Clash of Kings, which was then confirmed in book 3, was that there were actually 3 series contained in the one series. If Martin had produced a 12 book series, with each book more focused and with a more cohesive plot line, I think he would be viewed as a peer and equal of Tolkien or Asimov (albeit with far more ""adult"" content) as an author of an ageless series.","2007-07-24","United States","","true","89","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26VO7P6ZTE9A0"

The people of the North seek to break away and become an independent kingdom under the leadership of the Young Wolf, Robb Stark of Winterfell. This is a great story.

Even before I watch the second season, I understood the whole ""Where are my dragons?!"" thing. I would laugh if I knew how. And let us not forget Davos, the right-hand man of Stannis Baratheon.

And that is especially important when the book boasts nearly 1000 pages. The storyline is more complex this time, introducing two more characters that offer their point of view. There already is a cast of several dozens and I'll admit that it can get frustrating trying to remember who's who, but for that GRRM has an updated House Tree at the back, listing in orderly fashion who belongs to what House. Unlike the later Wheel of Time books, GRRM takes us to strange and foreign places without inundating us with every little custom and describing every bolt of cloth. He just puts out enough to make you feel like you're there and then gets back on track with the plot. It's fair to say that more events actually happen in this one book than in the past few Wheel of Time books. Just about every chapter ends with a bang. Sea battles, braving the cold northern regions, walking across deserts and finding deserted cities, politics, bold escapes, dark magics, secret passages, assassinations: If these are your cups of tea (or poison) then this book is for you and highly recommended.","2007-06-09","United States","","true","96","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QPU67S7SIWQA"

The depth of characterisation, the scope of the tale, the range of peoples, houses and alliances all make for a complex and thrilling read. This book develops more in the region of sorcery than the original. Old magics are awakening, and I just hope that they don't grow to dominate the series. I prefer the Sword to the Sorcery in these stories. If there was any other disappointment for me it was in the failure of grand battles to materialise. I don't think Martin has the knack of being able to describe the grand movements of military hosts. His largest canvas was a huge naval battle, and it quickly became a confusing parade of ships names and uncertain outcomes. Disappointments aside, the plot continues to thicken nicely and I will buy the third installment. However, I do not want to see another Robert Jordan series (wheel of time is into book what?....9 or 10?). I do not intend to pay for Mr Martins retirement, so if conclusions are not being alluded to by book three I may take my custom elsewhere.","2001-08-02","United States","","true","97","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27Y8D2X5LLQ3M"

Otherewise, the plot line and in depth stories keep you on your toes. Martin is a gifted and detailed writer. You care about the characters and the world they inhabit. I'm normally not a science fiction or fantasy reader, but I got hooked on the series (THE SERIES IS PHENOMENAL!). Both the book and series are excellent, and that is a rarity. This is a note for parents who have kids that want to read the books: Martin's books are not as graphic as the series. The characters are truly compelling, as they face different obstacles due to either physical deformities or gender based prejudices.

Whether it was the PAWN OF PROPHECY or even way back with THE BOOK OF THREE, certain (and very few) books have had the power to enrapture me. For a time, I thought that Jordan's or Goodwin's books could, but they somehow left me wanting. GRRM's latest two books, however, have caught me in their snare. This book was an excellent portrayal of an extremely realistic world. Though almost entirely devoid of magic, there is a sense of pending release that few books (in any genre) have captured. I will admit that there are many characters and that often you are left wanting more depth with some. However, unlike Jordan's latest book, I actually feel like these characters are progressing somewhere...growing, expanding, or falling deeper into their pit of doom. While there are no clear protaganists, it is clear that each reader will have their favorite (or most hated) characters to grab a hold of and not let go. One final note. Whether it is an epic fantasy series or an epic science fiction movie series (read: Star Wars), readers and viewers tend to take, for some unknown reason, a sense of ownership in the stories that they read. It is important to remember that this is Martin's story and he has been kind enough to let us in to share in his world.

"B000FC1HBY","5","The Intrigue Continues","In short, if you loved A Game of Thrones you will love A Clash of Kings, and by the same token if you weren't such a fan of A Game of Thrones, this book probably won't grab you either, but it could. Whereas A Game of Thrones focused more on the political intrigue and ended with omens of war, this book starts and ends with the war raging. I found the story becomes more complicated, as we hear more about Stannis Baratheon (who spent all of the last book in Dragonstone, away from the main conflict) and more and more people join the struggle for the Iron Throne. If you were a huge fan of Danaerys Targaryen's story, you might be disappointed, as I found her story to be both short and a little confusing, but it had enough substance to hold my interest, and it ends with the promise of more action in the next book. I kind of wished it had tied up some storylines, but of course this is second in a series of five, so it makes sense that a lot of storylines and even parts of storylines remain open. Another masterpiece that continues what I consider to be one of the best series I've read in a while and definitely worth reading if the first book interests you at all. The final 100 or so pages especially are one of the more epic scenes in the series so far.","2012-02-06","United States","","true","100","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PG6RK6ZD67Z5"
