"B000FCKGPC","5","Compelling Political Intrigue","Expectations were without a doubt going to be high coming off of what many people (including myself) considered to be the best novel in the series: A Storm of Swords. Perhaps the expectations were impossibly high. Too high for any author to meet, including George Martin. With some of the decisions that Martin had to make for this book to come out at all, there was likely to be some vocal backlash from certain fans. (In an attempt to not regurgitate a summary of A Feast for Crows, which many of people have already done. I will focus on how the novel compares to previous books, and try and quell reader's fears.) The problem proved to be what most people predicted at the end of A Storm of Swords: the series got too damn big. Although there are many fantasy series out there with more books in them. I mean look at Robert Jordan, his novels have managed to span fourteen volumes, not including the prequel novel, and a companion book. I'm pretty certain that he is in large part the reason for deforestation. Not to mention the likes of Piers Anthony (whom I am very fond of) and select other authors who don't seem to understand the word ""ending"". However, unlike many other fantasy authors that seem to fill half of the novels with mere bloating tactics, while their ongoing plot arches are paper-thin and miles wide. Martin develops A Song of Ice and Fire, with a scope that is unmatched by any author. If you want depth, you're looking at the Mariana trench of fantasy sagas. It is safe to say that A Song of Ice and Fire didn't just raise fantasy's literary bar, it became the standard for which everyone else must try and match. With A Feast for Crows, Martin found himself faced with the insurmountable odds of tying in characters and story lines, which after half a decade of buildup, ended up with him cutting it in half. The unfinished storylines and their characters were simply held off until the next book in the series, A Dance with Dragons. Feast's length is closer to that of A Game of Thrones than Storm, which might make some people disappointed after such a long wait. But I think it was a better choice for the story - or to put it more aptly, this installment of the story. Considering that Feast was originally supposed to be two times longer, its most impressive quality is that it flows so smoothly together, and how concise the narrative remains. As the story opens, the reader is introduced with a flurry of new characters (a necessary device, considering that most of the characters from the first three novels are now dead), some minor characters are now prominent figures, and several chapters that detail the relative calm across the land following the calamity of war. The best part, for me anyways, is that some of the new point of view characters recap key plots that may have slipped many readers' minds over the series. Some readers might be disappointed that we don't see much of the bloody and violent action of previous volumes in Feast. There is a lot of exposition, as Martin has to bring us up speed on not only characters we remember, but also on the new ones he's introducing. Martin obviously has a skill for worldcraft with compelling storytelling that remains virtually unchallenged in fantasy, but it also comes with, what many consider a down side. Many of the characters have lengthy discussions of politics, both present and historical. Like I said, many people believe this to be the worst part of the book. However, I felt that it was the most interesting. There is something to be said for the level of painstaking detail of history that Martin placed into his novel. If A Feast for Crows is only a transitional volume in this gigantic saga, it is still a story told with as much passion and humanity as Martin has brought to any previous volume. And it adds much detail and texture to an already rich and layered world. The choices of what to cut and what to hold back obviously were not easy ones, considering the book's long and frustrating gestation. But readers who have managed to avoid building up unrealistic expectations will find that Martin has brought his story to a necessary, believable, and appropriate pass. In the aftermath of catastrophic war, in the endless, vain and violent quest for power and more power, no matter whose banners are flying at the end of the day, there are no real winners. Except the crows. Five Stars P.S. I know that many people have written about how you could skip the Cersei chapters. DO NOT DO SO!!! You would be doing yourself a great disservice. She is without a doubt the most interesting character in this particular novel.","2013-07-30","United States","","true","1","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4P6NQ2L91CBK"
"B000FCKGPC","5","The most divisive book in the series is still a worthy part in it.","A Feast for Crows is likely the most divisive part of the ongoing A Song of Ice and Fire series of books. In developing the sequel to the widely loved A Storm of Swords, George R.R. Martin realized that he wouldn't be able to do the five-year time skip he originally envisioned because there was just too much plot in this deep series. However, because he wanted the fourth book to be shorter than A Storm of Swords (which was the longest book yet, an accomplishment of its own given the door-stopper length of these books), the fourth book in the series would need to be split into two more: A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons. Each needed its own complete story, though, so George R.R. Martin decided to split the plot of the books on geographic location: A Feast for Crows would follow King's Landing and the Riverlands, while A Dance with Dragons would follow the North and across the sea in Essos. This meant that each book would have different point of view characters, and many of the fan favorites ended up in A Dance with Dragons, such as Tyrion, Danaerys, and Jon. However, although some of the fan favorite characters are missing, A Feast for Crows is still definitely an entry in this amazing series, and a worthy one at that. A Feast for Crows follows directly from the end of A Storm of Swords and follows many point of view characters on the south end of Westeros as the War of the Five Kings winds down. Cersei and Jaime are dealing with the loss of their father and taking care of the kingdom, Brienne is sent through the Riverlands to search for Sansa Stark, the Iron Islands lose their king and must find a new one, and Prince Doran in Dorne is also dealing with the loss of his brother in the events of the prior book while other machinations are occurring under his nose. With the expansion to Dorne and more detail in the Iron Islands, a large amount of new point of view characters are brought into play in those areas, though most take up only one or two chapters. Other recurring characters like Cersei and Brienne are now given their own chapters as well, further developing their characters. The plot moves forward in its own way, though it is apparent that this is a middle book. There are no big twists like previous books (the big death of the first book or the Red Wedding of the third), and the plot does often feel like build-up. However, those who enjoy the characters of the series will still enjoy their arcs over the course of the book, while the latter act of the book does build up to some thrilling final chapters that set up the forward progression of the series nicely. Where A Feast for Crow proves that it is still a worthy member of the series, even if not the best, is its characters: they are still deep and wonderfully written. A vast amount of characters exist in this book, but all of them are rich and believable, from point of view characters to side characters like Robert Arryn, Genna Lannister, or Septon Meribald. The point of view characters are well-developed, often in ways that give us new insight into their characters. For example, we get a better idea of Brienne's upbringing and life back home, and we finally learn what goes on in Cersei's head as she rules the kingdom. Cersei is a highlight of the book, not just because she has the most chapters, but because we learn a new perspective on her and learn why she is the way she is, but in a way that still takes care to keep her as unlikable as ever, if not more so. Character interactions and relationships are also still strong, especially the growth of Jaime and the way his relationship with Cersei develops, or breaks, over the course of the book. The deep characters are one of the series' greatest strengths, and that doesn't change here. Another of the series' strengths is strong writing and excellent world building, and both are here. A Feast for Crows continues to have well-written dialogue. Martin is a master at crafting wonderful monologues that hit hard and scenes that close out a chapter leaving us wanting more (only to have to wait until the next chapter from that character). The prose is great as well, whether it is describing drool-inducing meals, gorgeous fashion, or imaginative locations. The world of A Song of Ice and Fire is rich in a way that takes the best cues from Tolkien, but understands what it was that made Middle-earth such a beautiful setting without just cloning Middle-earth. We get new developments about Westerosi culture, from Dorne to the Iron Islands, and even a little bit across the Narrow Sea. This cultural development also continues the intelligent themes and motifs of the series while focusing on some new ones. A Feast for Crows delves into how a medieval society treats women and the roles it puts them, religion, the mystery of magic, and the ever-present politics in ruling a kingdom (""the game of thrones""). This is a hard book to rate and review, because many may still have different feelings. Mechanically, the pieces are still there, the characters and the world are still well developed in a truly Martin way. However, the absence of characters like Tyrion, Jon, and Danaerys and lack of or minimal progression on some of the overarching story lines of the series (such as the Wall or Danaerys' journey back to Westeros) may leave this book as ""that one you have to get through"" for some readers. However, those willing to wait for those characters, and take in this book as it is, will still find a book that is definitely a part of the series and well worth a read.","2015-12-12","United States","","true","2","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S6C9XU8MF0H9"
"B000FCKGPC","4","Good of its own right","As most people reading this review are probably aware, there is a lot of controversy surrounding this book. While the first three volumes of Martin's saga are almost universally praised, this latest (ha! Latest, and released now five years ago) volume is treated as Martin's bastard child, many wishing it had never existed, or that it had more of what they wanted, or wishing they had never read the series to begin with. It's easy to understand where this frustration comes from. For one thing, the direction of the story completely veers off, and the cast of characters is radically different. If one had picked up the story without expecting that, I could see how it would be frustrating. Compound that with the fact that Martin said he would give us the rest of the story FOUR YEARS AGO, and still hasn't, and it's easy to see why many fans would be frustrated. But the reality is that both of these circumstances are tangential, they have nothing to do with the merits of this book. And when I try to be objective, I find the plot and the characters still interesting and worthy of acclaim. Having said that though, I would still say this is the worst of the four books in the series. This isn't a criticism of the book itself, but more of a realistic recognition of what it is and where it is. It's often looked on as a continuation of the first three, but I think it is more properly considered as the epilogue to the first three book series, and the introduction to whatever is coming now. Storm of Swords was the best of the series so far, but that's because it was climactic, and climax is riveting. Many of the conflicts introduced in the early series were resolved in that volume, and new ones were only just set up for Feast for Crows. As such, FfC is an introductory volume, and is best compared to Game of Thrones, to which it is only slightly inferior. Many of the storylines of Feast for Crows are interesting and compelling. Of foremost interest to me is Sansa and Littlefinger, the latter of which has revealed himself to be a true master schemer, who now is a great source of anticipation, and will doubtlessly be a majorly interesting plot mover. Samwell Tarly and Arya Stark are also characters whose circumstances have changed, and whose stories are of great interest. And most importantly, there are two new storylines which I find fascinating, about settings with rich backgrounds, which so far in the series we've heard little about. These are Dorne and the Iron Islands. Dorne is especially enchanting. The primary character of the book, though, is Cersei Lannister. That Martin made her such a central figure in this volume is a real break with the earlier series, in that she's the first point of view character to be eminently loatheable. All of the other point of view characters have been loveable, likeable, or at the very least, sympathetic. When Martin made Jaime a POV character in Storm of Swords, I was skeptical for the same reason, but he made Jaime a great character, and he grows even more in this volume. He's now one of my favorites. But Cersei is none of that. She may be Jaime's twin, but of course, they're not identical. I hated her with every word I read of her. She's pure evil. The only way to enjoy her story was to hope that she eventually would destroy herself, and it would be oh so sweet. In that vein, it's enjoyable. Having said all that praise, though, there are points of the book that are less satisfying. There are characters who carry on pointless, rambling quests with no satisfying end. There are intriguing introductory scenes that are not stoked into interesting plot points. The prologue comes to mind in that regard. But these negatives don't render the book deserving of all the maligns it has received. One last word about the whole Martin situation, to anybody who's interested in the my opinion. I say be patient with Martin. This has been a great series. The only unforgiveable sin would be for him to publish A Dance With Dragons, and it not to live up to the series. That would be terrible. Think of Harry Potter, an inferior literary series, but still an epic. The first volumes, were good, but in the end, it was clear that the product suffered for the sake of the deadline. The result? That series won't stand the test of time as well as if they were written to perfection and it had taken longer. Think of Tolkien. To his credit, he published The Return of the King within a year of The Two Towers, and it was great. But ponder two hypotheticals. What if he had published it in that timeframe, and it was lackluster? What if he had published what he had, but 5 years later? Which would be worse? That was now 55 years ago, and while a delay may have annoyed his fans at the time, it would now be just a footnote to the literary historian. His legacy would be the books, and they would be just as great, just as Martin's will be. So take as much time as you need George, just so long as your next volumes are as great as your first four. We'll be waiting.","2010-06-05","United States","","true","3","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NUFGRFTJ8XSE"
"B000FCKGPC","5","This continues to be like no other series...","Wow, after reading some of the negative reviews of this book (let's call it book number 4A), I was a bit worried. But a needless worry, there is little discernable lettup of quality in this book from the first 3. To be sure, there are not quite the number of seismic events within the timeframe (I'm guessing about 8 months) written about in ""A Feast for Crows"", but rest assured, there are NOT very many new characters introduced (other than the obligitory references to scores of relationships and relatives!); and the plot is not meandering at all. A Feast for Crows largely tells tales of minor skirmishes and political intrigue that follow the extensive wars that comprised the second and third books. Perhaps the nay-sayers simply are not impressed when there isn't a steady diet of death and destruction or nonstop action? Martin keeps the focus over the story's timeframe to 6 major characters: Brienne, Jaime, Cersie, Sansa, Arya and Samwell; introduces a few characters to flesh out the political climate of the southern land of Dorne (curious about the Red Viper's home?) and describes the ongoing saga of the Ironborn as they seek to infiltrate their way into the mainland. It seems to me that this is a plenty big, but scarcely new, canvas of storylines to keep track of. I appreciated the limited scope of the book to these storylines; many times as I read the first three books, I would skip several story lines to follow the evolution of one or two of the characters before going back again. This is a perfectly logical approach to the story telling as there is very little physical interaction between the characters in this book versus those to come in the next. Martin's choice to segregate the 4th book into books 4A and 4B isn't the least bit distracting if you can put the other characters on hold in your mind (which you have to do in any book, just for not quite as long a period of time). Within the six major characters storylines, we get (amoungst other things): - An update on the doings of the Westro's most clever (and extremely honorable, in his own way) player, Littlefinger as Sansa's ""father"". As with most of Martin's characters, Petyr Baelish comes in various shades of grey; readers are afforded a chance to draw their own conclusions as to just how grey... - A momentary look at Catelyn revived (for better or worse!) in Brienne's story - A momentary look at Jon who sends Sam and Maester Aemon on a mission - The releationship of Cersei's son and daughter-in-law; and the administration for the Iron Throne done Cersei's way Several storylines are making a direct beeline for Dany, and it's too early to tell where Brienne will end, so I think it pre-mature to criticize the editing until more has played out. Thus far, I haven't seen any storyline drift into irrelevance so I have no reason to not be optimistic... As for those who liken this release to the crumbled messes that became Jordan's WOT (somewhat revived in KoD), or to a lesser degree Goodkind's SOT, give it a rest! Complain all you want about the lack of action, but the details and pace (reasonably fast for my tastes) of the story are well justified for those readers who are curious about characters and cultures of all of the major kingdoms and how they are reacting to the events of their time. There are no endless fussings over fashions, no endless repetitions of mannerisms, no 200 pages to cover the day in the life of one character (apparently there are those who actually like such ramblings in the WOT world?), no endlessly immature characterizations, no repetative philisophical oratories; the focus remains mainly on the fully adult characters or the evolution of the younger characters that we already know and how they are coping with the aftermath of the preceding books. The few new characters introduced by Martin are reasonably described according to the depth of their impact on the story. My only minor quibble with the book is that for the first time we end with a couple of cliffhangers of an immediate kind; prior to this book, Martin did a pretty good job of leaving off at places that were intriguing, but not in the middle of a life and death situation. Hopefully, these will be resolved as part of Book 4B -- I think it's a bit unreasonable to have to wait for more than a year to see whether or not a couple of the specific main characters live or die. In summary, if you enjoy the way Martin has richly developed his characters and story, and don't mind the reality that most people DON'T change that much (except, of course, for the younger characters who are evolving in ways that might surprise), and don't mind that you'll have to wait until next year to read about Danys, Jon, Tyrion and Stannis, amoungst others, you'll find much to deeply appreciate in this effort.","2005-12-12","United States","","true","4","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BGBENV20VBLZ"
"B000FCKGPC","5","Contrary to popular belief, this is a great book!","A Feast for Crows picks up where A Storm of Swords leaves off, and the events run concurrently with the next book, A Dance with Dragons. As usual with the Song of Ice and Fire books, George R.R. Martin’s great use of multiple POV’s weaves a grim tale set within the tumultuous lands of Westeros and Essos. No chapters for Jon, Tyrion, and Daenerys in this one. The story follows the points of view from Cersei, Brienne, Jamie, Sansa, Arya, Asha, Sam, Littlefinger, and more. Brienne of Tarth on her search for Sansa, and Arya’s voyage to Braavos to find the Many-Faced God are some of the best chapters here. Victarion Greyjoy, younger brother of Balon Greyjoy, and Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet, has been mentioned several times throughout the series. He makes his POV debut in A Feast for Crows, and reportedly has a POV in The Winds of Winter. I hope so. This is my favorite chapter, and I'm curious about his role in the next book. A Feast for Crows can be a slow-burn at times. It is a hefty book with 753 pages, appendixes included. But don’t worry, Martin’s masterful storytelling and character development will hook you in. Characters to get invested in, only to be killed off later, is part of the charm. You know it is coming, but it still shocks you when it happens. People say this is the worst book in the series, and I think they are out of their minds. But seriously, everyone is entitled to their opinion, and I can see why, with everybody's favorite trio of Jon, Tyrion, and Daenerys, especially Tyrion for me, not leading the way. Brienne, Jamie, and Arya’s character arcs are some of the best in the entire series. All in all, a great book and a must-have for the diehard!","2025-04-29","United States","","true","5","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M5CIKXVHG61S"
"B000FCKGPC","3","Good-ish story, not the writing you'd expect","The story is interesting. Not sure it needed to be so long for the very little it progressed overall, though. I am willing to forgive Martin for that because his writing is usually amazing. But boy, was I let down in that regard. One of my biggest pet peeves about lesser writers has plagued Martin this time around: frequent use of new vocabulary, like a new toy. I like new vocabulary, but it seems as though he'd find a new word and then use it several times in the same chapter rather than sprinkling it throughout the book. That gets obvious, like a kid trying to write an adult-sounding essay. It jolted me out of the story every time. I noticed it a few times in the other books, but this was over the top. If you're a picky-word reader, you've been warned. But you will pick up some new fancy-pants words. I felt there was a real shift in this book in a lot of ways. The dialogue and language seemed more stylized, for no reason that I could fathom. Many, MANY more characters we never really meet are brought up. I'm glad you made a family tree for that obscure bunch of people, but if it doesn't change the plot or a character's motivations, I don't care that much. Also, much more vulgarity, often for no apparent reason. If it's integral to the story, fine, otherwise it seems like sensationalism in order to sell books. Also, all of a sudden there are many ""mysterious"" things. Ooooo, set it up and tell me more. Or not. Because he didn't. Some of the characters appear to have undergone a complete personality change between books. Jaime's you can probably justify to me, but Cersei's is way off the charts. And what's with this prophecy? For something that supposedly shaped her as a person, it seems odd to just be bringing it up now. It felt like a plot device rather than a part of the character. I found the Cersei chapters hard to read since they just didn't make any sense in the context of what we already know about her. Toward the end it got extreme. I don't even love to hate her any more, it's just not fun. Cersei's personality transformation happens off stage, so some of her behavior doesn't make sense. We don't get to go on the journey despite the number of pages she takes up. Sansa, just not realistic. The whole play-acting thing was very juvenile, even for a juvenile. Either he wants us to believe that Sansa doesn't have much in the brains department or that girls in general can't pretend to be one thing while keeping their original identity intact. Same goes for Arya, but it wasn't done as obnoxiously forcefully. I am also a little tired of reading about how cheated the women in the book feel about the hand they've been dealt. Martin had better come up with a kick-butt female story line after all the setting up or I will have wasted reading hundreds of words about it. I get it, it stinks being a woman in that kind of society. How about a little more show and a little less tell? The internal whining made me want to tell them to suck it up or fix it. Note to Martin: women don't really whine that much to themselves in their heads. The pity party doesn't go on for that long in real life. Maybe the women rule in the next book, but I don't care as long as they don't whine about it. There were some high points. Samwell Tarly, for one. I could read a whole book about that oaf, though he's got to stop being so clueless. Life comes with lessons, and he seems immune to learning from his experiences. I enjoyed some of Arya's story, too. Brienne was interesting when she wasn't internally whining. I know other people complain about the detail that Martin usually gives to clothing and food, but I missed the food. Yes, I know food is harder to come by now and everyone's dirty and tired. I didn't realize how much I liked the food descriptions until they were gone! I would love to see the publisher add a small map of the area or a little link in the text to the map when places are mentioned, at least the first time in a chapter. When you read a physical book you can flip back and forth. When you read a digital book it's a pain if it's not linked. Since the stories are spread all over the place geographically, a little link love would be nice. I finally decided I could do without knowing where these things were taking place. I'll look it up later if it seems like it's important. All of this said, I do intend to read the next book. And the one after that, until the end. Unlike another large fantasy series that shall remain unnamed, I have hopeful confidence that Martin will bring his A-game to the final volumes. I pray for his continued good health, and that he doesn't find any new words to abuse repeatedly.","2012-10-19","United States","","true","6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ8BNZJ8P8UQB"
"B000FCKGPC","5","Another great, though different, chapter in the story","After finishing Book 3, Storm of Swords, I was emotionally drained. So much happens in such a short time to characters you care about. When I flipped through Book 4 to browse the chapter headings, I was worried. No Tyrion, no Danaerys, no Jon Snow, no Bran. That was troubling. But there are a number of reasons I ended up loving this installment. To start, I think the pace needed to slow down from the first three books. This is the lull before the storm that is clearly coming when Danaerys makes her way to Westeros. I think what Martin is trying to do is to show us the entire world he's created. Not just House Stark and Lannister and Targaeryon. I wouldn't want the story to come to completion without understanding as much of the world as I could. Of course, that only works if you find the characters he creates interesting and compelling. Obviously, a lot of reviewers (amateur and professional) didn't. But I did. I loved learning more about Dorne, getting to know Arianne and Prince Doran, getting more of the Iron Islanders, those sick, Drowned-God-loving lunatics. I was captivated by Arya's journey in Braavos, as well as Sam's odyssey and Brienne's. For some reason, I just enjoy the characters Martin creates--and he creates a lot of them. But each time I think, ""Oh, no, not another new character,"" I become enthralled with their story. The thing about the people Martin creates is they don't always do what you'd like them to do, but they always do what their character demands. Some grow, and some don't. And I found the chapters from Cersei's point of view fantastic. I mean, holy cow, she's got some issues. And her comeuppance is sweet (although I keep suspecting, of course, that the Frog's prophesy is really about Danaerys and not Margaery). If you didn't enjoy reading the Cersei chapters, I don't know what to tell you. At the same time, I found Jaime's growth--and growing disaffection from Cersei--to be just as compelling. One other thing that I think Martin is trying to do in Book 4 is to show, after the vicarious thrills of battle depicted in the first three books, the true cost of war. The author was (I believe) a conscientious objector during Vietnam, and I think he's trying to sober us up a little bit to the realities of what this conflict has wrought throughout the realm. The slaughter of innocents during wartime is not a 20th-century innovation. Anyone who's read anything about the 100 Years' War can't help but pick up on the similarities (the rape, pillage, and burning; the roving bands of brigands threatening anyone in their path, even entire towns; the complete descent into lawlessness; the common people resorting to religious fanaticism, etc.). Some of Brienne's experiences on the road and the people she meets along the way beautifully illustrate that. Having said that, I can understand why so many people have dismissed this book. (If you look at the Amazon reviews for Books 1-3, they're about 95% five stars. Books 4 and 5 are split evenly between one, two, three, four, and five stars.) All I can say is that, if your expectation for Book 4 is another installment just like Book 3, this will disappoint you. As for me, even though some of my favorite characters from the first three books were absent, I still loved this book. I know we'll get back to Tyrion and Danaerys, etc., so I wasn't worried and just enjoyed the journey. Also, I appreciated the slowing down of the pace and learning a lot more about the history and mythology of Westeros and the east. As for the complaints that much of the narrative is unnecessary, I'm a little perplexed. If you didn't get that Dorne is going to play a huge role in the coming conflict, you need to reread those chapters. Same goes for Victarion Greyjoy. And no doubt Brienne and Jaime's relationship will play a crucial role as their paths are bound to intersect again. If you don't like reading all that detail, I guess you could just wait for season 4 of the HBO series. I plan on enjoying both, because even a TV series as great as Game of Thrones can't convey what the books can (and do). For me, I thoroughly enjoyed A Feast for Crows and can't wait to start A Dance with Dragons.","2011-08-29","United States","","true","7","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29MMJW3Y83D7L"
"B000FCKGPC","4","CONTROVERSIAL BOOK OF ICE AND FIRE","Whew, this is a tough book to review simply because it doesn't follow on the expectations of the readers after A STORM OF SWORDS. Now some people are already saying that the book is horrible and a great letdown and others go to the other extreme and hold faithfully that it's just as good as the previous books. I don't feel either take is fair or accurate. To be fair, yes, the book doesn't move like the previous books, especially a STORM OF SWORDS. There are simply not the same level of WHAM BAM big moments nor shocking realizations (i.e. who killed Jon Arryn?). Additionally, some of the favorite characters of readers, like Jon, Dany and Tyrion, are not in this novel. Lastly, there are two new main POVs so we need to adjust to those. BTW, since other readers are spoiling the mystery POVs, did most of you notice that Brienne is apparently a descendant of Dunk from THE HEDGE KNIGHT. Pretty kewl. :) Getting back to the debate, remember that: (1) This is only half of a mega-sized book. GRRM is putting out only half of it and the other half is going to be in the next book. So, in essence, for those complaining he's taking too long, this is like four books as the average novel is 400 pages. Additionally, remember the guy has been writing for something like 30 + years and he's finally getting national acclaim. He has been asked to write scripts to some of his old novels, there's a game based on his series that he looked over, he's also gone over the HEDGE KNIGHT comic strip, he's written two novelettes on the hedge knight, hes been asked to attend dozens upon dozens of readings at various book/convention events (and, most recently, the prestigious one in D.C. where he was asked to give a long speech), he tends to answer the emails he gets from everyone which is in the thousands, he taught at the Odyssey program for about six weeks back east, etc. Most of these in the last two years. So, bully for him as he's getting more acknowledgements but keep in mind the guy has said he can't write except back in New Mexico. Things are going to go slower; and (2) While several of the POVs don't have resolutions, also keep in mind that they may show up in the next book with all those WHAM BAM moments everyone is seeking. Additionally, it probably isn't fair to view this as a stand alone simply because book four and five are like one book. The reason he broke it up, per his webpage at [...], is that his publishers demanded he get it out. For all we know, book four may be the midpoint of the story and book five is going to have a lot of climaxes. AFFC is really a come down from several climaxes. As the dust settles, lots of information is shared. There's a great deal of focus on characters. Lots and lots of characters, even if fleeting. As a result, not as much seems to happen. To some, this might be seen as meanderings, and, well, yes, some of it probably is. lol For those who want to know more about the world, here's your chance. Just don't expect it to be like ASOS. I remember several complaints by earlier reviewers of previous books that there wasn't enough about context and almost nothing about the religion of the times. People complained that one would think the religion would have a greater impact and political power base than shown in the last three books. Well, you get it in this book. Big time. Another thing to keep in mind: there are probably about 35-50% more character POVs simply because there are several small focuses on various characters all over the globe. We get a lot of focus on Dorne and the Iron Isles as well as King's Landing. There are sprinklings in other areas, too, like Oldtown and where Brienne travels (i.e. don't want to spoil it so I won't say where). As result, these characters slows the story down from having big moments because there's more to tell. While I get this is probably the least popular book of the four, assuming we were to take a tally, I still feel GRRM is the best living fantasy author out there if you want tales that don't overuse archetypes and have complex characters and plots. I challenge anyone to email me to suggest a better author. On that note, for people who haven't read the previous books, here's why GRRM is a superb writer from my previous review on ASOS: First off, I'm a heavy duty fan of GRRM. I've read over a 100 different fantasy authors in my time (started at 12; I'm now 32). Took about 5 years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic and cliched. Typical archetype character who turns out to be the missing heir or boy wonder who saves the world against the Dark Lord. So, when I came back to fantasy at the end of 1999, I read the usual: Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then someone told me about GRRM and man, that was the kicker! Here are the reasons to choose GRRM. I've also listed the reasons not to choose him to make it fair b/c I know their are certain personalities who won't like this series: WHY TO READ GRRM (1) YOU ARE TIRED OF FORMULAIC FANTASY: good lad beats the dark lord against impossible odds; boy is the epitome of good; he and all his friends never die even though they go through great dangers . . . the good and noble king; the beautiful princess who falls in love with the commoner boy even though their stations are drastically different . . . the dark lord is very evil and almost one sided at times . . . you get the idea. After reading this over and over, it gets old. (2) YOU ARE TIRED OF ALL THE HEROES STAYING ALIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDER CONSTANT DANGER: this gets even worse where the author kills a main hero off but that person comes back later in the story. Or, a hero does die but magic brings him back. This sometimes carries to minor characters where even they may not die, but most fantasy authors like to kill them off to show that some risked the adventure and perished. (3) YOU ARE A MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFF: this story was influenced by the WARS OF THE ROSES and THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR. (4) YOU LOVE SERIOUS INTRIGUE WITHOUT STUPID OPPONENTS: lots of layering; lots of intrigue; lots of clever players in the game of thrones. Unlike other fantasy novels, one side, usually the villain, is stupid or not too bright. (5) YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BIASED OPINIONS AND DIFFERENT TRUTHS: GRRM has set this up where each chapter has the title of one character and the whole chapter is through their viewpoint. Interesting tidbit is that you get their perception of events or truths. But, if you pay attention, someone else will mention a different angle of truth in the story that we rarely see in other novels. Lastly and most importantly, GRRM doesn't try to tell us which person is right in their perception. He purposelly leaves it vague so that we are kept guessing. (6) LEGENDS: some of the most interesting characters are those who are long gone or dead. We never get the entire story but only bits and pieces; something that other fantasy authors could learn from to heighten suspense. Additionally, b/c the points of views are not congruent, we sometimes get different opinions. (7) WORDPLAY: if you're big on metaphors and description, GRRM is your guy. Almost flawless flow. (8) LOTS OF CONFLICT: all types, too; not just fighting but between characters through threats and intrigue. (9) MULTILAYERED PLOTTING; SUB PLOTS GALORE: each character has their own separate storyline; especially as the story continues and everyone gets scattered. This is one of the reasons why each novel is between 700-900 pages. (10) SUPERLATIVE VARIED CHARACTERS: not the typical archetypes that we are used to in most fantasy; some are gritty; few are totally evil or good; GRRM does a great job of changing our opinions of characters as the series progress. This is especially true of Jaime in book three. (11) REALISTIC MEDIEVAL DIALOGUE: not to the point that we can't understand it but well done. (12) HEAPS OF SYMOBLISM AND PROPHECY: if you're big on that. (13) EXCELLENT MYSTERIES: very hard to figure out the culprits; GRRM must have read a lot of mystery novels. (14) RICHLY TEXTURED FEMALE CHARACTERS: best male author on female characters I have read; realistic on how women think, too. (15) LOW MAGIC WORLD: magic is low key; not over the top so heroes can't get out of jams with it. REASON TO NOT READ GRRM (1) YOU LIKE YOUR MAIN CHARACTERS: GRRM does a good job of creating more likeable characters after a few die. But, if that isn't your style, you shouldn't be reading it. He kills off several, not just one, so be warned. (2) DO NOT CARE FOR GRITTY GRAY CHARACTERS: if you like more white and gray characters, this may unsettle you. I suggest Feist or Goodkind or Dragonlance if you want a more straight forward story with strong archetypes. (3) MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEWS TURN YOU OFF: if you prefer that the POVS only go to a few characters, this might be confusing for you. (4) SWEARING, SEX: there's a lot of it in this book just as there is in real life. If you have delicate ears, this book may upset you. (5) YOU DEMAND CLOSURE AT THE END OF EVERY BOOK: this isn't the case for all stories in the series. Some are still going on; some have been resolved; others have been created and are moving on. (6) IF YOU WANT A TARGET OR SOMEONE TO BLAME: this can be done to some extent but not as much. This is b/c he doesn't try to make anyone necessarily good or evil. (7) ARCHETYPES: some readers like archetypal characters because it's comfortable; we like the good young hero (sort of like Pug in Feist's THE RIFTWAR SAGA); it's familiar and we sometimes like to pretend we're this upcoming, great hero. You wont' get much of this in GRRM with the exception of one or two characters. There really aren't any super heroes compared to all the other characters as it's more grittier and no one is shooting fireballs every milisecond or carrying around some super powerful sword. (8) LENGTH: you don't want to get into a long fantasy epic series. In that case, look for shorters works as this is biiig. (9) PATRIARCHY: men are most of the main characters with lots of power (one female exception). While this is realistic of the medieval era, some readers may not prefer this if they want more girl power, so to speak. By the way, if you don't want to commit to a big book until you know the author better, check out his short story, THE HEDGE KNIGHT, in LEGENDS.","2005-11-28","United States","","true","8","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PUL7WR7SRTSZ"
"B000FCKGPC","4","A Great Transitional Story That Sets Up The Rest Of The Series","Minor Spoilers! AFFC is Martin's 4th book in his Ice and Fire series. Unlike the previous 3 books though, it is only half of one complete story. Martin split the 4th book in two due to length (the other half of the intended story is the 5th book A Dance With Dragons). Instead of just chopping the book in half though, Martin separates the stories geographically. This book primarily focuses on the action at King's Landing, The Iron Islands, Dorne as well as touching on the Eyrie, Braavos and the Riverlands. So if you are looking for any action from Jon Snow, Tyrion or Dany then your going to be disappointed. Jon appears briefly in the book, but their stories aren't furthered until the next book. Its hard to pin down exactly how this book continues the story that was left off with Storm of Swords. The War of the Five Kings is almost completed with Stannis the only rebel left at this point though his ability is limited due to his lack of numbers. This book is about the realm restoring itself after the war, or the lack of stability and goodwill following the war. The primary theme I would say its about is the failure of House Lannister in controlling the kingdom and finding out whats next as the real power players in the ""game of thrones"" begin to make their moves. The three primary storylines are: -King's Landing: With Joffrey and Tywin dead and Tyrion in exile, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister has become the self anointed defender of the realm and uses her surviving son Tommen as a puppet to allow herself to rule the kingdom. With her father and son dead and Tyrion gone, Cersei is finally the one running the kingdom as she feels is her birthright. But she isn't her father or her brother and despite her confidence in herself, her decisions begins to make more trouble in the realm. Out of jealously to the younger queen Margaery and forgetting her families role in saving King's Landing, Cersei begins to intentionally sabotage the relationship with the Tyrell's. She'll go to whatever lengths she can to hurt Highgarden's position at King's Landing, including trying to manipulate the High Septon and the Faith to her side. But despite Cersei's belief in herself, she isn't her father's true heir. -Dorne: We first met House Martell through Oberyn Martell aka The Red Viper, who came to King's Landing in SOS on his own personal mission to discover the truth about his sister's murder during Robert's Rebellion. With him dead now, factions in Dorne begin to lobby and attempt to manipulate Oberyn's elder brother Prince Doran to retaliate against the Lannister's, including his own daughter Princess Arianne. But Doran is not his brother and is much more calculating, it appears to everyone that he is going to bend the knee to the Lannister's but does everyone know what is really going on? -The Iron Islands: In the last book we found out that Lord Balon Greyjoy, self proclaimed King of the Iron Islands, was killed by falling off a bridge and his exiled brother Euron ""Crow's Eye"" Greyjoy showed up the next day and claimed his seat as King. The youngest Greyjoy brother, Priest Aeron ""Damphair"" Greyjoy, believes that his eldest surviving brother is unfit to be King and calls a Kingsmoot (a meeting where all the Iron Lords gather to decide their King) and decides to back his other elder brother Victarion for King. Victarian hates Euron because of what happened between them years ago and its the reason Euron was exiled. He doesn't have any intention of bending the knee to the brother who ruined his life. But Victarion isn't the only Greyjoy who intends to sit in the seastone chair either; Asha Greyjoy, Balon's (presumed) only surviving child believes herself to be the true heir to the Iron Islands and doesn't plan on backing down. Smaller storylines include: Jaime Lannister going to Rivverun and trying to tie up loose ends from the war while trying to maintain his promise to Lady Stark to not bring arms against House Stark or House Tully. Brienne of Tarth searching the Riverlands for Sansa Stark. Sansa herself hiding in the Eyrie under the false name of Alayne Stone while pretending to be Littlefinger's daughter. Sam Tarly leaving the wall and being sent to Oldtown to train to become the new Maester for the Night's Watch and Arya, now in Braavos and working as a servant for the Faceless Men. You have 13 different POV characters in this book (including one prologue character) and unlike Martin's last 3 book's that is one of the most frustrating things about the book. In the previous books you had one character for each part of the story (i.e- Catelyn was the POV character dealing with the Stark Army, Tyrion was in King's Landing, Jon Snow at The Wall, Davos for Stannis army etc.) but now you have so many different POV's for each story that you have a bunch of characters that only have 1-2 POV chapters, some of which you question why they even have chapters in the first place. This problem is especially notable with the story at Dorne. You've got 3 different POV characters; Princess Arianne Martell, Captain of the Guard Areo Hotah and Ser Arys Oakheart, a member of the Kingsguard.. Oakheart and Hotah only have 1 POV each and neither feels necessary to the story. Arianne has the only chapters where anything relevant happens, why not just put the minor information from those two characters chapters into hers? It also happens at the Iron Islands, though its not as irritating as in the Dorne story. You've got the Kingsmoot story from three different characters; Aeron, Victarion and Asha Greyjoy. After Aeron calls the Kingsmoot he ceases to be important to the story yet he gets more POV's than the other two. Asha probably doesn't even need her one POV chapter as everything you need to know about her comes from one of Victarion's chapters. Victarion is probably the only one of the three you really need. Its minor criticism but it can be a bit frustrating when you have to read a 20 page chapter from one character's perspective that feels like it amounts to nothing and then not have it expanded upon again for the rest of the story. Cersei has the most POV's with ten while Jaime and Brienne have the next most with seven each. Sam also has 5 and I think Sansa and Arya have 3-4 each. Everyone else has 1-2 chapters. Once everything gets going though it is still an entertaining read. Jaime's story in particular as he learns to adjust to life without a hand while still remaining the head of the Kingsguard is probably the best story in the book. Brienne's is probably the most frustrating. She was one of the most intriguing characters in the last two books, here she is given what feels like a pointless story as she wanders the Riverlands in vein looking for Sansa. It makes it even worse that we, the readers, know that she is looking in vein because we are reading Sansa's POV chapters and we know she is at the Eyrie. The only time something good happens is also the end of her story in this book, making things even more frustrating In the end it feels like a transitional story(or at least half of one). This story had to be written to get to a more important story. I feel like this is a set up to the final stories that concludes the series. But its Martin and its still a great and entertaining story, though its not as good as the first three books and its the only book in the series to not get 5 stars from me.","2013-10-18","United States","","true","9","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8GJWC5AHSV0Y"
"B000FCKGPC","4","A treat for fans of Westeros","I recently completed a re-read of this book and came away with such a hugely differing opinion from my first time through that I thought it important to encapsulate my thoughts here before they fade away with time. Upon my first read I was struck with a similar feeling to those critical of the book; namely that I didn't care about these new (or previously secondary) characters, and that the plot moved too slowly and ""nothing happens"". Clearly, my expectations coming into the book during both of my reads served to enhance my reaction. The first time through I had just finished A Storm Of Swords, in which nearly 1,300 pages flash by in an instant thanks to the plot moving at the speed of light. So much happens in that book. And AFFC is its polar opposite in terms of pacing and what it's focused on. ASOS is hurtling you through the climax of the War of the Five Kings, the instability of the Night's Watch and the Battle at the Wall, and Daenerys's aggressive escapades in the East. Even the more slowly paced chapters, such as the Arya chapters, are highlighted with some great, pulse-pounding moments, such as Sandor Clegane's trial in Hollow Hill. The book is full of climactic moments; I almost consider it to be the conclusion of A Song Of Ice And Fire's first arc. It's fantastic. A Feast For Crows, then, is not so much Martin beginning to pick up the pieces the first three novels have tossed around and establishing the beginning of the plot arcs for coming books (though he is certainly doing that), but Martin giving us a middle chapter in which we take a breath, look around, and survey all the chaos that has been wrought by the characters we've been following up until this point. Up until now, the focus has remained very deep and detailed; we're watching these characters' actions from the inside of their heads, primarily concerned with how they're going to attempt to accomplish their goals. AFFC sharply changes that. More than half of this book takes place in the eyes of Brienne (8/46 chapters), Cersei (10/46 chapters), and Jaime (7/46 chapters). Instead of each chapter taking place with characters across the globe from one another, we're now centered in Westeros' very core, with Cersei ruling King's Landing, Jaime spending time in King's Landing and the neighboring Riverlands, and Brienne wandering the Crownlands and the Riverlands. These areas have been hard hit by the war. The common people of the Westerlands, the Riverlands, and the Crownlands bore the brunt of the war, as you might expect. Entire villages are gone, burned lumps of ash sacked and looted, their people executed and raped for no real reason other than a Lannister, Stark, Frey, or whomever patrol had come through. But it's been bad for the ""haves"" of this society as well. Landed knights, minor lords, and even some great and storied Westerosi noble houses have had their holdings burned around them and their granaries cleaned out by passing armies leaving them to starve in the coming winter. Entire great houses that have been around for thousands of years are extinguished. One of the major points of this novel is that things are bad amongst everyone in Westeros, even the victors. Well, except maybe the crows. Hence the title. The plot does progress, albeit far more slowly than in any of the previous novels. The war is winding down, the climactic moments have occurred, and the victors are cleaning up what little resistance remains. So why did I enjoy this book so much? What fills the hole that all of these awesome, climactic moments have left? A Feast For Crows is the most atmospheric of all the novels in the series up to this point. Martin's writing has clearly improved from the initial novel in the series, and he lets it shine here. This series features some of best character and dialogue writing in all genre fiction, and it's on full display in this book. There are several instances in this book in which the dialogue was so excellent, I had to set it down and remark aloud: - Aemon Targaryen, 102-years old and dying, waking from a fitful sleep to address his long-dead brother; ""Egg? I dreamed I was old."" - Septon Meribald's ""broken man"" speech putting into perspective how hellish the prospect of war actually is for Westeros' serf class. - Thoros of Myr lamenting upon what war has done to the brotherhood; ""We were king’s men, knights, and heroes... but some knights are dark and full of terror, my lady. War makes monsters of us all."" - Mya Stone describing her memories of Robert Baratheon's love for her prior to his abandonment, and how she was raised by the mountains of the Eyrie after he left. This book is Martin's rumination upon why war is so terrible, why it's a net-negative for all of those involved. Nobody has come out of the War of the Five Kings in a better place than when they've started. The losers, obviously not. But even the victors. Their granaries are empty. Family members have died in the war or are marrying people they hate to bury the hatchet with previously rival houses. Vast swaths of lands and holdings have been destroyed. And while all of this death and destruction could have made a book like this a bleak slog of a read, Martin's consistently excellent mise en scène alleviates that problem, as does his inclusion of many minor characters who serve to heighten the story past what it could have been. The moments of beauty and hopefulness present in this novel contrast more sharply given their context. I understand that Martin's decision to split the narrative between this and A Dance With Dragons was a difficult one, but I really enjoy that A Feast For Crows stands on its own as his treatise on why war is such a terrible thing. It's a well-written, atmospheric treat for anyone who's a fan of this world, and coming into this novel a second time while knowing what to expect allowed me to enjoy it far more than I did the first time. The more I read, the more I found myself melting into its world, passively experiencing its characters and its setting, and becoming wholly immersed in what Martin has created. I didn't need the bombastic foolishness of the HBO series, or the climactic battles of the previous novel, or pulse-quickening episodes of single combat. I was too busy being enveloped in the pine trees gently rustling in the wind as Brienne, Pod, and Dick Crabb slowly meandered their way through the woods of Crackclaw Point. I was skipping alongside Arya as she explored the quiet canals of Braavos at night under a full moon. Or with Jaime and his pensiveness in Castle Darry as a fire crackles in the corner and the Autumn wind howls against the shutters. Reading A Feast For Crows is like watching one of those 10-hour long YouTube ambiance videos and sipping on hot wine while thinking about something as profound and serious as what total war says about humanity as a whole and does to humans as individuals, and I love that about it. What it lacks in explosiveness, it makes up for in subtlety and its impeccable craft. If that sounds boring to you, then you probably won't like this. But if you love Westeros as much as I do, you'll probably enjoy this book for what it is. TL;DR -- 4 stars for ASOIAF fans like myself who enjoy just ""being"" in this world, 3 stars for others who aren't as infatuated with Martin's world due to the slower plotting.","2011-07-06","United States","","true","10","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2X0UYTXLKO9ZK"
"B000FCKGPC","4","An Underrated Bridging Volume in the Series","It goes without saying that A Feast for Crows is possibly the most controversial book in George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire. Five years in the making, it followed A Storm of Swords, arguably the best book in the series and certainly the most eventful. Absent are fan-favorite characters Dany, Jon and Tyrion (well, almost absent - Jon Snow does put in an appearance early in the book, and Tyrion does appear as a monster in a dream). Absent too are the huge earth-shattering events of the previous three volumes. When Martin finished A Storm of Swords, he intended there to be a five year gap in the story before the opening of what was then considered to be the next volume, A Dance with Dragons. However, after writing a big chunk of the next novel, Martin found that the five year gap was untenable from a storytelling perspective. He discovered that he had to recount many of the events from the gap in flashback, which was slowing the main story thrust of the novel. He decided to step back and write a book that covered that five year gap. However, the book soon grew out of control, and ultimately he decided to split the book in two volumes -- A Feast for Crows and a new incarnation of A Dance With Dragons. At the heart of Martin's problem was something he came to call the ""Mereneese Knot."" I won't get into the story specifics (although I will say that I interviewed him about the knot, among other things, in episode 149 of Television Zombies), but that huge writing problem meant that certain characters could not appear in volume four of the novel until it was resolved. So he took all of the events that took place in the south and wrapped them into A Feast for Crows, and took all the events in the North and across the Narrow Sea and put them into A Dance With Dragons. The problem is, and this is pure conjecture on my part, that the POV chapters set in the south were originally intended to be supporting stories - not at all the main plot of the novel. And my guess is that since there wasn't enough there, he padded the book out with POV's taking place in Dorne and the Iron Islands, POV's that likely wouldn't have happened if the split had not occurred. This is not to say that the non-named POV chapters don't have merit, or important things don't happen in them, it's just that they could have been explained in brief exposition and not taken up half a book. A Feast for Crows, I believe, was a stopgap intended to placate readers while he wrestled with A Dance With Dragons. However, that said, A Feast for Crows is still a damned good book. It centers on the Lannister twins -- Jamie and Cersei -- and the different paths they take. Jaime, determined to write his own story in the Kingsguard's White Book the way that he would want to be remembered struggles to find honor and redemption, while Cersei desperately tries to retain her grasp on power in Kings Landing. Both arcs are surprisingly satisfying -- I thought Jaime was one of the most compelling characters in A Storm of Swords, and he really stands out as the hero of A Feast for Crows. Is Jaime a bad man trying to be good, or a good man who did bad things? It's hard to say, but I very much like where his journey takes him. Cersei, on the other hand, finally plays her cards -- the audience has never been aligned with her POV, and once we are, her take on events becomes, maybe not surprising, but not necessarily as expected. Unintended consequences have long been a theme of A Song of Ice and Fire, and nowhere is that more apparent than in Cersei's arc in Kings Landing. Supporting the Jaime and Cersei POV chapters are chapters featuring Brienne, Sam, Arya and Sansa. All interesting -- particularly Arya's two brief chapters -- though mostly padding. The chapters set in Dorne and the Iron Islands help to move playing pieces into position on the board, but are not as compelling as the named chapters (though I will say I liked getting more of an insight into those two settings). If viewed as a direct sequel to A Storm of Swords, then A Feast for Crows is nothing short of a massive disappointment. But if viewed as an epilogue to A Storm of Swords and as a prologue to A Dance With Dragons, A Feast for Crows is not without merit. Few fantasy novelists have taken the time to show the impact of war on regular people -- and Martin definitely spends a great deal of A Feast for Crows doing just that. It is a bleak novel, featuring a cast of characters who all feel left behind by their friends, family and loved ones. People who are trying to pick up the pieces after having lost everything. Longtime readers of Martin's work will see glimpses of some of his darker novels and short stories here -- yes, A Song of Ice and Fire is still pretty upbeat compared to a lot of Martin's older work (see Dying of the Light, for instance). Unfortunately, most of the chapters are unnecessary, and it is the weakest volume in the series to date. But the weakest volume in a great series is still pretty great, all things considered. Just make sure you go into the book knowing what to expect and enjoy it for what it is. And with A Dance with Dragons just around the corner, you don't have to go on thinking that A Feast for Crows might be where everything ends.","2011-06-25","United States","","true","11","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AR8LB8P0AMCL"
"B000FCKGPC","3","Well, OK...","I have to say this book was a disappointment. The first three books in this series were unquestionably 5-star reading. A Feast for Crows, however, truly was -- as one reviewer described it -- a chore to get through. I wondered often as I read it whether Martin would have fared better to collapse this book and the sequel, A Dance with Dragons, into one volume after all. The argument that the book would have then been too long doesn't wash with me since many of the chapters here -- far too many -- felt like ""packing material"", the popcorn and bubblewrap that you have to dig through to get to the good stuff that you really wanted and paid for. A Feast for Crows would have been a far better book if the dross chapters had been eliminated and the pure gold chapters from the next book added in. Ah, well. Too late for that now. Sadly, in this book, I just got bored. Not only once, but again and again. And I am astounded to say that because Martin is a magnificent writer and storyteller. But I was seriously bored with much of this book. I did not like Martin's departure from the style of previous books of adding so many nameless (""The Prophet"", ""The Kraken's Daughter"", etc.) point-of-view (POV) chapters. Sheesh. Why not just say their names? ""Aeron"" ... ""Asha"" ... Worse still, most of these ""secondary"" POV chapters were quite dull. I did not like these characters and I did not want to invest my time in them because it is not THEIR story I am interested in in this series. Many of these secondary characters are repellent, dull, and/or unpleasant, and each new character's chapter(s) carried the baggage of (seemingly) 50 to 60 new names and characters apiece. Even the primary POVs in this volume, including Brienne, Jaime, and Cersei, are not particularly likable or interesting. That leaves about 20% of the book that really held my interest. Only the Samwell, Arya, and Sansa chapters held my attention here, and the latter two characters appear very little in this particular volume. The one good thing about this overall structure was that at least I knew before reading a chapter that I probably wasn't going to enjoy it: ""Brienne"", ""Cersei"", ""Jaime"", ""Unnamed"" = Not Terribly Interesting. Best not be sleepy if you want to get through any of these chapters in one sitting. To the author's credit, the pace of Feast for Crows does pick up toward the end of the book, which, alas, once again leaves us hanging for heaven knows how long until the next book is published -- longer still if these particular ""King's Landing"" POV plot threads are not to be picked back up until Book 6. Patience, more than any other quality, is required of readers of this series. Even so, I am committed to this series for the long haul. Martin at his worst is better than most writers in this genre at their very best. He is a most gifted and talented writer, and I trust he can get back on course for the next book in this series. I am keeping my fingers crossed that there is someone in this process that can effectively tell Martin, for future volumes in this series, ""Yo, dude. This chapter is well written, surely, but it really ought to be cut..."" EDIT, June 10, 2011-- In anticipation of the publication of Book 5, A Dance with Dragons, next month, I have been rereading this series. The first three books were a joy (yet again), but this one, not so much. If you are tackling Book 4, A Feast for Crows, either for the first time or if you're rereading the series, and you find yourself struggling with this particular volume, I recommend the following: (1) Read the Prologue. (2) Then skip to chapter 5, the first Samwell chapter, and read it. (3) Thereafter, read ONLY the Jaime, Sansa/""Alayne"", Arya/""Cat of the Canals"", and Samwell chapters. Skip all of the Cersei, Brienne, and remaining ""Unnamed"" chapters -- all of them. (4) Finally, after that, check the A Feast for Crows Wikipedia entry for brief plot synopses of the portions you skipped past. This cuts the book by more than half, I know, but trust me. It's better this way. The Prologue and final Samwell chapter give the book a satisfying sense of completion and closure, and the story overall moves along at a much brisker clip. Of the two Lannisters represented here (how I missed Tyrion in this book!), Jaime is definitely more interesting than Cersei, and he lets you know all you really need to know about Cersei (and Brienne, too) from his point of view. And, of course, the skipped chapters will always be there, waiting for you, just like the La Brea Tar Pits, should you ever feel inclined to wade through them.","2006-11-29","United States","","true","12","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RURULGX9I92DG"
"B000FCKGPC","4","Not the best volume, not as bad as some say","Needing a bit of escapism now, I just finished reading this book within about two weeks, and thus have read now the first four volumes of this series within two months. This compressed schedule may have helped make the plot easier to follow, but it is admittedly a convoluted and sometimes frustrating plot to follow. I'm not going to try hard to avoid plot spoilers, so don't read on if that's a problem for you. As some have said, it is true we have many characters who seem to wander in pursuit of purposes we can predict they will not achieve. It's hard to invest in characters we know won't arrive where they are trying to go, nor mostly to achieve what they intend. That's not to say the plot is overly predictable -- that which frustrates our characters' goals is usually quite a plot twist. The problem I see here is that the first three books led me to find three characters very interesting -- Tyrion, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen. Now, the plots drift off to bring in many new folks and tells us little about these three. In other words, the disappointment is more who is not much here than who and what is in this book. I entirely disagree with those who say not much happens. True, the reader does sense much of the material is set up for plot action to come, which has not arrived by the end of this volume. But plenty happens, too. The final major resistance to the Lannisters is ended the War of Five Kings. Cersei and Jamie grow apart but their characters develop considerably. Sansa makes it to safety in the Vale with her Aunt only to have Petyr kill the Aunt and re-create great uncertainty for Sansa. Stannis shows up with his whole army on the Wall. The Septs are becoming a major force. Dorne and the Iron Islands were just places barely mentioned, but now we have real development of what those places are about. We see that Westeros is slowly learning that there are live dragons again, leading more than one to ship off in search of Daenyris, who buy the way becomes a conquering Queen. We learn the dead Catelyn seems to have come back to life in some form. Not much happening? Yet I would like to have seen something about where Bran is, and why he is heading north of the Wall, among many other subplots that are nearly absent. All the same, after reading reviews I wondered if I really wanted to bother with this book and the next. The answer is that after finishing this, I downloaded book five to my Kindle the same day. Part of the problem is that the author has a very big plot line to flesh out, and his style is anything but terse. He lists the names of ships after mentioning a fleet, lists of house names, lists of relatives and members of a family, etc., etc., etc., Zzz-z-z. I lost nothing by skipping over them. This led to the author's well-known problem writing this, which creates a problem for this volume. He says he hit over 1500 pages and had much more to go, which he knew would be unacceptable to publishers. He decided to divide the book in two by subjects. This one covers events in Westeros, and the next is more focused on the East. That clumsy choice suggests the next volume will have similar plot line problems. A big problem for Kindle users - no maps! The paper books include maps that help enormously, as following the plot without understanding more than the narrative clearly provides about what is where is near impossible. Kindle includes the maps, but with no ability to magnify them reading even major place names is challenging. I suggest book marking [...] for a pretty good map which includes the East, which the books' maps do not. My fear is that this series may never finish. The author says he plans seven volumes, and so far has five. The last is less than a year old as of this writing. So when will Book six be out? Book seven? And will they really complete the story arc? Or will the seven volume plan be like George Lucas' comments when Star Wars came out, that he planned a nine episode epic only to say after six he had no idea what more to do with the story line, and would make no more? Finally, a short glossary might help. It's frustrating to hear King's Landing is building ""drommonds"" without much about what sort of ship that is, for example.","2012-06-07","United States","","true","13","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R301RGM7DVRUNH"
"B000FCKGPC","4","Cersei's wicked tale","I had read that ""A Feast for Crows"" is many fans' least favorite book in George R.R. Martin's epic ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", and I can understand why. Due to length, Martin had to split his sequel to ""A Storm of Swords"" into two volumes that take place at the same time. He broke them up geographically, and as a result, the stories of fan-favorite characters like Daenerys, Jon Snow, and Tyrion are left for the fifth book, ""A Dance with Dragons."" But there is plenty in A Feast for Crows to make it a very good read, even if it's not as shocking as ""A Storm of Swords"" or as climactic as ""A Clash of Kings."" Most of ""A Feast for Crows"" deals with the aftermath of Tywin Lannister's death, though at its heart this book is Cersei Lannister's tale. She's determined to rule all of Westeros as queen regent, fancying herself as a master of the ""game of thrones,"" even greater than her late father. But her brother Jamie probably puts it best: ""Their father had been as relentless and implacable as a glacier, where Cersei was all wildfire, especially when thwarted."" And the novel bears this out. Cersei is a dangerous disaster, and her list of perceived enemies is long, including all of House Tyrell (with extra venom for the Queen of Thorns), her uncle Kevan, her brother Tyrion--and Jaime to some extent--the sellsword Bron, Varys the Spider, Grand Maester Pycelle, and even the High Septon. All of this makes Cersei into a fitting replacement for Joffrey as the character that readers will love to hate. The most interesting early revelation about Cersei in this book is her fixation on an old witch's prophecy: ""Queen you shall be,"" said the witch, ""until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down . . ."" Cersei's obsession over this prophecy sets up a major conflict between her and her young son Tommen's pretty new wife-to-be, Margaery Tyrell. It also leads to the novel's stunning climax--one that will leave you pining for ""The Winds of Winter"" to see how it all ends! While Cersei's story steals the show, Jaimie's develops in satisfying fashion as he tries to wrap up the war Robb Stark started after Ned Stark's death. Truth be told, I've found Jaimie Lannister to be one of the more likable characters in the series of late. And it's easy to forget he threw a seven-year-old Bran Stark out a window in the early chapters of the first book. Separate from the stories of Jamie and Cersei, the book follows Brienne's quest to find Sansa Stark, Arya's journey across the Narrow Sea, Sansa's time in the Eyrie after her aunt's murder, and Sam's journey to the Maesters' Citadel with Gilly and Maester Aemon after Jon orders them to leave The Wall for Aemon's safety. (As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, Jon's fears that King Stannis' priestess, Lady Melisandre, might kill the old Targaryen to use his royal blood in one of her spells.) Arya has been one of my favorite characters in the series, but her scenes in this book are a bit of a letdown. That said, Martin is clearly setting up something big for her, but it's hard to tell where her story is leading. Sansa's tale is also a bit ho-hum, yet through it Martin reveals the purpose behind Littlefingeer's elaborate plots. In short, it looks like Littlefinger may be the true master of the ""game of thrones."" In addition to these tales, the novel includes two other storylines, both of which are pretty good. The first involves the Ironborn after the death of Balon Greyjoy and the struggle over who will replace him on the Seastone Chair. The second--which was totally unexpected--concerns the land of Dorne and the daughters and niece of Oberyn Martell, all of whom want vengeance against the Lannister's after Oberyn's death at King's Landing. Except the family's patriarch, Doran Martell, has very different plans. Overall, most of this book is setup for what promises to be a dramatic series of events in The Winds of Winter. No storyline is resolved, and the novel ends with a MAJOR cliffhanger. I'll admit that one of the storylines had me furious at Martin, for it seemed like he led a significant character to a senseless and overly cruel death. I was so angry, I jumped onto the internet to see if that was, if fact, this character's end. Fortunately, it may not be, and it sets up yet another cliffhanger that longs for resolution (so GRRM is totally forgiven - for now). In the end, I too ended up liking A Feast for Crows less than the first three books. But the stories involving Cersei and Jamie were so well done, it's ultimately a very good read.","2014-06-18","United States","","true","14","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1A2R5FTCQRZEE"
"B000FCKGPC","4","Sad, Lost, and Not Long Enough","It's been a long five years. Since _A Storm of Swords_ was released in 2000, it's been long enough for fans around the world to imagine storyline resolutions, to decide how they want everything to happen over the rest of the series, and to despair of ever reading that series. It's been so long, and with so much expectation, that it would take a wizardly author to please everyone with a miraculous book. If _A Feast for Crows_ is not that book, George R.R. Martin is that author, and it's his own fault that almost nothing he could have produced after all this time would have been considered enough. _A Storm of Swords_ ended on a knife point of prospect: Arya set sail for Braavos, leaving Sandor Clegane dying on the Trident's banks, Tyrion fled King's Landing for parts unknown, Bran trekked to the north in the company of Coldhands, and Sansa was trapped in the devious hands of Littlefinger atop the Eyrie. Danaerys, the other Lannisters, and the Ironborn were left in not much less disarray. Over its 900-plus pages, _Storm_ drove relentlessly to a breathless, brilliant finish. _Feast_ is a quieter book, and not simply because it is missing half of the storylines in Bran, Tyrion, Dany, and Jon. Where _Storm_ raged, with river and fire and the bone-soaking rain of a dying summer, _Feast_ is the dry skittering of dead leaves. The armies that turned central Westeros into bloody mud are gone, and the soldiers and broken men that are left are going, although where, they may not know. This displacement pervades the book, even down to the chapter headings. Mr. Martin maintains the tradition of having a few central characters carry his chapters, in this case Arya, Sansa, Brienne, Jaime, Samwell, and Cersei, who thread throughout the book. However, for the first time there are single-instance headings for various of the Ironborn and Dornish: small glimpses into small characters. Even beyond this, the larger six headings are not always themselves: these people are wearing new faces or searching for them, and their paths and even names are ever-changing as they spin. Going home, or going bad, they're lost, and the way is anything but clear. The smallness isn't limited to the size of the story or the actions: it describes the characters themselves. Most of the big players, the ones who sweep over cities and mountains, are gone, and those who are left are brought low. King's Landing enacts like a petty town council, with base men feebly waving their arms where once great ones blazed. The Iron Islands and Dorne have no heroes either; all seem villians or possible villians. Mr. Martin has never given us merely black-and-white characters, but there are some who embody more hope than others. Those, Bran, Jon, and Dany, are missing from this _Feast_, and we are left with the vengeful, the reluctant, and the uncertain. There are terrible moments here, and grisly fights with words and swords, but often even the deaths are numbed, those who lived most noisily dying with a whisper, a soft story told by another, not seen for ourselves. This does not lessen their impact, but it turns us into scavengers as well, scrabbling Mr. Martin's words to us in order to take every morsel from them we can. _Feast_ is not _Storm_, nor is it the end of the series. It is not meant to contain the rest of the story that we've been waiting for, but to continue it, which it does, in its own way. It might be easy to dismiss its wandering characters as aimless and not worth the time, certainly not the time it took for them to finally arrive. But Mr. Martin knows exactly what he is doing here, as frustrating as it may be to us. Would _Feast_ have been a different book had publishing constraints not forced him to divide the story? Of course. Possibly it might have been better, and felt as complete as the others. But on its own, it is a powerful furtherance of Mr. Martin's deeply conscious world, and it works. We need to see the affects of these wars on the smaller people they left behind: it wouldn't be enough to paint grand strokes again. The grief of _Storm_ was drummed into us with rain and battle; the poignancy of _Feast's_ vagabonds seeps in like the creaking of a bare gray branch in a cold wind. It's not as noticeable as an axe-blow to the head, but can harry the soul just as much.","2005-11-13","United States","","true","15","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFXFEDU1ZLWO2"
"B000FCKGPC","5","There is a difference between bad reviews and BAD REVIEWERS","For many years, I held off starting this series because of the negative reviews and complaints. But after enough friends compared the series to The Wire in terms of scope and complexity, I realized that I had to give it a shot. Now I believe that this series represents one of the masterworks in the fantasy genre. There is nothing I can add to the positive reviews but I would like to address the negative reviews. If you look closely you will realize there are very few bad reviews, ONLY BAD REVIEWERS!!! The vast majority of negative reviews can be broken down into a few groups: BAD REVIEWERS GROUP ONE: Children (emotionally or mentally). I stopped reading fantasy books in my early twenties because they are, by and large, childish and simplistic. Some reviewers complain that they don't like the characters or can not identify with the characters Mr. Martin has created. I can only assume that these people want HEROES and VILLAINS. To those reviewers I say - stick with Disney films. The characters created by Mr. Martin are complex and ambiguous. In fact, many of the characters I hated in the first book, I found myself rooting for by the third book. BAD REVIEWERS GROUP TWO: Impatient amusement park riders. I will be the first to admit that it is hard to wait to find out what happens next. But people who want Mr Martin to ""finish the series"" seem to be operating under the faulty assumption that this series will end in some glorious conclusion that ties everything together. I have no such expectation. This is not Lord of the Rings. Good will not eternally triumph over evil and justice will not be granted for everyone. If that is what you are looking for, then you are craven and should return to your childish fairy-tales! BAD REVIEWERS GROUP THREE: The Choose your own adventurers. By books three and four you will notice more and more reviewers complaining about which characters Mr. Martin focuses on. Rarely, if ever, do they complain about the quality of the prose or the rich detail of this world Martin has created. Usually their reviews can be boiled down to - ""I want to know what happens to so and so right now!"" They also like to complain that some chapters are just filler that do not relate to the story. It seems to me that this complaint is premature until the series is complete. Minor characters in the first book are major characters in the third book and some characters disappear in the first book only to pop up again in the third. With this in mind I will assume that these filler characters or the information revealed in their chapters is relevant to later parts of the story. If you like a chef, you will be excited to eat whatever he dishes up. Not all of the meals will be to your taste but what you enjoy is the chef's creativity and boldness, not a specific flavor. This group of bad reviewers loved the first meal dished out and now they want everything to taste the same - To them I say - stick with Taco Bell! That way you always know what you are getting. BAD REVIEWERS GROUP FOUR: The Kindle reviews. Reviews regarding kindle formatting have no place amidst the book reviews. And some of these people complain that the kindle version should never cost more than the paperback version. I would argue that having all of the books in a slender little device is an added bonus that is worth something in-and-of-itself. Just imagine trying to travel with all five books! If you have the patience and maturity to go on this journey then I urge you to do so. Leave your expectations at the door and let the story unfold as it will. If you are going to read a story that is thousands of pages long, I would hope you are there for the journey, not the destination. For the rest of you, enjoy your Disney/taco bell/fairy-tales. Thank you, Mr. Martin for creating such a rich and surprising world. I am along for the ride, wherever it leads, and for however long it lasts!","2011-06-20","United States","","true","16","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6X8577T6LM8Y"
"B000FCKGPC","4","More passive than action-packed","This is the very first time I'm going to write a review for a book, as I never had the patience to write in ""the formal ways"" of a book report. I'm a fan of GRRM's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series just recently (I finished the first book just as I started watching Season 1 on HBO). I got hooked on the first 3 books, and now, I am more than half done with the fourth -- I realize why a lot of people rate this a 3-star rather than the usual 4-5 on the first three installments of the series. Here's what I can say, without going into too much details and spoilers... I don't think ""A Feast for Crows"" is a badly-written book -- GRRM is still consistent with the way he writes the story. It didn't go ""bad"" just because the author has given up or tried to drag it on for the sake of profit, that's for sure. He still kept his element of storytelling, and I still enjoyed it. The main reason I think why people gave it a lower rating is that because in this book he focuses on the ""minor"" Houses -- those who got thrown in the background during the first 3 installments. He did include the stories some of the major characters that were in the first 3 books (namely, Queen Cersei, Jaime, Sansa, Arya, and Brienne), though, but roughly 70% of the chapters are dedicated to either Pyke (the ironmen in general), Dorne, or Highgarden (possibly other locations I hardly remember). The book opens up the story of the ironmen, which I have to admit was pretty slow-paced, although I'm keeping an eye out for Asha Greyjoy. Brienne's adventures also dragged on, with not much progress halfway through the book. The ""juicy"" pieces for me was Queen Cersei's growing paranoia with Lady Margaery and the entire Tyrell family (Jaime somewhat got thrown in the background but he still plays a major, yet somewhat comical part in Cersei's life). Arya's adventures in Braavos is also a highlight -- I personally thought it was more like a ""rite of passage"" for her into seeing the real world as a kid no more. Sansa remains the graceful lady living a different life at the Eyrie, but still has her own conflicts she has to deal with -- not as bad as her ordeal with her betrothal to ex-King Joffrey, though. To me, ""A Feast for Crows"" is like, well, a feast for crows. It's the aftermath of the horrible massacre of the northmen at the Twins (the ""red wedding""), and the death of a young king (King Joffrey or King Robb, your pick) -- there is more movement of alliances, the northmen survivors split up and struggling to get by with the loss of the north after the red wedding, and the foreshadowing of the collapse of House Lannister (at least maybe, because we all know that Cersei's cunning might get her out of yet another mess). Overall, I did enjoy the book, even though some parts of it was indeed dragging. GRRM has introduced a slew of characters that were very minor on the first 3 books, so it's sort of a ""shock"" for those who've read the previous books to shift into a new set of characters with a different storyline and minimal tie-in with the previous ones. GRRM could have just made the fourth book to wrap up the series for the main characters that were built on the first three, and instead created a ""spin-off"" series for the minor characters. [TL;DR] I can say, for those who are expecting to read ""A Feast for Crows"" because you can't wait to know what happened to the characters from books 1 to 3, better not expect much. This book is more passive than action-packed. It is still necessary to read this installment and get familiar with the new characters, because I have a feeling that they will eventually play a key part in building the story back up on the last two books for the series that haven't been published yet. These two middle books it seems (haven't read the next book but it looks like the reviews have pretty much the same tune as this one has) is more of GRRM's efforts to ""pick through the knots"" from the fabric of the main story before he slowly unravels it in the end.","2012-07-30","United States","","true","17","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTRA7M861UH2"
"B000FCKGPC","5","5 STARS 5 STARS ...... MARTIN HAS RETURNED AND WE SHOULD BE HAPPY","Let me start by saying that I am very disappointed in those reviews that do not quite see the merit in this new installment of a Song of Fire and Ice. I would agree with any earlier review that downgraded the editing, but I would have to think that Mr. Martin was aware of this and for some reason wnated the book to come out this way. There is a wealth of information that has been dedicated to: CERSEI - we find out more about her hatred and her desire to be the queen of Westeros. I think he has also developed her into a force to be reckoned with and has shown a rift between her and JAIME. JAMIE - While he continues to lament over his lost hand he shows a weaker side in his relationship to BRIENNE and her task at hand. I think that Martin has also shown a wonderful change in the realtionship between her and her sister and possibly a feeling that JAIME has not made the mose noble of decisions throughout his life and possible at this point he is maturing SER LORAS - lets just say he remains a subtle character but important BRIENNE - while I didn't really care for her in the other tomes I think he has really made her into a main character and someone that I was looking forward to in the book. Hers is probably the most noble of the Kingsguard as we see the other knights not staying true to their vows. Brienne is what all of the knights should be and yet they chastise her because she is a woman. SANSA and ARYA - Their lines are very short but they are present. I think the character of Sansa has defintely been given more of role and she should as an older sister. MAERGERY TYRELL - The young queen developed throughout the book and for a while I though she was simply going to be steamrolled by CERSEI and while we never really see her direct intervention I think little MAERGERY is much smarter than we think and I believe she will be around for time to come. SAMWELL - while he was in the book more than anyone else on the wall it was a very small part and I would have to say the most boring part of the book, but probably the most important part of the storyline as he is going to seek someone out that will change the land forever. The people we hear almost nohing about: TYRION - What a shame as he is one of the more colorful. JON SNOW - Maybe a few lines in one chapter but otherwise not present. BRAN - completely absent DAENERYS - Very small part and one chapter as a teaser at the end of the book. I am not a particular fan of Dany so this part did not really effect me too much, but she will obviously be a major role in a DANCE WITH DRAGONS. STANNIS and MELISANDRE - absent but coming Overall, I can see the reason so many people are upset by this book, but it truely is a marvelous work and I enjoyed reading every page of it. If the next installment were coming out this month then I think everyone would be happy, but this is not so. My one complaint is that he seems to have gone to every effort to include names of people that really are not a part of the book. He may mention them in a passing conversation and since there are already so many characters it can get confusing at times. Thank goodness he has included a glossary of the houses and characters for us when we get confused. In his own words Mr Martin said ""This one was a Bi*ch"" I think we have to give him the trust and blind faith that we know he is going to bring us to the end. I can't even fathom writing a story of this magnitude and think it is a blessing that we have such auhors. Give the man a break and be patient.

"B000FCKGPC","4","The long wait is finally over","Like many of Martin's fans, I've been waiting for this book for what seems an eternity. I could hardly contain my excitement when I made my weekly visit to the author's website and saw the giant headline proclaiming, ""It's Done!"" But at the bottom of the page was a footnote that said ""(sort of)."" For those who may not be familiar with what happened here, Martin's manuscript simply became too large to publish in one volume, and so he decided to split it in two, with this book telling half the characters' stories, and the others' pushed back until A Dance With Dragons is done. So, does it work? Sort of. Our main POV characters this time around are Samwell Tarly, Brienne of Tarth, Arya and Sansa Stark, and Jamie and Cersei Lannister. Fans will note the absences right away: we still don't know what became of Bran, on a trek through the far north with the mysterious Coldhands; or what manner of troubles Jon Snow is having on the wall with Stannis and the wildlings; or where Tyrion has gotten himself to (though we can guess); or what Dany has been up to, far to the east. However, Martin has taken a bit of a different approach this time. In addition to the main characters, three minor characters have one chapter each, and three others have two each, titled with descriptions rather than the characters' proper names. We have The Prophet, The Captain of the Guards, The Soiled Knight, and so on. As such, this book branches out a bit more than its predecessors, and we get to spend some time in a few locations that we've seen little or nothing of thus far -- most notably, Dorne. There's been much speculation over what would happen there following the Red Viper's death in A Storm of Swords, and some of that is revealed in A Feast For Crows. That said, the downside to this diversity is that few of the storylines make considerable forward progress. With Martin putting off half of his main characters until the next volume, one might expect that each character in this novel would advance more than usual, but in fact we get the opposite. Even when little is happening, Martin is still a strong enough writer that the book is always interesting, but while this certainly isn't a bad novel by any means, it's easily the weakest in the series. As for the individual characters: Cersei's chapters are good; despite how monstrous the woman is, she is in King's Landing, at the heart of power and influence in Westeros, which means that interesting things are always happening. Jaime is equally interesting as his character continues to develop and change. Arya has always one of my favorite characters, second only to Tyrion, so I love every page of that, but there are precious few pages devoted to her, and her part of the story ends so abruptly that you'll be wondering whether a chapter was left out by mistake. Sansa herself has never interested me much, but with the master schemer Petyr Baelish close at hand, her chapters are never dull. Samwell is not a favorite of mine either, though there's still a few provocative moments to be experienced there. Brienne, however, achieves nothing except to take valuable pages away from better characters. It's still Martin, which means it's still good, but I can't help feeling a little underwhelmed by this volume. It's well written and has its moments, but it seems to be building towards a climax that it never quite reaches. Since the events in A Dance With Dragons will presumably be taking place at the same time as those herein, my guess is that that book may very well suffer from a similar lack, but I'll be as quick to buy that one as I was to get this. I'm really looking forward to seeing what will happen thereafter. I just shudder to think how many years we'll have to wait...","2005-11-12","United States","","true","19","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RE8VWQDVWRD02"
"B000FCKGPC","4","aptly titled.","Fool that I am, when I finished A STORM OF SWORDS I thought the worst was over. After such an apotheosis of misery, GRRM had to pause for a breath, cut us some slack, mix some good times with the bad. I hoped he'd start dragging us out of the cesspit of misery he'd made of Westeros, that we'd reach the end of the dark tunnel and see dawn ahead. Apparently, I am an idiot. As Tywin Lannister would say, GRRM has taught me a sharp lesson. I'm too deeply invested in this series to stop reading, but I expect nothing but pain and grief from future installments. If you ask me, A FEAST FOR CROWS was darker and more painful than A STORM OF SWORDS. It starts slow; it felt like reading A GAME OF THRONES all over again, with GRRM building up his stories from scratch, getting his characters moving and sending them out in the world with new challenges. The beginning of a new act, a new arc. The pace picks up around the halfway point, and then? Well, a friendly warning: brace yourself. Quick FAQ: A FEAST FOR CROWS takes place directly after A STORM OF SWORDS ends, but only follows the action in Westeros, around King's Landing. The main POV characters we read from are Cersei, Brienne, Jaime, Arya, and Sansa. We also have a new plotline based around the Iron Islands, and one set in Dorne. The other main POV characters (Jon, Dany, and Tyrion, for example) appear in ASoIF #5, A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, which takes place during the same time frame as A FEAST FOR CROWS. On one level, I probably should have expected a dreary sort of book. The War of the Five Kings has lulled to a halt, and winter sets in by the end of the book. Westeros is a cold, ruined landscape. It's burned, pillaged, and frigid. Our characters wander through storms, through forests of hanged men, through burned villages. They are on impossible quests, fighting losing battles, and some of them know it. There are more deaths. I don't know why so many reviewers seem convinced that nothing happens in this book. If you ask me, a ton of stuff happens. There's a rushed feeling to some storylines (every time we meet up with Arya, for example, she's in a new place with a new identity, and I would have loved to spend more time with her, watching her evolve), but there are some major changes to the game board in this book, and to characters that i cared about. On another level, I think GRRM makes some actual, quantifiable, not just me whining about my poor feelings mistakes in this book. He introduces two new major plot-nodes, the Iron Islands & Dorne. That's cool; I love this world and I'm glad to explore more and more of it. But he hops from POV to POV within these plotlines. The Iron Islands story gets three different POV characters; the Dorne story gets four. It's hard to attach to these new places and people when GRRM keeps hopping from head to head. The other thing that really bothered me is Cersei. I didn't expect to like Cersei. But she'd always been 9 parts horrible and 1 part truly magnificent. I found her to be shortsighted and vicious and a lot of other bad things, but I didn't think she was foolish. The Cersei we meet in A FEAST FOR CROWS has no redeeming qualities. Not one. She's not funny, she's not smart, she's not good. GRRM dives into her POV but she emerges shallower and less nuanced than she'd started out, and that's a shame. A FEAST FOR CROWS really bummed me out. It's such a sad, dreary book, with such low lows and so few highs. I sort of wish I could stop reading, but instead I'm going to start A DANCE WITH DRAGONS.","2013-06-20","United States","","true","20","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LZEVEUDHKVJP"
"B000FCKGPC","4","Feast on ye crows!","After reading the 3rd book in the series, ""A Storm of Swords"" I was disappointed at how many main characters were killed off - some seemingly needlessly and with little reason. ""A Feast for Crows"" remedies this and tells a great story in the process. The POV characters have changed a little but we get a fresh and interesting view on events of the world from these characters and - no major ones are killed off! Yay! I really think Martin must have realized he was on a course for pure disaster if he would have continued in that manner. OK, so enough about that.... The 4th book is a ""split"" of an originally much larger book. You will only encounter certain characters and wonder what all of the others are up to. Not to worry , they will all get their say in book 5. Although this may seem frustrating to some readers, I found it to be a good decision. It allows the reader to focus more on the characters presented here and really learn more about this specific group. For example, you get to learn more about the goings-on in Dorne - an area only marginally mentioned previously. You get to see another side to Samwell Tarly that I really enjoyed. His character has grown and changed and I really like where I perceive him to be headed. Arya Stark also has changed in a very different way - extremely interesting - it is almost as if she is seeing the world through fresh eyes and in new ways that she never thought she would. I love that her learning experiences are so intense - her character is great. The Greyjoys - pure awesomeness in this book. One of my favorite viewpoints. You get to see a true sea-faring clan at its best. All I can see is beware for the kraken's tentacle is about to wrap itself around the lands of Westeros and pull it down kicking and screaming! One of the most overlooked yet most interesting plot lines in my opinion. Euron Greyjoy is a truly fearsome pirate if there ever was one! But I must say, the character whose story is the absolute most awesome, gripping, amazing story in this book is - are you ready? - CERSEI !! She has undergone a big change to me. She has gone from being just mean and vindictive queen to outright, flat-out, psychotic, obsessive craziness. And I love it! You'll have to read it for yourself to believe it! Her story is pure genius by Martin. I can't help it - she's just SO damn evil! :) As long as you can read the book and enjoy it for what it is, you will be fine. Go into it knowing that it is a ""split"" of a much larger mega-book that Martin had originally planned and you will see why he did what he did. It just would not have been fair to all of the characters. Don't worry - you'll find out what is happening to the other characters soon enough - Martin even says as much near the back of the book! Here is something very, very odd about the printing of the book itself - somewhere around page 565 I believe, the pages are completely out of order for about 10 pages. It jumps from 565 to 575 to 567 or some such thing. Very, very strange - poor editing perhaps? Or maybe trying to make one too many revisions before going to press? Overall, A Feast for Crows continues the bold, rich story that you have grown to love, just from a certain select few characters. Read it, Love it, Enjoy it, and to get the most out of it, immerse yourself fully in the magic world Martin has created with this series. You will not regret a moment of it!

"B000FCKGPC","5","Perhaps not as good as books 1-3, but still great","I had a harder time getting into this book than I did the first three in the series. I started and stopped reading it a few times over a LONG period before I finally committed to finishing it. This had me tempted to give it 4 stars instead of 5. This could be due to personal preferences. Large sections of this book focus on Greyjoy succession drama, which… I just have a harder time caring about compared to most of the other plots. But once I got over myself and truly committed to finishing it, I found myself immersed and enjoying it as much as I did the others. It’s way better than the show was by this point. I’ve even telling people that Book 3 is where you start to see the show going off the rails, but you weren’t quite aware of it yet if you hadn’t read the books. In this book, it’s on full display. The ways in which the showrunners started deviating from the books — and the degrees to which they deviated — sparked the beginning of what turned into the downfall of the show.","2025-01-31","United States","","true","22","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NC1KXOZP4CKE"
"B000FCKGPC","3","Fantasy falls to nihilism's sword","The breathlessly awaited fourth installment in Martin's brilliant saga has finally been published here in the U.S. Many of his faithful readers, including yours truly, have been waiting literally for years to sink their mental teeth into this feast. When my own copy -- pre-ordered nearly a year ago --came in the mail, I tore into it with more excitement than any book I have read in years. Of course, with these kind of expectations, some degree of letdown was almost certain. However, high hopes aside, it cannot be reasonably argued that this novel was up to the standards set by the previous three. Some on this site and others may argue that this is a ""set-up"" novel, whatever that means -- as if a professional author should truly need over 700 pages to set up a plot that has been ongoing now for three books. Besides, most hear this logic and are unfortunately reminded of another fantasy author who notoriously lost his way at approximately this same point in his saga, and was defended almost religiously by his fan-base in the same manner. Others, in a more reasonable argument, point to the slower pace of this installment as compared to the previous three and explain it as a natural progression of events in a post-war world. Indeed, it seems understandable that the Seven Kingdoms would take a deep breath and regroup after what has been years of nearly non-stop bloodshed and brutality. However, these points aside, this reader feels that the most problematic aspect of Martin's newest work is its nearly overwhelming sense of pointlessness. By this I don't mean that there is no plot. Essentially, the plot is the same it has been since the first book. Nor that there is no significant progression of the plot. After all, several characters go on personal quests, moving throughout Westeros and its neighboring kingdoms and meeting various hardships and attempting to overcome them. There is even action of a sort, though it is in a much more muted and personal fashion than we have previously seen. No, the pointlessness I speak of is one that is much more troubling. It is the same philosophy that permeates most of our American cinema, our music, and practically all of our modern literature: nihilism. The sense that, overall, nothing really much matters. Whether you attempt to do good, or evil, or whether you are simply ""out for yourself"" in a sort of ethical looting orgy, it is all ultimately futile. It is something of a cliche to state that ""no good deed goes unpunished"", but that is usually meant at least partially tongue in cheek. In Martin's universe, it is not black humour, but seemingly cosmic law. To an extent this is a refreshing change of pace from the usual black and white, us vs. them mentality found in a great deal of fantasy novels. It is tedious and familiar to instantly ascertain the hero, the villain, and who will eventually triumph within the first twenty pages. On the other hand, and here Martin most notably is at fault, it is similarly tedious to know that almost as soon as a given character attempts an act of selflessness, or deals with someone honorably, or simply abstains from kicking someone while they are down, they will eventually be repaid with failure. And what spectacular, sadistic failures! Martin is not content to simply allow his noble characters to fail at their goals. They are humiliated, tortured, stripped of their honor and dignity, horribly mutilated, and finally killed off in particularly brutal fashions. Without any spoilers, suffice it to say that Martin outdoes himself in this novel with a character actually being eaten WHILE STILL ALIVE. Outstanding. What an excellent way to repay the reader who has invested hours of their life following a character through several books. One is finally forced to ask the question: why should Martin expect us to invest any emotions into these characters at all? For that matter, why does the author? Why write about someone over the course of their lives, describing their trials and tribulations, their hopes and dreams, depicting them fighting overwhelming odds and hardships with honor and courage, only to kill them off in as ignoble and senseless a fashion as can be imagined? I fail to see what possible purpose this serves, other than to feed the fires of an already incredibly fatalistic public mind. In the end, this is Martin's masterpiece and it is completely up to him as to how he dispenses it. However, I for one am saddened that one of the last bastions of American culture fighting against a nearly overwhelming sense of nihilism -- the fantasy genre -- has seemingly fallen at last. Perhaps Martin was not the one who stabbed it in the heart, but here he at least twists the blade. Do we even care enough to mourn?","2005-11-15","United States","","true","23","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29L8QB8BJ9GRF"
"B000FCKGPC","4","The Game Continues Even in War's Aftermath","The War of the Five Kings is all but over with only a few holdouts remaining in the realm, however as Westeros attempts to recover enough before winter hits it appears that more carrion will be on the menu of A Feast for Crows. The fourth installment of George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series shows the ugly aftermath of war which other fantasy epics seemingly ignore after the triumphant conclusion, but as the middle of Martin’s series begins it shows that politics and opportunists use any situation for their advantage. Unlike the first three volumes of the series, Martin divided narrative settings in half with some point-of-view characters appearing in Feast while some had to wait until the fifth volume (A Dance with Dragons). With the focus on the events in southern Westeros, primarily King’s Landing and the Riverlands, the story feels more intimate than grand as the previous volumes did. The fallout of Tywin’s death is felt in King’s Landing the most when Cersei takes control and attempts to outshine her father in governance, yet it caught up getting entrapped within her own web of intrigues. Jaime’s story shows a man looking to redeem himself while taking advantage of his dishonorable reputation in wrapping up the war in the Riverlands. Along with the Lannister siblings, readers followed Arya to Braavos where she happened to interact with a traveling Samwell Tarly headed for Oldtown who on his journey sailed around a conspiracy filled Dorne and saw the effects of events among the Ironborn. Within the untouched Vale finds Sansa Stark under a false name watching as Littlefinger schemes to retain power and set up events for the future. Yet Martin’s best writing is following Brienne of Tarth’s quest to find Sansa in the war ravaged hinterland, showing off the results of war upon the land and the populace which is often avoided in other epic fantasy. While many fans have found the division of the narrative upsetting and following Brienne’s journey annoying, some didn’t realize how much set up Martin was writing for events in the last 40% of A Dance with Dragons as well as the last two books of the series. In the chaos of war’s aftermath just like in battle, anyone can take power and some who thought themselves natural wielders of power are outplayed in the game of thrones. The events in Dorne and the Iron Islands change the completion of the entire series, making it more epic in scale when seen in context of the whole story. One of Martin’s best decisions was to both begin and end in Oldtown with characters introduced in the prologue appearing again at the end from the point-of-view of a favorite character in a sense connecting the whole book together. A Feast for Crows shows the aftermath of war as well as showing that schemes for power never end, especially as a realm tries to put itself together after it was shattered by war. While not as “epic” as the first three volumes of A Song of Ice and Fire, this book is still a fantastic read on why the game never ends.","2016-08-24","United States","","true","24","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMCO6DRLK1TE1"
"B000FCKGPC","5","Incomplete, but the prose is still captivating","First off, I must mention that 'A Feast For Crows' is the fourth book in the 'Song Of Ice And Fire' series, and this series is not one you can read out of order. If you haven't read the first three, you will not have a clue as to what is going on. In order, read 'A Game Of Thrones', 'A Clash Of Kings', and 'A Storm Of Swords' first. Then you will be ready for 'A Feast For Crows'. Also, of the four books out in the 'Song Of Ice And Fire' series, 'A Feast For Crows' is by far the slowest moving. Whereas the previous three books could not be put down, I was able to walk away from 'Feast' several times. Briefly, for those curious fans of Martin's writing and those anxiously awaiting this book, I will try to summarize a bit without giving too much away. The old and accustomed POV character chapters you will find inside 'A Feast For Crows' are Jaime, Samwell, Sansa (now called Alayne as she poses as Littlefinger's [...] daughter), and Arya (also calling herself Cat Of The Canals). The new POV chapters are Queen Cercei, Brienne, Arys Oakheart (chapter: The Soiled Knight), Aeron Greyjoy (known as The Damphair, chapters: The Prophet, The Drowned Man), crippled Prince Doran Martell (chapter: The Captain Of Guards), Asha Greyjoy (chapter: The Kraken's Daughter) Victarian Greyjoy (chapters: The Iron Captain, The Reaver), and Arianne Martell (chapters: The Queenmaker, The Princess In The Tower). Missing, of course, as most reviewers are noting, are Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister (the Imp), Stannis Baratheon, Davos, and Bran and Rickon Stark. In 'A Feast For Crows', some characters change and grow, some deteriorate, and some stay the same. Really, not a lot happens as far as big events or timeline passing until the very end (sorry, I'm not saying what it is!). It just seems that 684 pages, no matter how much I enjoy Martin's writing, is a bit of a long spell for such little development in the bigger story. It felt a bit like an intermission between books 3 and 5. The additional information on the Greyjoy family was great, along with the addition of Cercei as a POV, but many of the others, including Brienne who is in the book a lot, were uninteresting at best. So why five stars? Because Martin's prose is in top form. He can still, simply with words, suck my into a magical time and place where I can breathe the air and smell the corpses hanging from the trees. Although it is so very well written, making it worthy of five stars, it did fail to leave that burning sensation deep in my belly that makes me scream in frustration for the next book to come out. This time, the wait for the next in the series will be much easier, because I am not left with that fiery urge to know more. It seems that publisher and author should have sought for that type of urgency in this book, trimming down the story to a tighter line, and leaving out Brienne, instead of splitting apart the ""Whole Story"". In my humble opinion, that would have been a wiser and more monetarily intelligent decision. If you are a diehard fan, yes, it's worth the money. If you are a lukewarm fan, wait for the paperback. If you are not very excited about the series, then wait for a used paperback. Enjoy!","2005-12-14","United States","","true","25","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PGUZ2CJFHUP7"

"B000FCKGPC","5","Martin continues to defy expectations","If you're new to the series and getting to the book for the first time, perhaps having started after seeing the HBO show, take a moment to consider how the previous book ended. Momentous events, some hopeful and some intensely tragic. A lot to take in, for both readers and characters. A Feast for Crows is a very different beast than A Storm of Swords, but this is all brought on by how A Storm of Swords ended. Several of the POVs are now dealing with the aftermath of what happened in the previous three books and the costs of all that action is now given time to sink in. I was actually quite disappointed when, following A Storm of Swords, we were told that the action would jump ahead five years between books 3 and 4. I felt it would not give readers the time to mourn the deaths and reflect on the events in the previous books since it would be ""old history"" for the characters when we next met them. Given this, I was very pleased to see that the jump ahead was abandoned and that we instead were allowed to follow along as the characters dealt with the events of the prior books. I also feel that GRRM's writing is at its most beautiful and poignant in many of the chapters in A Feast for Crows. Of course, some POVs don't appear at all in this book, and I do think that announcement should probably have been at the front of the book instead of at the end; it is frustrating to wait for a chapter that never shows up and not all readers have the benefit of Internet discussions to inform them in advance. So, do yourself a favour and don't turn page after page waiting for Dany, Jon and Tyrion. You'll see them in the next book. There are several new POVs, some fairly brief, but don't look at them as taking up room that your missing favourite could have had. Look at them as more opportunities of seeing new facets of the story. Its all a giant mosaic and all the pieces matter for the final image. That said, I think one really doesn't have to enjoy all POVs to enjoy the overall story; I definitely have my favourites as well as those that I rarely reread. This is, without a doubt, an even more character-driven book than the previous, but this change of tone and pace is something the series has been building towards, with chapters growing longer and more detailed over the previous books. Some readers are clearly disappointed with the change, but others (myself included) have embraced it. But I don't think it is surprising that a series that hooked readers by being different and defying expectations might lose some of them along the way by continuing to be different and continuing to defy expectations. That has nothing to do with a lack of quality, its all down to personal opinion. In my personal opinion, this was a wonderful read which clearly showed that GRRM is not just a master of shocking plot twists but also a master of characterisation.","2011-08-20","United States","","true","27","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NP23G7NQJM7G"
"B000FCKGPC","4","If you are just starting the series...","... then hold off on A Feast for Crows 'til you have time to go right into A Dance with Dragons. I started the series a few years ago, when it was only three books; it took over my life for the duration. As I also love to listen to books, I read then listened, or listened then read, my way through the incredible world that Mr. Martin created. Crows was published a year later. I decided to wait to read it until Dragons was published, as initially the author (or maybe his agents - but I swear I didn't dream this) implied that it was really the second half of Crows, and would hopefully be out in a year. Five years later, Dragons appeared. All I can say is, I am SO glad I waited. A Feast for Crows is full of character development - though most weren't the characters I'd come to love in the previous books. It also ends very abruptly. I finished it and immediately opened Dragons - if I had read it upon publication, as most loyal fans did, I would have been very disappointed. Crows is also the only book of the series that I didn't feel compelled to both read and hear. If I listened to certain chapters on my iPod, I then skipped them in the book. They really weren't worth revisiting - not my experience with the other books. I really want to give this book 3 1/2 stars, but am upping to 4 largely due to the excellence of the overall series. If possible, I would give the first three books a 6 out of 5 stars. So now we wait for the final two books, and all hope that a decade doesn't pass before the story closes. I read somewhere that the author, acknowledging his age, told the creator of the HBO series how the story ends. I don't know if that's true, but truly it's no solace to me. The tv series is good, and interesting - but obviously can't begin to capture the whole story in 10 episodes. Mr. Martin is the only one who can continue the story, and his vehicle is writing. I want the books. My hope is that Mr. Martin is true to the fans that made his career. We are all certainly true to him - though A Feast for Crows is the least of the series, I still recommend it. I have bought it in book format (2: one each for husband/son); Kindle (me); and Audible (me again). I have done the same for the other four books published so far, and recommend the series to family and friends whenever we talk of books (which is often). And honestly, there are so many fans even more devoted than I. So please Mr. Martin - tell us the story, as only you, with your extraordinary skill, can.","2012-03-15","United States","","true","28","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R458XXS4N96S2"
"B000FCKGPC","4","Flaws obviously tied to publishing device","Feast for Crows is a good book. It's not as lavish or action-packed as its predecessors, but it's not supposed to be - the name is a clear indication of the purpose of this collection. Many more minor (at least at the moment) characters are to be found here, vying with one another for scraps left by the fallout of the huge battles and manuvers we enjoyed in the previous novels. Martin hasn't lost any of his narrative skills, and I continue to keep the faith with his ability to control the pace of the plot - after all, anyone willing to kill off main characters with the speed and perhaps even glee that he does shouldn't have too hard a time chopping off some of the dozens of open plotlines as they get too unwieldy. The real flaws in the novel are tied to the odd publishing tactic of only involving maybe half (or less) of the characters who had their own storylines in the prior novels. Simply put, most of the characters included in Feast for Crows suck. It's a matter of taste, but if you don't really like Cersei, Sansa, Jaime (who was cool once, but is useless now that he lost his hand), Brienne, or Sam (wha?) you are basically SOL. Worse, Arya (one of my favorites) is in this book but only gets about 3 chapters which are well-written but involve almost no action, meaning she'll be nowhere to be seen in the next novel either. Depressing indeed. If you take Feast for Crows like it is: a novel about the scattered leavings of war squabbled over by largely a group of secondary characters, you'll probably enjoy it in that limited scope. Yes, we did wait years and years for a novel that is largely a placeholder while the main characters take a breather, but what can you do. A few other comments: -- I don't think the editing was bad in this book; Martin does repeat himself more than a few times (discussions of Pycelle's missing beard, endless references to the uselessness of nipples on a breastplate, etc.) but it's more of his typical tactic of having different characters ponder mutual events rather than just accidental repetition. -- Martin's weird fascination with rape is in full bloom here, with pretty much every female character major or minor either raped or threatened with it. I can't decide if this adds to the realism of a medieval world or is just creepy. Probably both. All in all, a Feast for Crows is better than most of the other literary fare out there, even if it spends most of its time dealing with characters that we previously thought just hung around to give the real characters someone to interact with. Expect lots of politicizing, a little bit of magic, and no real fighting and you'll be on target.","2005-11-29","United States","","true","29","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RJYPQBOBKDPD"
"B000FCKGPC","3","A Feast for the UnNamed","After reading the first 3 installments of ""A Song of Ice and Fire,"" I didn't feel the need to write any reviews on Amazon. The story thus far had been compelling, creative, and the characters were brilliant. Then, I read AFFC and everything changed. While AFFC is not a bad book, it just leaves the readers wondering where the story is going and why Martin chose to focus on SO many unnamed characters. Obviously it doesn't take a genius to recognize the complexity of this story, the relationship between the characters, and so on. Still, do we need an entire chapter dedicated the Prince of Dorn's daughter locked in a tower? Up until this 4th installment no one had given a second thought to these characters and seldom remembered references made of these them in ASOS. AFFC is also loaded with words and words of meaningless description and babble. It's not the longest book in the series, although it definitely has that feel. Now, I just ripped the book apart and you're wondering why I gave the book 3 stars? As a reader, you still have to keep in perspective that this is the middle of the story (along with Dance of Dragons, which I haven't read yet) and until the story is complete it's difficult to accurately assess the significance of these unnammed POVs. Aside from the unnamed POV chapters, the primary characters of Cersie, Jamie, Arya, and Sansa are overall good reads. I know some people complained that Cersie dominated the book, but I thoroughly enjoyed her chapters. Cersie is the ultimate antagonist of the series. She's conniving, self consumed, and paranoid and will stop at nothing to ensure the her son's reign and her emergence as queen. We knew all of this from the start of the series and so it's only natural that GRRM gave her so much attention in this book. Having read the previous installments, I frequently wondered why Cersie did not have POV chapters. Jamie's perspectives add much needed levity to the story, as he's now coping with being the most feared and loathed knight in Westeros... with only one hand. He also grows and matures through the story, as he realizes his non-worth as a warrior and more importantly to his ""sweet sister,"" which leaves him to make an uncharacteristic decision at the close of his POV. Arya has the coolest POV chapters as she an apprentice at the Guild of Faceless Men, which she has been led to after her encounter with Jaqen H'ghar. Most of her chapters focus on her taking on a new identify as Cat of the Canals (be warned when you see that POV chapter name), as she learns how to lie and attempts to change her face. You get the sense that GRRM is setting up something mystical for Arya by the way her POV ends. Sansa has some interesting POV chapters. She resides at the Vale as Little Finger's captive ""natural daughter,"" going by the name Alayne through most of the book to hide her identity from King's Landing. Through Alayne POV you get the sense that Little Finger is rising up to power and sometimes you even feel like he's going to end up taking over the whole kingdom ;-) Still, there's too much focus on the needy little lord Robert Arryn and Alayne's struggles to function as his mother-figure. Then there's Brienne... I don't know where to start, but I'll keep it very simple. Her character is roaming aimlessly in search for Sansa Stark on the oath she swore to Cat Stark. You as the reader know exactly where Sansa is being held, but Brienne is never on the right path and it's downright frustrating at times. However, her characters gets a fair amount of action and her POV has an eerie ending. The Ironmen chapters are the exception to the unnamed POVs, as they focus on the birth of a new leader Euron Greyjoy, also known as ""The Crow's Eye."" Euron is the younger brother of Balon Greyjoy who dies at the beginning of the book. The Crow's Eye is feared by his ironmen, siblings, but wins their liege by promising them reign over entire kingdom and convinces them to follow him in search of dragons. You get a strong sense of doom awaiting Dany in the upcoming book. Overall, you have to take AFFC for what's it's worth. It's the middle of the story. There are no big battles and no main character gets beheaded. The focal aforementioned characters have interesting POVs that are developing quite nicely and The Crow's Eye is definitely a great villain. However, it's extremely difficult getting past the some of the unnamed POV chapters and the fact that none of the main character chapters get resolved. Hopefully GRRM doesn't take 5 years to release the next installment after A Dance with Dragons, as I fear some fans may lose interest.","2011-11-23","United States","","true","30","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZIISTP9YIH3K"

"B000FCKGPC","4","Not the book you deserve, but the book you need to get to DwD.","A feast for Crows has been given a lit of mixed reviews, so much so that i almost decided not to purchase it. I would like to start this off by telling you that not getting this because of the reviews would be a huge error. I agree that this book was the weakest of the first four, but only because it has to be. Let me explain: As we all know, Thrones was a beautiful book. it was a classic. great characters, good plot, lots of nice figurative language. If you got this far in the series it is because you saw something in Thrones that you knew was a once in a lifetime series. I think everyone can agree on that. It's after that book that things become less fact and more opinion. In the rand scheme of things, Thrones was the exposition and inciting incident in the Song of Ice and Fire series. Kings, in my opinion; was more of a teaser than anything else. He introduced a lot more characters, and without spoiling anything, divided Westeros up in the fallout of the first book. Kings was a solid entry. It was not as good as Thrones. Nor was it as good as Swords, but it was not flawed in any way. Simply put, Kings was the Rising Action in the series, a crucible, which is intersting for a short while, but then you start to focus on ""what comes next"" and get bored with the task at hand. Then came Swords. For me, Swords was the best of the first four books in the series. It was all fallout following Kings, and it was basically one huge conflict and climax to the first two books. The climax is usually the most action packed most involved section of any plot, and Swords followed that to a tee. That is why Swords is so highly acclaimed; it was fortunate enough to be the portion of the series everyone was waiting for, the portion everyone was prepared for. But then we get to Crows, and it's nothing like the preceeding three books. that is becuase Crows is the falling action, the last few pages after the climax that you never actually planned on reading. In a usual book, ten to fifteen pages of faling action are bearable. But when you stretch that for hundreds of pages, people get agitated, and bored. Fortunatly, about 50% in the book really pcks up in anticipation of Dragons, and you are wisked out of the land of falling action and into the world of rising action and conflict all over again.

"B000FCKGPC","4","A Feast of a Novel","I came into [book:A Feast for Crows|13497] regarding it as a sort of ""hump book"". A speed bump, if you will. The book that I needed to get through in order to get to the next book in the series. With that outlook, I put off reading book four in the Song of Ice and Fire series, better known as Game of Thrones, for quite sometime. I knew that my favorites and other regulars wouldn't really feature in book four. Jon Snow and Jamie Lannister are seen only briefly through the eyes of Sam Tarly and Brienne of Tarth. Arya and Sansa are present, but only barely, with very light story arcs throughout the novel. And Dany and Tyrion are no where to be found, except when mentioned in conversation or in the dreams of a certain Queen. Of course, once I started reading, none of that seemed to matter much. [author:George R.R. Martin|346732] is such a master story teller that I was drawn in completely to his narratives. Some of the standouts of book four are: Samwell Tarly - sent from Castle Black to the Citadel to forge his maester's chain and, perhaps, to help a certain dragon queen in the process. He also gets in a little romance along the way. Cersei Lannister - a paranoid and self-righteous Queen Regent, ruling Kings Landing with an iron fist and bad judgement calls. Her main goals are searching for Tyrion though out the kingdom and inventing a way to dispose of Queen Margaery. She surrounds herself with men and women she knows she can control and thinks that she is truly in charge, but you can see the hole she is digging for herself, even if she can't. Cersei is one of the strongest narratives in the book. Brienne of Tarth - with Jamie's charge to find the Stark girls and return them to safety, Brienne sets out on an almost impossible quest, with Pod at her side as her squire and confidant. She follows several leads that ultimately bring her back full circle to the first oath that she swore to Lady Stark to bring her daughters home. Brienne may just be the star of book four. There are other narratives as well, concerning certain characters in Dorne and The Iron Islands. While it may not be my favorite book in the series, it was still an engrossing read and has set up many suspenseful elements to come in [book:A Dance with Dragons|10664113] I liked [book:A Feast for Crows|13497] far more than I thought I would and I give it four stars.","2014-07-06","United States","","true","34","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23R2PPMUFJ626"
"B000FCKGPC","4","Goes everywhere and nowhere","Standing alone, A Feast for Crows would be for most of us a two-star book at best. The four star rating here reflects an admittedly hopeful perspective in which this story serves to advance the plot lines, characters, and themes that many excellent reviewers have described very well and which are the main attractions for most readers of this (thus far) powerful series. A Feast for Crows, in and of itself, is a truly unrewarding read. Little occurs that is either interesting or apparently significant in the present moment. The story is seemingly simply a chronicle of incidents with little sound or fury, and signifying... well, hopefully we will find out in a later volume. Much of the novel is remarkably unpleasant in every respect. Martin's ability to create characters who are not one-dimensional (all good or all evil) has been much lauded and is in evidence here, but most of the book is devoted to people of diverse affiliations who are unremittingly unpleasant. Many are physically ugly, and a fairly large number get maimed and become uglier still. The sites visited are similarly dominated by dark, damp, ruined places. Most of what happens turns on acts of violence, betrayal, cruelty, and malice, and little good comes to anyone. Churning through endless pages focused on these things makes for a really oppressive experience not so much because we need the ""good guys"" to clobber the ""bad guys"" -- seeing preferred characters experience defeat is one of the surprisingly powerful aspercts of the earlier books, and I think most readers can handle that -- but when all the gloom leads us nowhere at all, then it really is just gloom. Like some other reviewers, I found the book to be annoying, boring, pointless (taken on its own), and powerfully unpleasant. So -- why four stars? Well, my hope and reasonable expectation is that this volume is setting up something else, and that all of the above will set the table for movement, excitement, and ultimately the strong emotional and conceptual provocations that most of us believe Martin can accomplish. As I read A Feast for Crows, my own assumption was that Martin is trying to parallel life, where protracted periods in which nothing big happens, nothing is learned or made clear, etc., can slowly unfold as incremental, seemingly invisible little things eventually cause the balance to tip, and an explosion of action to follow. That's my hope, and it's why I read this book. Otherwise, I would surely have set it as a pointless, oppressive, unrewarding read.","2011-10-19","United States","","true","35","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21RHMB9O5PJGT"
"B000FCKGPC","4","It's all about the Journey...","*Potential Minor Spoilers*. After completing Book 3 (Kindle Edition), I was naturally keen to continue with Book 4. Book 4 actually concludes with a message from George R R Martin, but it's worth paraphrasing it here to set the context of Book 4. Book 4 and Book 5 represent events occurring concurrently in different geographic locations (but Book 5 then gets past the concurrent events and continues its own run). Book 4 is primary concerned with events ""around"" Kings Landing. In Book 4 you won't be reading anything of what happens to Tyrion, or what's happening at the Wall. I had a sense of feeling lost at the beginning of Book 4 because it starts in a new location with a whole new set of characters. And then that's the last you hear of those characters for 700 or 800 pages. It's only in the last couple of chapters of Book 4 that we get to learn how these new characters fit into the overall storyline. After that the focus tends to shift back to Cersei, Jamie, Brienne, Arya, Sam, and some others I won't mention. Book 4 is not without its plotting and scheming, but a substantial portion of the book concerns itself with what might be considered ""minutiae"" in terms of the characters. Some people will no doubt complain (or at least consider) much of this minutiae to be boring and unnecessary, but to me it is part of George Martin's writing style and the pace of the book would feel very different without it. Personally I found Book 4 easier to ""get into"" than Book 3. On the other hand, there are also quite a few ""key events"" that occur in Book 4 and for some of these alone it is worth reading. On the negative side, it's just as well Book 5 is already published, because there are at least 3 ""cliffhanger"" events in Book 4 that I can think of that are not resolved by the end of the Book, which have certainly propelled me to continue on with Book 4. The other negative is that there were a number of typos (or what appeared to be typos) in the book. Considering the length of the book, it's nothing unforgivable, but I note them because I find them somewhat ""jarring"" when I am ""in the zone"" and really absorbed in the book.","2014-08-02","United States","","true","36","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ITPDSP2IAI70"
"B000FCKGPC","4","four-star volume in five-star (?) epic","Four stars -- not bad. I am a pretty tough grader. To get 5 stars from me you have to border on perfection -- as the first three volumes of this series did. Most readers will be painfully aware that this volume has been a bit of a struggle for Mr Martin; and unfortunately, some of that struggle shows. The breadth and complexity of the story are possibly becoming a bit much for the author, as well as his readers to handle. There may have been signs of winding down story lines and eliminating characters a bit precipitously to make room for newer ones (but of course we can never be sure...) and the story lines are becoming so numerous and divergent that it is becoming difficult to deal with even a subset of them all satisfactorily in a single volume. I have to agree with the reviewer who hoped that one day we will see a ""director's cut"" of the material in this volume and the next, rearranged in the originally-intended order and spread out across as many volumes as physically necessary. With the example of Robert Jordan before us (his _Eye of the World_ might have been another of my five-star books, if not for the direction -- or lack of same! -- the rest of the Wheel of Time series has taken), many of us are too quick to assume that Mr Martin is abusing his readers' good will the way Mr Jordan has. But no, Mr Martin still appears to be making a good-faith effort to deliver on the promise of the earlier volumes in the series. There does not seem to be anything gratuitous here; all the pieces seem to be meat, not fat. I do not recall anything that did not contribute to the whole, or anything I would nominate to be cut. In fact, if anything, Mr Martin and his editors may have cut useful prose that would have helped bring to mind minor characters when they reappear on the stage. Back in my youth, when a fat trilogy was considered an epic, it was a sophomoric truism that a letdown was to be expected in the middle volume, when all the divergent story lines had been laid out and none had yet begun to be brought back together for their ultimate resolution. Maybe that 'wisdom' remains valid, only the letdown occurs in the middle volume of a planned heptology! But please remember, Mr Martin, that a great beginning does not make a great work. I am desperately hoping that when all is said and done, you will have given us a five-star epic.","2006-01-21","United States","","true","37","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RIKOFW0X1UKP"
"B000FCKGPC","4","Not as good as the last books, but still great","Warning: This review has spoilers from the first three books. Don't read if you don't want to be spoiled on A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, or A Storm of Swords! Alright, a lot of people are really mad about this book. People are mad that their favorite characters are no where to be seen, people are mad that the boring characters get more attention, and people are mad about the lack of action. While it is definitely no Storm of Swords, I still thought Feast for Crows was a really great book. It wasn't as straightforward as the previous books, and it didn't have much action at all. But I think it had a lot of really good moments, and really gave the story a sense of realism and development from characters you don't normally see. The thing about Martin's books is that you don't know for sure who is right or wrong, and you don't know who is going to live or die. I feel like this book is a story of the ""other side."" You get a lot more chapters about Cersie and Jaime, and seemingly unimportant characters like Brienne and characters from Dorne. You get less Starks, less Snows, less Tyrion, less of the people you love. But that's ok. Because there are (mostly) no good guys or bad guys, and every character has a story. Think of Feast for Crows like a new book; you didn't know how awesome Jon Snow was or Eddard Stark or Tyrion or anyone until you actually got into Game of Thrones. They were all new to you, and none of them had any significance. Now that you've grown to love them, you are mad to see them practically disappear. New ones are being introduced, characters that have no meaning to you. Just know that these characters will. They develop, they grow, and they get just as awesome as your favorites (well, most of them do). Give them a chance, and you'll learn to love them. Your favorite characters from before get their stories told in the next book, don't worry. I give it a 4/5, while I would have given the others 5/5. I think it's not as great as the others, but still really good. Give it a chance, the characters are still as awesome as before, they are just new.","2012-01-13","United States","","true","38","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39TPH33FNBUTB"
"B000FCKGPC","5","If you're prewarned, there is much to love here...","Thank the seven that I read the reviews to ""A Feast for Crows"" before I read the book; they set my expectations so low that only a total disaster would have disappointed me. I started out HATING ""Songs of Fire and Ice""...I couldn't stand all the minor characters with their dumb backstories, and the heraldry and Ser this and Ser that...until I got to about page 100 in the first book. Once I ""got"" what Martin was going for I was totally hooked and didn't stop reading until I was done with the four books. Then I got the fantasy flight card game, and started the HBO series, but that's another story... Anyway, I can imagine if I'd had to wait years and years for A Feast For Crows to come out, and then wait another 8 years (or whatever) for the 5th book to show up, I would have been mortally wounded and frustrated. However, I'm a late comer to this world, and I just finished the 4th book and the 5th is coming out in a matter of weeks. Ok, this really isn't about me, what I'm trying to say is that a new reader to the series isn't going to hate the 4th book as much as someone who was there from the beginning. I love just hanging around in Martin's world, and if the machinations of the Dornish (creating yet ANOTHER regent to go to war over! genius!) and Cersei's cold-war with the Tyrells, and Arya's stay at the House of Black and White, and Brienne's adventures in her search for Sansa, and Littlefinger's fight with the Lords Declarant don't move the story along enough, well heck the 5th book will be out soon! I'm the last person I though would be defending this book, but reading them all at once gives a different perspective than having to wait an increasing number of years between tomes. So if you're new to this as I am, don't be afraid of ""A Feast for Crows"". It's a pretty darned enjoyable read. Like everyone else, I'm looking forward to all the Tyrion and Dany chapters in the next one! PS: Martin has to be the most patient writer in the history of writing. If I'd been writing ""Song of Ice and Fire"", I would have had the OTHERS all over the place. somehow, he has managed to show them only a couple of times (though people invoke them as a curse on almost every page) since we saw one battle Waymar Royce in the first pages of the first novel.

"B000FCKGPC","3","It's mainly filler and could be written in half as many words","NB: You should have read the first three books prior to reading this review. Summary: The weakest book in the series, though not necessarily a bad book. Lots (too many) of new characters, many of whom seem redudant/uninteresting. Pages per chapter rate is too high. The book gets better as you move through it, but does not come close to Storm of Swords. Even before I read into this book's development, I could tell that it was a poorly planned book. In the previous three, Martin's writing always feels as though it has a purpose. You can tell the story is going somewhere, even if you can't tell where. The twists come, but they are not cheap twists. They fit into the context of the story and you can understand characters' motivations. In this book, several twists come to mind that make me think, ""why?"". Perhaps I will find out in the next book (I have not read it yet). In general, though, the chapters and the story seem to be moving without purpose. Sure, things happen, but they are not especially exciting. Part of this problem can be traced to the characters. About 2/3 of the perspectives are new; this would not be a problem if these were perspectives of characters we had seen very often. Three of them, I believe, have never appeared in the books aside from descriptions or references. Several others we have met briefly. Too many are unfamiliar. Some are introduced and then disappear for long stretches of the book. And then there is Cersei. By far, she takes up the most room in this book. Martin has done a good job of casting unlikable characters in a sympathetic light once we are introduced to their perspective. We may still dislike them, but we understand their motivations better. So, I was interested to get a look into Cersei's mind. Unfortunately, she is just as one-dimensional in this book as she is in the others. The big reveal, where we learn what motivates her, comes slowly and isn't fully realized until near the end of the book, but it's fairly disappointing. That's why she is how she is? Martin also uses this bizarre naming convention for his chapters, whereby some characters are referred to by their name, some by their title, some by their alias, and some by a random descriptor. So, Arya has assumed about 10 different names throughout the books thus far, but suddenly her chapters are renamed to fit the name she takes in this book. You'll meet a new character in Dorne, the captain of Prince Doran's Guards, so he is called the The Captain of the Guards. Meanwhile, Jaime, who is now the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, is still just Jaime. Then there is another character is described at one point with a reference to her current situation. That is, every other chapter name (alias, given name, title) could be considered a proper title to be used in greeting the character, with one exception. Why? I don't know. Oh, they change throughout the book. So, you meet a ton of new characters and then when you reach their second or third chapter have to spend a paragraph discrerning who this chapter is about. The most glaring example of this is found in the second half of the book when the alias used as the chapter name fits two different characters. And yet the book is still good, as far as books go. Some of the new perspectives are interesting, picking up storylines from book three that you hoped would not be dropped. I have heard people say they do not enjoy Arya's chapters as much in this book, but I still found her to be as interesting as ever. Meanwhile, and this is a testament to Martin's writing as I wouldn't have imagined this in the first book, Sansa is starting to rival Arya as one of my favorite characters. The book hits it's high water mark near the end in a quite unlikely place. You will know it when you get there as a smile might creep across your face.","2013-01-09","United States","","true","40","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2858ZK84XRLDU"

"B000FCKGPC","3","By Far The Worst Book In The Series (But Should Still Be Read)","I have previously read and reviewed the first three books of the now-classic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire, by George R.R. Martin, for this blog: A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords. A Feast for Crows is considered by some the red-headed step child of the series so far because even though it is the most critically recognized entry in the series (nominated for the Hugo, Locus and British Fantasy Society awards although notably it failed to win any of these) it is also the book in the series which is rated the lowest by actual readers. There's a definite reason for this. A Feast for Crows was first published nearly 5 years after the publication of 2000's A Storm of Swords and the expectations of Martin's burgeoning fan base were extremely high. A Feast for Crows became the first book in the series to debut as #1 on the New York Times bestseller list and be an international publishing phenomenon. This is somewhat surprising, because several of the most popular characters from the series do not make an appearance in A Feast for Crows. Martin structures his novels as series of chapters with intersecting and overlayed points-of-views from specific characters on the same series of events. Because A Feast for Crows grew so gigantic during the five years Martin spent writing it, at some point he decided to concentrate on some of the less popular (some would say more villainous) characters in A Feast for Crows and push the perspectives of the more popular characters (Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen to name a few) into the still-to-be-written A Dance with Dragons (which despite this headstart still took an agonizing 6 years to be published). You'd think that the 4th entry in a series which has been decreed to be no longer than 7 books long would be concentrating on reducing the scope of the story not expanding it. If you thought that you'd be wrong, because Martin introduces several new characters who of course come with their own plots and allegiances which somehow link up to the previously revealed plots and allegiances like a slowly growing intricate spider-web or moss spreading inch by inch over a stone tomb. The theme of the book is about power, and of course we all know absolute power corrupts absolutely. The anti-heroine of the series, Cersei Lannister Barratheon is now fully ascendant at the seat of power in King's Landing, although due to the inherent sexism (some would say misogyny) of the culture she is not officially crowned and of course does not sit on The Iron Throne, as her husband and sons have. Cersei is the kind of character readers love to hate and Martin puts her in her place somewhat, saving the coup de grace for the next book, we hope. The plots are too numerous to summarize here, but suffice it to say that the conflict which has animated the first three books, the War of the Five Kings is quickly hurtling to a conclusion and this book is about what people do after the war is over, and how the ""winners"" and ""losers"" are both affected in its aftermath. The one good thing about Martin pushing all the story lines of the favorite characters into A Dance with Dragons is that it makes that book an even more desirable read, and one that I will try to review shortly. Despite the slight lull that A Feast for Crows represents in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, it still points out how salient the stories and characters that Martin has created that even the secondary characters make for a compelling read, and promise that the next book should be even more so.

"B000FCKGPC","3","Tasty, But Not Filling","After reading some of the reviews that compared this book to the demise in writing that happened with Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, I was almost afraid to crack the cover. For anyone that has managed to keep up with Jordan's fated series, you have a good idea of just how bad writing can get, and just how low a once good series can fall. In fact, I would say that book 10 of the Wheel of Time series is probably the worst book that I have ever read (fiction or non-fiction). Fortunately, having just finished ""A Feast for Crows"", I can say that although the book is not on the same level as the first 3 books of the series, it is still an OK read. I enjoyed the first 3 books so much that I pre-ordered this one before it could be reviewed. I will not make that mistake again. I would advise getting a copy form the local library unless you need it for your collection. I don't think we should reward the writer and publisher for less than quality work. Having said that, Martin is a very good writer (several levels above Robert Jordan), and even one of his poorer works is an entertaining and worthwhile read. Of course, as Martin points out in the end of the book some characters are left out of this book, because he felt it would be better to ""tell the entire story for half the characters, rather than tell half the story for all the characters"". But, isn't telling part of the story for all the characters exactly what he has been doing in the first 3 books? Doesn't that really define what a series is about? The whole story is not complete until the last book. It is very hard to pick up on a character that is completely skipped in one book, and that you don't hear from for 2-5 years. Some of the characters that were covered in this book were ""over cooked"". Many of these pages could have been spared to keep us up to date with those not covered. I liked Brienne, the girl knight in the other books, but we had to follow her around through so many useless ramblings in this book that by the end I was hoping she could just die a valiant death and be finished. I also got very sick of Cersei. She got way too much press in this book. I think that Martin had managed to establish Cersei as a self-centered, self-serving, evil bitch in the other books. That image was beaten to death in this book. In addition, Martin also made Cersei an insane drunkard, just in case we needed some extra ammunition to hate her. I got to the point that I dreaded seeing her name on the chapter heading. I knew that it would just be more of her scheming, evil plans, and stupid political moves. Many of Cersei's schemes never seemed to go anywhere, but just filled page after page after page. At least Cersei's last chapter was satisfying. Too many pages seemed to go to establishing characters that were already well established, without advancing the story line. In fact, the story seemed to get side-tracked in this book, and ended up meandering around, but not getting very far. If this book were a pie, you would find that the crust (Cersei, Brienne, etc.,) to be burnt, while the center of the pie (Arya, Jon, etc.) was under-cooked and still cold. If you taste the pie you find that the cook has forgotten some of the key ingredients in the recipe (Tyrion, Dany, etc.). You can eat a slice, but you will not desire seconds. I read that Martin originally planned for this series to be 3 books. That number grew to 4, then 6, and now I have heard that it will take at least 7 to finish it. If the next book is anything like this one, seven may be a conservative number.","2006-01-13","United States","","true","44","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLBXZJKB94HI"
"B000FCKGPC","5","Five stars for the book, four for the cover, three for the author and two for the publishers","The book: This book is great, as everything George R. R. Martin writes is. True, there is less action in it then in previous books, but that's because the war has wound down and mow there are reinforcements at the wall to defend it from others. But still, there is not one boring page in this book. It is a fantastic addition to the Song of Ice and Fire, and everyone giving it one and two star reviews because they're pissed that their favorite character wasn't in it is acting like a spoiled baby.Yes, I miss some of them too, and I would have loved to read about Bran, Tyrion, and Jon Snow but as readers, we take what the author can give, and a Dance With Dragons is already half way done. I'm not happy about the wait, but wait I will. The chapters in this book are divided up as follows (not in order of progression) Aeron (Damphair) Greyjoy (2) Asha Greyjoy (1) Victarion Greyjoy (2) Areo Hotha, captain of the prince of Dorne's guards (1) Arianne Martell, Princess of Dorne (2) Ser Arys Oakheart, Kingsgaurdman in Dorne (1) Cersei Lannister, Queen Regent (10) Jamie Lannister, Captain of the Kingsgaurd (7) Brienne, Maid of Tarth (8) Arya Stark/Cat of the canals (3) Sansa Stark/Alayne (3) Samwell Tarly (5) The Cover: It's just not as nice as the beautifully illustrated covers of the past books. The Author: yes, I'm a little angry that George R. R. Martin couldn't pull together the whole book in time for publication, but even if he had they would have split in two for money reasons, and because would just be too long. Still, I don't see any reason why everyone needs to think Martin is headed the way of Robert Jordon (not that I've read the wheel of time, but apparently it just goes on and on...) he will finish the series in seven books instead of six, and I seriously doubt anyone who vowed not to by a dance With Dragons will actually do so. The publishers: They suck. I want the other half of the story. I do understand the need for profit though, and I'll buy all the remaining books in this series the day they come out. I can not wait for a Dance With Dragons. So even though the publication of this book had its problems, it's still a five star novel in a five star series. And the other half will be out soon. I just may head back and read 1-4 again in the meantime.

"B000FCKGPC","3","Indeed different from the previous books...","Most have already heard of how the book was divided. For those curious, here's a breakdown of exactly which character POVs and how many chapters of each there are: Aeron Greyjoy (2) Asha Greyjoy (1) Victarion Greyjoy (2) Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne (1) Arianne Martell (2) Ser Arys Oakheart (1) Sansa (3) note: she's listed as both Sansa and Alayne Samwell (5) Jaime (6) Brienne (8) Cersei (10) As you can see, GRRM was correct in saying he is focusing on King's Landing. Some people complain of the introduction of new characters, but I think this can be justified by the fact that GRRM has killed off a few of the lead characters in the previous novels and by replacing them, maintains his format of using several POVs to depict an event. Even though there are one or two chapters for each Greyjoy character (as compared to Cersei's ten) they can be linked together to show the storyline in the area, likewise with Martell. However, because the shortness of each character's story, there is not as much emotional investment as there are with characters such as Arya, Tyrion, Catelyn, etc. Personally he could've made this shorter. I was satisfied with the relative frequency of Asha and Theon's appearances in the previous book and how it was sufficient for describing what was happening with that House. It was discouraging and boring to read the first chapter (after the prologue) and find out it was about an unfamiliar character. Also the event with Arianne Martell does not seem necessary and far from significant to this series' history. It was the most interesting in previous books when Sansa was getting her ideals crushed but now she's just learning a couple of things. There's a strange tension between her and Petyr that she never addresses, which is frustrating. Her storyline is one of the slow-paced ones, including Samwell and Brienne. GRRM goes the most in depth with Cersei and Jaime. At first I was rooting against Cersei, but then towards the end, I almost wanted to root for her (this coming from the person who wishes the Coyote would get the Roadrunner every once in awhile). I love the progression of the change in Jaime's character and especially learning more about his past. A compensation for the slow-paced storylines, including Brienne and Samwell, is that a lot of the character's history comes out in flashbacks or reflecting on memories inside the character's head, which I find changes my sympathy and makes the character a more conflicted persona. That, and as a previous reviewer said, the lack of exciting events can be due to the lull in the wars, relatively speaking, and people are dealing with the aftermath etc. However, I'm disappointed that when Arya is mostly shoved away doing her training, there could've been more detail, small events that she goes through and learns something. Anyways, the intrigue is still there (though mostly with Cersei), the writing style is still there, but the pace has slowed with the focus more on the development of the characters themselves than the events. I still enjoyed reading the book, and after a few chapters, it was hard to put down. Definately for fans, just try not to make your expectations high (though it probably won't be after reading reviews) as well as try not to focus on what you're missing. I don't recommend anyone new to this series to start anywhere but the very first book, A Game of Thrones. Note: In the previous book, there was a shocking cliffhanger with Catelyn and I'm really disappointed that in this book, he didn't go very far with it--in fact he barely touches on it.","2005-11-24","United States","","true","46","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23BZI4NODN3H9"
"B000FCKGPC","3","Martin overestimates his minor characters","This book was hard to get through. At times it felt like school reading where i was reading just to get through it as opposed to enjoying it like i did the previous three books. The problem Martin has here is he completely overestimates how interesting and meaningful his minor characters in fact are. By minor in this case i mean Cersei, Brienne, Samwell and so forth. Yes they have major parts to play but they are not the main characters of the overall story. The annoying part about this book is that nearly half of it is divided between Cersei and Brienne and they both seem to have the exact same personal conflict driving their narrative. Both struggle with the fact they are strong women trying to fit in a mans role and are forced to suffer a lack of respect their peers would never receive. Simply put Brienne and Cersei's story lines are boring. Cercei spends the entire book scheming and plotting on the small council and it feels like a really poor political storyline. Nothing happens that couldn't have been told to other characters by ravens. Brienne's stroyline is even worse. Her entire arc is made redundant by the fact she is searching for a character who we know the location and situation of so there is no mystery to it. She plods around and like cersei we could have just learned of her actions in other more plot-forwarding stories. This book is not a complete loss however. Jaime's story may not be brimming with great plot but his character development helps save his portion of the story while the heart of Samwell's story is engaging. Arya's brief appearance whets the appetite but it only points out the glaring problem of having the major characters absent. Sansa's story doesn't do much either and isn't particularly worth mentioning. The Ironmen save this book from a two or one star review, though their storyline isn't perfect. For me i would have preferred if Martin had of made a decision and told their story from a single point of view, but he decided to give Asha, Victarion and Aeron their own chapters. For me Victarion was the best addition to the series in this book as his mixture of loyalty/tradition/honor is so twisted its hard to see where the noble fighter gives way to the vicious killer. i would have preferred to see the iron islands through his eyes as opposed to a fractured experience. I wish Martin had of stuck to his original plan which was to return with his fourth book having followed a five year gap in the story. This would have made a great sense as the third felt like a great end to the first part of the story. In the end he decided to fill in the five year gap and its noticeable that he has no story here for the most part. Feast of Crows is a book about moving pieces around the board, getting them ready for the final act of the story, but most moves are unnecessarily detailed. The book could delete the entire Brienne and Cersei storyline, have updates for them in other characters POV chapters and the book would not suffer. In fact it would not be as hard to read.","2012-07-16","United States","","true","47","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NHAU4Y1CFRUL"

I came to dread the Arya POVs focused on her time in a Braavos funeral parlor engaged in super-tedious kung-fu identity sessions with a ""kindly man."" Her sessions with Syrio Forel were a lot more fun. Some new POVs are the best yet though, like the brilliantly nuanced one in which Jaime reveals his depths by questioning himself as he confronts his past and the consequences of his actions, much like the Hound does in the previous book. And there's the Brienne POV with the story of her quest with her squire Podrick, a pairing that is just as entertaining and heartwarming as the one between Dunk and Egg. Unfortunately, their plotline just gets twisted out of shape at the end of the book with the insertion of a ludicrous anime-style, cliched zombie-seeking-vengeance narrative. And that is the end of that. No more Brienne and Podrick (except for a fleeting glance of Brienne at the end of the next book). I wonder if Martin simply dreads coming back to this story, having realized at some point that the zombie out of nowhere damaged it beyond repair by yanking it in a direction that just takes all the air out of it. It was such a great story too! So the 3 rating is for spite.

"B000FCKGPC","4","Martin succeeds to bring reality to fantasy","A Feast for Crows, book #4 in the ""Song of Ice and Fire"" series is a great work of English literature and continued Martin's great writing. The book is a good transition after all the action of the first three books, Martin in sort of an ""Act IV"" calms things down, explains things and looks back and looks ahead into his wonderful ""Song of Ice and Fire."" The books focuses on on the goings on in ""King's Landing, Dorne and the Iron Islands."" The weakness of this book is no one cares about Dorne or the Iron Islands. The Iron Islanders are nothing more than Vikings, and the Dornish are extremely boring and backwords. Dorne is the weakest of all the seven kingdoms and the most boring. The Dornish sort of remind me of the American Southwest going from New Mexico to California the food, climate and ethnicity reminds me of Pre Colombian America. A great addition to the story. The writing is smooth and flawless. The look into Cersei's psyche is amazing and the tribute, the book has a real feel of Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales."" The Septon traveling with Brienne and Podrick really tells you the average life during the ""Dark Ages"" and the misery and plight of common life during that time. Also the Arya stories have a real ""Charles Dickens"" feel. The Martin is a smart as he is sly. The book is the after math of the War of the Five Kings and Westeros is healing and preparing for winter. The Boltons control the north, the Freys the riverlands, Queen of Mean Cersei rules in King's Landing and the Dornish are working to get back in the ""Game of Thrones."" The book is very essential to character devlopment and actually made ""A Dance with Dragons"" more tolerable. Cersei's development is light year ahead of Dany's in ""Dance with Dragons."" Also it introduces a new villain a man very powerful and very evil Euron ""Crow's Eye"" Greyjoy . . he's as evil as Roose Bolton and Cersei Lannister.

"B000FCKGPC","3","I miss Ned Stark...","As a fan of the first three books, I was greatly looking forward to continuing the story. Martin is fearless when it comes to his characters. I would love to tell you more, but seriously, I don't want to deny you the shock of reading it yourself. Let me simply say that when it comes to Martin's writing, nothing is safe. But now I think that his fearlessness has worked against him. As Publishers Weekly put it, this book is not so much a continuation of the first three books, but is rather the start of a whole new era. It might be better described as A Song of Ice and Fire Part Two: Book One. The characters that we have grown close to are surprisingly not present. The reason for this, according to Martin, is because the manuscript became so long for this book that he decided to split it into two books. A Feast for Crows and Book Five: A Dance with Dragons occur simultaneously, but are split geographically. Still, this wouldn't have phased me if I had more interest in the characters present in this volume. A Feast features the familiar point of view style that Martin has embraced, where each chapter is seen from the perspective of a different character. In this book, we see the story from the eyes of Cersei Lannister, Brienne of Tarth, Jaime the Kingslayer, Samwell Tarly, Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, and a few others that we've never really heard from (Or can remember. I can't wrap my head around all the characters in these books. I mean, kudos to George for having such a large world filled with many inhabitants, but I can't keep my Tarlys straight from my Martells). It comes down to a matter of personal taste, but these are my least favorite characters. Recommendation: First, the obvious. If you haven't read the first three books, don't read this. Read them first. With that in mind, I say that if you enjoyed the beginning of the series, give this one a shot. This will be the book that helps you decide whether or not to continue reading. I chose to do so, and I have at this time finished A Dance with Dragons (a review of that will be coming soon). I gave this one three stars. Why three? Three because I enjoy the series and want to continue reading it. Not four or five though, because this book just wasn't as entertaining as the previous three. While I understand that at this stage Martin is building groundwork for what comes next, I can't help but look back to A Game of Thrones. In that book, which was the first in the series, there was no groundwork. It was all groundwork, yet I couldn't get enough of it! Perhaps the problem is that so much has happened, so much needs to be resolved, and the world has grown larger and larger, therefore making it extremely difficult to write a manuscript that isn't so large the reader couldn't lift it.","2012-11-07","United States","","true","52","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36N84VRDXCKF7"
"B000FCKGPC","3","A Lengthy Incomplete Trip","For a while I have been feeling like I’d lost my ability to read lengthy novels. Now, I’ve realized I haven’t lost that ability. I just needed material I wanted to keep reading. And thus, another edition of the A Song of Ice and Fire saga, finished! A Feast for Crows narrowed the scope of the series to only a portion of the characters found in previous books. Notably absent were some of the characters I love most (Tyrion, where for art thou?!). This has been lamented ad nauseum in a majority of reviews I read for this book. I refrained from reading reviews, mostly to avoid spoilers, until after finishing this. Wow. The anger! The sheer distress and hatred! I had to pause before writing this to think “Did I miss something? Was this book really so bad?” And to myself I answer . . . Nope. In an attempt to relate to my fellow reviewers I should say, I can see the anger when you’ve had to wait ages for this book, or had to wait ages for the next one. I have been spoiled when reading this series because so many of the books were available at the time I started. For a portion of reading AFFC I had moments of wanting to skip through certain point of views (Samwell, why can’t I like you? Stop the simpering and man up already!!). My reading experience fell in line with previous installments of this series where I found that the last quarter or so of the book really picked up. I had no issues plowing through to the end and then immediately purchased A Dance with Dragons. I didn’t want to leave the world for very long. Sorry 634 other books I’ve picked up and haven’t finished yet! Part of the real gravity of this book didn’t hit me until I was reflecting on it now to write this. A lot of the story felt like characters were just shuffling around for most of the book. Upon further reflection it wasn’t just shuffling. Martin set up so much conflict to explode (hopefully) for the next book. Some people are going to get theirs (they better or I will HUNT YOU DOWN MARTIN - I think I’m required to say something like that, in all caps, in this review . . .). There were some events near the end that had me wanting to run to friends who have read the books and say “OH EM GEE!!” I can only give AFFC 3 stars though. I liked the book. But I didn't love it. There were enough times I found myself rolling my eyes at yet another repeat of phrasing or descriptions that I just cannot give this book a higher rating. I typically don’t read fantasy. I have had a hard time making it through long novels lately. But Martin has kept me connected and interested for four books now, and onto the fifth.","2014-02-03","United States","","true","53","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2X7HAG9L4KOH9"
"B000FCKGPC","5","Read the first three and thinking about stopping? I honestly suggest you reconsider","Between four and five stars. Unlike a lot of fans of this series, I didn't start reading it until a couple of months ago. I normally read very little fiction at all and have owned a paperback copy of the first book for a few years now and just never got past the first few chapters (and I had never watched the TV series either). I needed a book for a long international trip and decided to download the Kindle version of book 1 for the hell of it and...well...I was consumed. I tore through the first three books on my Kindle app with gusto. I don't think I have torn through a fictional series with such enthusiasm since I was in college (I'm in my 40s now). When I finished the third book I went to download the fourth and noticed, with no small amount of dismay, that the reviews seemed to be rather ho-hum. And considering the long publication gap between books 3 and 4 and again between 4 and 5, it seemed plausible that Martin had perhaps ""lost the magic"". I decided to just stop and get caught up on the show instead rather than be disappointed. But I missed reading them, so not a week went by before I reversed course and downloaded book 4, tearing through it in about a week. For the most part, I can honestly say that I do not understand the criticisms. This novel is pretty much just as strong as the first three. His method of breaking up books 4/5 into sets of characters may have been infuriating for those that read book 4 upon publication and then had to wait years to get book 5 but, if you are like me and only recently made time to read the series, you will not have that problem. Instead, you and I will join the queue of sad-hats waiting for book 6 to come out.","2015-07-22","United States","","true","54","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NH6UJA4LX0GN"
"B000FCKGPC","4","It's what I expected...","I think that I'm different from the majority of Martin readers in that I came to ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" late, and as a result, I've read the whole series straight through without enduring the long wait for ""A Feast for Crows"" that earlier fans had to endure. As a result, I'm not as disappointed with the pace of the story that others are. Frankly, the pace of the story reminds me of ""A Game of Thrones""... remember, that book had a slow start as well. I really see this book (and the next) as the start of a new trilogy - and remember, you'll get your favorite characters (Tyrion, Jon, Daenerys, etc.) back with the next installment as well. However, I am a bit concerned that the series has lost the focus of the first three books. Most of the plot mysteries that kept you reading the first three books have been tied up, and ""A Feast for Crows"" doesn't really provide any new ones - here's to hoping that ""A Dance with Dragons"" up's the ante in this regard. One does feel that some of the chapters in this book are pure ""filler""...Briene's especially. Bottom line, ""A Dance with Dragons"" really needs to deliver to keep me interested in this series, I felt the first pangs of ""Westeros fatigue"" setting in while reading this book. I also sincerely hope that Martin has a clear endgame planned for this series. He frequently states that ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" will be told in seven books, I really hope he sticks to that promise...he needs the discipline. However, the large sums of money to be made with this franchise virtually insure that the story of Westeros will continue into the future...my bet is on a set of prequel books about the Targaryn dynasty (you heard it here first!).","2006-02-03","United States","","true","55","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2O9SFBDJGMO9Z"
"B000FCKGPC","5","Continuing the journey","There are a lot of negative reviews here saying to skip this entry in the Song Of Ice And Fire, that chapters go nowhere. That's is untrue. Well, mostly. You shouldn't skip this entry. Because some truly shocking events happen to some big characters - Arya, Cersei, Brienne, Jamie.. and new characters, POV and secondary are given more of a spotlight that I'm sure will feed into the larger narrative in the next 3 books of SOIAF - The Martells, the Greyjoys... (I haven't started Dance With Dragons yet - starting tonight) True, there are a few chapters that don't have the gut-punch on the last page, or the cliff-hanger revelation. Some chapters are just set-up. But even those are beautifully written. Are there too many characters in this universe that we can't possibly keep up with them all? Of course. Does that take away from the larger story here? No. If you're invested in how these characters survive, or not, read and enjoy. And no, Jon, Tyrion and Daenerys are not featured here. You should know by now that Feast For Crows and Dance With Dragons were initially one volume intended as the followup to Storm of Swords. But it was too expansive - even for George RR! - to include in one volume. So he split up the POV characters. Jon, Tyrion and Dany and more all get their stories in DWD. He explains this himself at the end of FFC. No really, it's the Epilogue. He knew you guys would be all ""Where was Tyrion? Where was Jon? Where were our dragons?!!"" Relax. Patience. You're being a real Robert Arryn right now. The real patience will be tested after I've read DWD and have to wait for Winds of Winter and Dream of Spring - to be released in... ?

"B000FCKGPC","5","The most underrated and misunderstood book in the series","I don't share other people's opinion that the ""Feast for Crows"" is a failure. I think that this is the best book so far, though I haven't read the fifth book yet. Why am I saying this? I think Martin's writing is much more mature in this book than in the previous ones. It is true that the plot is not advancing at a fast pace, but in my opinion this not a bad thing. For me, the much deeper characterization makes up for the lack of action. We get a much more intimate view into the minds of the different point of view characters. (The following explanations may contain spoilers for some, beware.) I loved the way we could glimpse into the minds of Cersei and Jaime. Their chapters are simply brilliantly written. Just a little example to show Martin's new way of letting us go deeper into the characters: Whenever Jamie looks at Cersei flirting or just being nice with other men he always remembers Tyrion's remark ""...she's been ****ing Lancel and Osmund Kettleback and Moonboy for all I know..."" This little sentence appears at least a hundred times in Jamie's chapters, and it does not become boring, on the contrary. It shows how tormented and jealous Jamie is. Repetition is a powerful way to emphasize emotions; Martin uses it to a great effect. The previous example was only one out of many. I enjoyed Cersei's chapters, too. It is a bold an welcome change that a really ""evil"" character was chosen as an important point of view character for this book. It is good that we get to know what motivates this almost insane woman, and how power and unjustified self-confidence can lead to a borderline personality. I can understand that after the furious and action-packed ""Storm of Swords"" some readers felt that this book is a disappointment. Not for me. But those who need battles and sword-fights and characters dying each chapter may feel cheated. Please, look more closely. This book is a gem. You can rarely read a better description of what psychological effects war and power have on people's minds. All in all, definitely a five-star book, but I must admit this is not everybody's piece of cake.","2011-07-26","United States","","true","57","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2145DLGCT5VSN"

If you've read the first three books in the series, don't stop now. You will definitely enjoy this book. However, I do have to say that this was probably my least favorite in the series to date (at the time of this review, A Dance With Dragons is the most recent book to have been published). That doesn't mean this was a bad book though; it's simply being compared to four other books that I like a lot. The issue at this point in the series is that the world Martin has created is VERY big. He knows his characters so well, and he writes from so many characters' perspectives that there simply isn't enough room for them all in this book. So he's focused on a few of the characters here. And although he does a great job with the characters that he uses, this book simply doesn't include some of my favorites - not because they aren't around, or because they aren't a part of the story anymore - just because the book would be too big if he did include them. He returns to their perspectives in the next book, backtracking in his timeline so that A Feast For Crows and A Dance With Dragons are actually covering the same timeframe for the most part. This way you get to see what the other characters were up to. This method doesn't take away from the merits of this book though. It was still very good, and I was intrigued the whole way through.

(The book itself is wonderful, and I understand why GRRM divided the material between this novel and the next book, even though it is a little frustrating not to hear about certain beloved characters. The book probably could have been edited down a bit, but I'm happy to have all the bits he included.) I first read all five books (nothing beyond is published at this time, alas) as either hard-copy, paper-and-ink versions or as ebooks, so I already loved Westeros when I acquired the audiobook versions. I listened to the audiobooks of 1-4 during my work commute; it took all of 2014, as my commute is not very long. Books 1-3 were narrated by Roy Dotrice, and I loved his narration for the most part (even though, yes, his women all sound like elderly crones). So it was initialy hard to like the John Lee narration. It didn't help that the first chapter you hear is about some incredibly minor, uninteresting character. It was a slow-paced chapter, and John Lee's initial narration sounds extremely slow, so for the first half-hour, maybe even the first hour of narration, I was horribly disappointed. However, the pace picks up directly, and John Lee's narrative gifts become more and more evident. By halfway through the book, I found myself wishing he could continue as the reader for the next volume. By the end, I loved his interpretations even more than Roy Dotrice's. Now I have to go back to RD for A Dance with Dragons, and it is an older RD, too, so I am a little apprehensive about it...

"B000FCKGPC","3","A Sea of Words, Signifying Little","The most inventive, intriguing, literate, and engrossing adult fantasy to be written in thirty years, has, unfortunately, hit a rather large road bump with this, the fourth volume. As I don't follow Martin's web site I was not aware that this volume only presents half of the main characters of the first three, leaving out some of the most interesting and loved ones, their portion of this time period relegated to the fifth volume, whenever it will be published. This alone is not that much of a problem; Martin's tapestry is so large that there is plenty of story to be told even within the remaining subset. The real trouble is, he doesn't tell that story for the first five hundred pages! Instead, we are treated to seemingly endless descriptions of heraldry; new viewpoint characters whose stories are definitely peripheral to the original story arc - and this is in a story that already has so many characters that it takes sixty pages of appendix just to list them, definitely posing problems for the poor reader trying to keep track of them all; and way too much scheming and talking rather than action. Very possibly a good half of this work could have been cut without losing any of the important story details, and the net result would have been a much stronger work, better paced, where anticipation of impending action could have been sustained until things actually start to happen, which is about the last one hundred pages of this. That last hundred pages do a fair amount to redeem this volume, where things finally coalesce into definite story lines, and the complex interweave of characters, each with their own desires and schemes to get what they want, which was the overriding trait of the first three volumes, becomes evident again. Jamie at least starts to become an interesting person; Cersie, the person everyone loves to hate, looks like she may have boxed herself into a corner; Sansa, it appears, will be forced out of her safe cocoon and back into being a player in the game of thrones; Arya has, perhaps, the most interesting change in life style and circumstances. If the fifth volume can maintain the pace and interesting events of the last one hundred pages of this work, the full story will be back on track as one of the best fantasies, ever. However, if it too gets bogged down in too much unnecessary detail and non-happenings, I think it will spell the end to this series, and volume six won't be purchased by me at least. Edited 06/12/2011: I just concluded re-reading all four volumes back-to-back. Doing so keeps everything (and everybody) fresh in your mind, and it helped considerably with this volume. Much more of the details seem to have relevance; and at the same time, having seen the long lists of lords and heraldic devices in the prior volumes, made it easier to just skim this material here. I still believe that much of verbiage of this book could have been safely eliminated, and I hope he has made this type of adjustment in the final book, which is finally going to be published on July 12 - a much longer wait than I ever thought would happen. But given my current re-read experience, I'd up my rating a half-star for this volume. --- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)","2006-05-12","United States","","true","61","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KUW4JO9RJH38"

Yes, if the next installment justifies the enormous amount of pages used in this story to tell all the side stories that are going on in order (one hopes) to develop the characters in this story. Could this story have been more concise? It's hard to imagine that it couldn't have been, but this is a very different kind of Fantasy, that has a level of depth of motivation and viewpoint unheard of in any story of its kind. All of the many ""main"" characters are multi-dimensional, with many shades of grey. Is this story too ambitious? Maybe, (there is like a 100 page appendix of names of characters to keep track of) but I hope not, only time and the rest of the story will tell. Like the rest of the installments in this saga, this is not a book for kids, and not a book for the prudish. Two more warnings, I hadn't read the previous installments in over a year, and didn't want to read them over again to refresh my memory, it made for slow reading trying to remember how characters had gotten to where they were in the story, and lastly, most of the more interesting story lines are not in this book, the author explains in the afterward, that he wanted to tell this part first, so... you might want to wait and read it all in a row, but I didn't want to, and I'm glad I didn't.","2006-03-03","United States","","true","62","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R259UF04NEOCLM"
"B000FCKGPC","5","How can this be a one-star when it is better than 99% of the fantasy currently written?","I am amazed at so many people rating the book as a one-star! That's the lowest possible! Surely it is just pique because it wasn't what they expected. And what is the hurry to get this series finished? I'd be glad if Martin wrote one book set in this world that I could read each year until my demise (or his). Unlike Robert Jordan, whose books are premised on a grand finale battle, or quest books when the quest is fulfilled, what is the natural end of this series? So far, many of the characters have seen their plans end in their own ruin. Isn't this a lot like our world? Are the negative reviewers out there envisioning some ""and they lived happily ever after"" ending for their favorite characters? Maybe Tirion will marry Dany or something like that! I very much enjoy more elaboration on the Ironmen, Dorne and Braavos. Who cares if they don't lead to ""progress,"" in the sense of a traditional plot-line? In this book, Martin shows even more sophistication in his knowledge of medieval culture; for one example only, look at how he handles the heraldry. Those who don't know what ""vairy"" or a ""bend"" is are going to have to look it up in order to picture what he is talking about. I like that, although maybe most don't. He has some memorable lines, such as a scholar who likes dead history more than living history because ""dead history is written in ink, live history is written in blood."" So true. I'm not one who gives everything Martin wrote ""5-stars"". As a matter of fact, I'm not wild about most of what GRRM wrote until he started this series. This is his masterpiece, though. I'd say to him, ""make it as long as you want. Don't worry about 'finishing' it."" If I could make one criticism: more maps! It is annoying to be reading about geographical locations that aren't found on the included maps!","2005-12-20","United States","","true","63","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15TRD2EBCO2HD"
"B000FCKGPC","4","Left unsaid","At first I was like “where is everyone else?” Then I got to the last page and read the authors note about how he broke it up into 2 books since there was so much to cover. If you haven’t seen it read this, stop reading. Ok, so This wasn’t my favorite book in the series so far. The chapters I was interested in reading were about Cersi, Jaime and Brienne (in that order) and I didn’t get excited about Briennes part until the last chapter of her. Now I’m like WTF happened to her?! Anyway, back to Cersi, reading about her made me understand why she is like this. She wants to be treated as an equal so she does ruthless things that she believes men would do in her place. Still a bitch though. Jaime, he certainly changes after having his hand cut off and traveling with Brienne in the last book. I kind of felt bad for him, but I think he needed that to happen in order for him to change. Otherwise he’d still be a dick. I like that there was an underlining show of respect (or affection if you really wanted it that way) with Jaime and Brienne. A part of me wants them together lol The book also talked about Arya and Sansa. It was more about their journey of what they go through to end up where they should be in the next book or so. Exciting, nope, but I guess necessary. I see why a lot of people didn’t like this.","2018-07-03","United States","","true","64","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23YAYUSFHDSXV"
"B000FCKGPC","1","Should I just poke my eyes out now to put myself out of my misery?","I got interested in this series of books by Martin by watching the HBO series. After each episode I felt this deep sense of dissatisfaction. The characters were flat, the plot line jumped around without giving you any ""meat"" .... poor character development. So I decided that the books ""just have to be better"" since many times that's the case when you move words onto the screen. Well, I was WRONG. The first three books were okay, then I got to this book. I don't know how to express it properly, accept I found myself skipping chapters and wondering when ANYTHING was going to get resolved. I've read the reviews of the 5th book and have decided to ditch the HBO series and the books, I have better things to read and watching ""Hoarders, Buried Alive"" is actually more interesting. Don't waste your time and money on this series. It is absolutely nothing like anything Tolkein ever wrote or other great authors like Marion Zimmer Bradley - and probably many, many others. There is so much potential in the original idea for this series of books that I have to just make some suggestions. First, the characters like Arya, Sansa, Daenarys and the other younger characters should not be children. It would work so much better if they were in their late teens/early twenties. The dragons would not take an eternity to grow. In fact by the third book they would be nearly full grown. Why not, they're dragons after all. With those changes I would leave the plot line much like it is to the point that Tyrion escapes. He would escape in a fast ship in the harbor and head for the free lands. There he would have some interesting encounters and eventually would wind up in Daenary's court. There after proving himself to be trustworthy and the good guy he really is, would become her counselor and friend. Arya would go to Braavos, actually talk with Sam Wise and learn what was going on with her family and the threat in the northlands. She would be trained as a warrior/assassin and sent by the Brotherhood of the Many Faced God to Daenary's court and become her friend and confidant. Cersei would continue to be a plotting scheming ""queen"" contract a ""love disease"" and die a painful death, but just before her last breath she would tell Jaime that she always loved him and was sorry for being such a witch to him. Jaime would become the regent and tell Temmon that he was his father - lots of tears and hugs. Brianne would become Captain of the Kings Guard (first woman, would stir up some controversy) and things in Kingslanding would have some interesting side stories. As the dragons grew Daenary, Arya and Tyrion would become dragon riders. Mean while in the north.... Rob Stark would not have been murdered and would not marry. He would unite with Stannis to fight the ""evil in the frozen lands"" and set up a kingdom at Winterfell. Jon Snow would still command the Wall and make peace and alliance with the Wildlings (and probably marry someone really wonderful). Skipping right along. The ""evil in the north"" would begin to move south and attack the wall. Arya would fly north on her dragon and find Bran (who by now would be something like a wizard/Merlin type character) and unearth the old magical weapons left by the First Men that will kill the ""evil in the north"" with the help of the dragons and dragon riders. The big war begins, dragons with riders armed with the magic weapons engage in the attack (great descriptions of battles, , aided by Rob, Stannis and Jon. At the last minute Jaime and the knights from the south join in the fight. Big huge gut wrenching battle, Arya finally kills the really bad head evil in the north, some live, some die (probably Jaime dies to regain his honor at last and end the curse of being the ""King Slayer""... maybe sacrifices himself to save Tyrion). Rob falls in love with Daenarys, they marry, Tyrion becomes a great counselor, Arya finally meets someone to love her (could be a girl, who knows) and the kingdom is ruled by their descendants for 10,000 years in peace and justice.

"B000FCKGPC","5","Best books I've ever read ! Someone compared this to Lord of the Rings and I could definitely agree with the comparison!","If you only saw the TV series (2011) based on book 1 , or if you just happen to pick up book 1 GAME OF THRONES, you might be a bit sceptic the first 2-3 chapters, but trust me, as with a lot of movies & filmed series the book is always much better and becomes addictive once the first 3 chapters are done. You get immersed in a world of Dire Wolves, Kings & Queens, diplomatic plots (trust me it's not boring politics). You get a glimpse of a world beyond a wall which only really comes to life in book 3 & 4. In A Feast For Crows, book 4 in the series of 7, again the plots change, Kings and Queens reigns are shifted, honour codes are broken, far away lands where mysterious creatures live: giant mammoths, wildlings and ""Others"" get featured chapters, whilst the main characters find themselves in much different situations then before, a very realistic and still fantasy driven story. The beauty of these books is that every chapter is written from another person's perspective, now in book 4 you find out what might have happened in book 1 to 3 with other characters in other lands. You find out to your surprise that some characters far away from each other are crossing territory and actually meeting without knowing that they are involved in the overall story of other characters, they are linked in blood, honour and destiny. That's why I love these books, you get actively involved with all volumes at the same time. Every chapter leaves an open end and starts with a different character right after, so you need to read on to find out what the outcome is of your previous chapter...That's what makes reading Game of Thrones very addictive, in a bit of literature English giving you that look and feel of another era, wanting you to devour chapter after chapter after chapter to find out what happened with the personalities you love.

If you've been following my reviews of this series, you'll notice I've been compelled to give the series thus far 5 out of 5, yet now I'm giving this one a 3 star? What gives? The problem is that the novelty has worn off, and I'm finding GRRM's gluttony for sadness and despair is breaking my ability to relate to and immerse in his story. It really comes down to just one single point: I have no one left to cheer for: In this story, it is becoming laughingly predictable that the better of a person you are, the more likely you are to die a horrendous death or be otherwise maimed and destroyed. When deaths happened in book 1, I felt them. I was shocked. I was surprised. Now? I find I don't really care about any of the characters. Hell, half of them I want to die just because I hate reading from their perspective (cough, Sam, cough). I really reading this book now to find out how it ends. I'm not ROOTING for anyone! How f'n sad is that? GRRM's obsession with murdering characters has trained me to not empathize with anyone. You'd think I'd at least root for someone, right? Nah. Just end the series, bro. Like I said, I'm a big character guy. I read stories for the characters (like most people), so when a story is so hellbent on slaying anyone worthy of cheering, or otherwise converting them to a horror or a bore, I lose a lot of steam. The storytelling is still great, the world is deep, and the history is interesting, except now it's not. With each new land and house, a dump truck of information I don't care about is unloaded upon me. Like Dorne. Don't care about them either. I'm really just reading for Stannis at this point. There are a few others that hold some mild interest to me, but I'm not cheering for them. I expect them to die rather quickly, and if they don't, I probably won't be elated either, unfortunately. I'll finish ADWD, but I may very well end my adventure into this series there, depending on how it goes.","2020-08-04","United States","","true","67","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RX34N9FF0IK5B"
"B000FCKGPC","2","Bad decisions result in an underwhelming book","This book is one I dove into eagerly after what I consider the best book in the five part series. To my terror book 4 and 5 make it clear that George's creation has somehow spiraled out of control. The Prologue is the worst out of any of the 5 books, as befits the worst book in the series. It is a fine example of the starting-but-not-finishing trends book 4 and 5 thrive off of. The only reference to the prologue again is in one of the equally bad Samwell chapters. This is the first book in the series where you could easily just read a flash card with a sentence on it in place of a chapter and be thankful for it. Samwell's entire arc could be skipped, or shortened. Jon already has a chapter in ADWD that details the first part, and the second part could be fulfilled in a single Sam chapter in ADWD or whenever he becomes relevant in the next books. Brienne could be summarized as wandering around the country before clearly surviving a terrible cliffhanger(which by the way, wont be answered in the next book). The Dornish and Ironmen stuff is alright. I wasn't even offended by it because it was better than Brienne, Sam, or the excess of Cersei chapters(which I don't mind, but in moderation). Arya has graduated to being a worthless character from one of the best, and will happily remain like that well into the next installment. Its clear George knew what he wanted to do with her but had no idea how to get there after book one, but this is the first time it is downright painful. Sansa is alright, but suffers largely from George's now redundant formula of tons of description followed by an interesting last page or paragraph. Where she is now just isn't super interesting, the chapter about her descent with the boy lord is probably the first time I straight up skimmed a chapter in this series of thousands of pages. Basically all it amounts to is ""littlefinger is clever"" ""Sansas is growing"" ""and holy crap after the last chapter in SOS I expected better"". Jaime, one of my favorites is pretty stagnant here, but arguably goes through the most believable growth. George still writes great, but it is so clunky and bogged up that it makes the crappy POV's unbearable and the good ones tedious. To demonstrate, in AGOT Cats journey to Kings landing was not several chapters. It happened hastily because there was an end goal to be reached, and the journey was not a significant element. However in a feast for crows almost EVERYONE is stuck in the stasis of a journey(or standing around). Imagine if AGOT spent 3 chapters for the trips of Cat to and from Kings Landing, and that when the Khalasar ventured to their conquests the journey was documented. That on the way south from Winterfell the trip before and after the Joffery incident were written in detail. You get the idea. These meaningless journeys prefaced by cliffhanger endings aren't needed in the first books because there IS a destination. Martin knew where we were going and was excited to get there. That is the core problem with the plot and pacing of the series. As far as the main flaw in the writing formula, the whole description, description, description, CLIFFHANGER routine is seriously getting old in conjunction with the previously mentioned problem. There are cliffhangers just for the sake of being cliffhangers, so much to the point that nothing happens in the meat of the chapters. I kid you not, only about two chapters have anything truly interesting happen before the last paragraph. The final problem and the most infuriating is that every book(although the first 3 could justify it and had some big event or resolution) builds up, and leaves a plethora of cliffhangers. In 1 and 2 especially it was done well enough that you could imagine just enough and smile at what you thought might happen, but in 4 and 5 it all just feels random. The worst part about this book is that the next one suffers the same problems and NONE of the cliffhangers from this book are resolved, instead countless more spring up.","2011-12-25","United States","","true","68","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3I4HZAGFVQW3J"
"B000FCKGPC","5","A Feast for Crows","After reading the reviews here for ""A Feast for Crows"" I almost didn't read it. Glad I ignored the reviews. I read ""A Game of Thrones"" in 1999 and was hooked immediately. It was out in paperback and ""A Clash of Kings"" was out in hardback. Devoured it, but had to wait a bit for ""A Storm of Swords."" Unfortunately ""A Feast for Crows"" didn't come out till 2005 (while I was checking GRRM's web site almost daily). Started to read it but I had forgotten all of the characters and plot lines, and I didn't finish it. Then last year ""A Dance with Dragons"" was published and the HBO series came out and I decided to start over. The second time around the initial trilogy was even better climaxing in a major character (and sometimes two) being killed off in almost every chapter. Heart pounding excitement. Now that I'm well into ""A Feast for Crows"" I view it as an interlude. Sure there's not nearly the excitement, but GRRM's imagination runs rampant. His use of language (""...but what Wat was really wanting was a woman.), creation of new worlds, and allusion to other works (Arya as Sweet Molly Mallone selling mussels and cockles) is nothing short of amazing. Who else would come up with Canker Jeyne (who is really a man) as a name for a prostitute. Cersei finally gets to run the whole show (or thinks she does) in Westeros. Jaime develops a soul. Sure, I miss Danarys, and most of all Tyrion, but they'll be back. Meanwhile we get to follow Arya as she crosses paths with Samwell in Braavos, and follow Brienne as she finally learns the fate of the Dog from the Elder Brother on the Quiet Isle during her travels with the wonderful Septon Meribald and his Dog. And what about the story lines developing in Dorne and the Iron Islands. Another great book from GRRM.

"B000FCKGPC","1","You can't be serious...","I was a soldier in Iraq when this book was released. I had been eagerly waiting for 4 years for a new installment of what I felt at the time was the best and brightest light in the fantasy sub-genre. I was disappointed. By now you know that every major character that GRRM had cultivated for nearly 3000 pages, 10 years and 3 novels was absent or only mentioned peripherally at best. But that's not the biggest betrayal of this novel. The biggest betrayal is the introduction of new POVs that we, as readers, have nothing invested in. We couldn't care less about them and aren't given any compelling reasons to begin caring. Brienne, Samwell, the Greyjoys, and anything happening in Dorne were minor ornamentations to the first three novels -- and that's being generous in some cases. In this one, they are center-stage for a solid 2/3rds of the text and they contribute nothing. NOTHING. They don't advance the plot, they don't illuminate motivations of the major players, they don't even bother to capture your interest. Brienne LITERALLY rides around and looks for someone the whole book. That's it. I just summed up in eleven words what evidently takes a dozen or so entire chapters for GRRM to convey. For a fan of the world of ASOIAF, this is an ""okay"" novel. It provides depth of background and expands the tapestry of this world, letting you into the minds of characters that, prior to this novel, you had no access to. For fans of the STORY of ASOIAF, this book is a virtual waste of time. There are perhaps half a dozen chapters that advance the story and, after all, I believe thats what most of us are craving. As I type this, we've been waiting almost 5 years for the next installment, A Dance with Dragons. I won't bore you with reasons why I'm irritated about it. (At this point, you're either a GRRM apologist and have forgiven him for making you wait almost a decade for something new to happen in his creation, or you're not. I am not.) However, to say that I've moved on to other stories and writers is an understatement. If you're new to ASOIAF, I'm advising you to avoid these novels. I have a feeling GRRM will end up breaking our hearts. He is notorious for not keeping notes and ""writing from his mind"". So unlike Jordan, who had extensive outlines, notes and ideas for a future ghostwriter to work from in the event of his untimely death, GRRM may leave nothing but an unfinished series. At the very least, you can probably skip this novel. What ""A New Spring"" was to the Wheel of Time series, this book will be to ASOIAF. An interesting side-journey for hardcore fans, but, to the casual reader, ultimately a marketing diversion intended to soak you of more money.","2010-10-04","United States","","true","70","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UXXURJF5V3LT"
"B000FCKGPC","5","His writing is good enough to get away with ""mistakes""","Is this better than Storm of Swords, no, but I wasn't expecting that. Are there too many characters to keep track of, yes. Has the story seemed to spun out of control, going off on a million tangents, yes (btw, what is the story, so many of the main guys are dead). Do I rememeber everything from the previous books so this makes perfect sense, no. But each chapter is so well written, almost like a short story onto itself. I'm upset at the end of each chapter that it's over, starting a new one seems like a chore, and then I'm engrossed a page into the next one. Martin is NOT for everyone. If you want good Vs. evil then stay away. Instead we have depth, and see the POV of some pretty sick people. The fact of the matter is that Jamie, Cersei, Victarion, Littlefinger and so on are all monsters. Truly noble character are few, and even they become pretty brutal as the story goes on. Is Arya really such a good person as would all like her to be? Sometimes the brutality, all the raping, plotting and so on does seem a little over the top. Except for Catylin (yes mispelled) in the last book, no one else makes any attempt to stop the fighting, plotting, murder and so on. It's just so interesting, even if I know he's going off on a tangent, I don't care cause it's so fun to read. Some people have compared this to RJ, and some of the later wheel of time books middle of book 7 - 10, where truly a bore. With both the story as spun out of control with more characters, but all of Martins characters are oringinal, we are aware of the plots and don't have to try figuring them out from 1 or 2 sentanced over several books, we have original characters, and things DO happen. It not like wheel of time where, for example, Perrin goes on a 2 page book to recover his wife, doing nothing the entire time!

"B000FCKGPC","5","A real Sleeper in the ASOIaF series","People seem to dislike this book most of the series. I think this is primarily because of the 'split' nature of books 4 and 5 (both books cover the same time period, but covers different regions of the world / different POVs). This is mildly problematic, as it really is a symptom of GRRM losing focus on the main plotlines and really beginning all kinds of plot lines. That being said, I still found both books to be very enjoyable. Feast for Crows starts out riding a high from Storm of Swords. Storm had so much happening, so many drastic changes in powers, characters, and even the world at whole. Also, Storm of course featured several large events that drastically shook up the situation in many storylines. So, what does Feast accomplish? Feast is really about stability. There really isn't any massive, crazy exciting events that occur, but we can see the foundations of the end game really get laid. Many characters rise to new prominence, and we see existing front line characters really solidify there place in the world. Many of the storylines heavily foreshadow some insane events in the future, and that just makes my excitement for the last two books in the series (assuming we get them!) even greater. In general, while this is really a ""tie over"" book that cleans up the aftermath of Storm nicely, it is still very enjoyable book. Plenty of action, plenty of character development, and enough interesting storylines to keep the whole plot moving.","2020-09-01","United States","","true","72","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVNLFXRGZ55LO"

I have read and re-read these books. the world and the characters are so details and complex. The plot is interwoven between the many characters, and it very lengthy and intricate, and this series is not for those who require immediate gratification to say the least. The complexity and multiple story lines makes for a very long narrative, so be warned. In my opinion, I love lengthy, complex stories with many characters and story lines. I actually seek them out, and I love every aspect of these books every time I've read them. For me, the characters are very real individuals. I found myself disliking some of the characters as bad/evil in the beginning, but their circumstances and histories changed my mind later. I found Martin wrote children and woman convincingly, and a female reader I am often disappointed by stereotypical, two dimensional female characters and whiny, stupid children. I also found the castle life depicted to be gritty and realistic instead of flower and graceful as it is often depicted in fantasy books. And, this book is not flowery or kind in anyway. The characters are tormented and mistreated by each other and themselves. The world is fascinating and unlike anything I've seen. The seasons take years. When winter comes, its long and brutal. The frozen north is inhabited by an evil lost to legend, and the winter is coming, and defenses at the border are diminished, and no one believes there is a threat. The northern kingdom set to watch the border is lost, and the other kingdoms are all vying for power. I have been awaiting the last of this series for a few years now, and while I am frustrated, I do not, absolutely do not, feel that frustration at having to wait is worth dragging down this incredible series with one star reviews.

Somehow the political & personal strategies and manipulations are intriguing and I find myself trying to out guess the author of what a character might do next. The description of characters and the actors (in the books & on TV) all do an outstanding job of making me like them or hate them, in some cases even care about them. The first 3 books (seasons) were so crammed with action that this one did seem a little slow as others have said and the reader is left wondering what has happened to at least two major characters. I think of it as a transition period for the story. Tough to beat all the major things that happened in book 3. However, I found the ending of Book 4 just and I admit it made me smile thinking about how the author might have felt while he was writing it. And, now I'm wondering what alliances might be formed in Book 5. I like that the books are done as chapters on each character and tied together. I like to watch the season & then read the book that corresponds. So far (with only a couple of exceptions that I've noticed), the books seem like screen plays for the seasons, very much aligned. I'm ready to start Book 5, but I don't want to get further ahead of the TV version. I'm eagerly waiting for the next season to start.

"B000FCKGPC","3","GRRM expanded and slowed down too much in books 4 and 5","Simply put, books 4 and 5 were letdowns compared to the first three. I enjoy GRRM's writing style and I love the world he has built, however it is my opinion that the layout of these two books were a bad decision that has negatively affected the overall plan and momentum of the series. Both books basically cover the same timespan with the characters split between them. A bad decision as far as story management goes. I would recommend using one of the guides you can find online to read the two books together. My next problem is the amount of new characters and storylines that were added. Many of them (if not most) were just not entertaining and I’m worried will prove to be unnecessary. Yet our favorite characters’ stories were watered down and started moving at a snail’s pace (Dany, Jon, Tyrion), or were simply rarely visited (Bran) in what I assume to be a case of stalling. Stalling for what? - I don’t know but I’m hoping (HOPING!!!) Winds will answer all of that for us. Ultimately, my opinion is that these two books are where the story simply got away from GRRM. He admitted he struggled with them and originally wanted to fast forward a few years. Well, instead of fast forwarding, he expanded and slowed it down; and once Feast was published, he had no choice but to do that same thing with Dance. I'm worried that IF the series is ever finished, we're going to look back at these two books and realize there was no reason for them to be as long and drawn out as they were. It would not surprise me if he's having a hard time reigning everything back in with Winds. He expanded so much in Feast and Dance but he’s got to start reigning things in with Winds or completing the series will be a hopeless cause. Recommendation: Re-read books 4 and 5 together, at the same time. Or even read them together the first time.

Though written independently, it wouldn't make much sense to just pick up A Feast for Crows and read it, without having read A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords. That being said, I'm having a difficult time with this one. GRRM admits that this book was a bitch to write; for me, it's a bitch to read. In the first three parts, I couldn't wait to get to the next page. I'm not feeling that with this one. Maybe the story has just taken too long to unfold; I don't know. But, while reading it, I find myself drifting off and wondering to myself, ""What should I have for dinner tonight."" Put another way, I just don't care about the characters. Even when I get to an Arya chapter, I'm less excited than I used to be. When I finished A Storm of Swords, I was eager to start on AFFC, but he didn't really pick up where he'd left off, at least not with all the characters. I won't write in any spoilers here, but some characters are teased on in the final bit of ASOS, and then ignored almost entirely in this one. GRRM makes a big deal of mentioning his motives for writing stories that aren't predictable, and then sets about as if to break the world's record for unpredictability. It just seems to me that trying so hard to be unpredictable for the sake of originality is not a worthy goal. We all love being surprised, but enough already. I have enjoyed this series and will continue to read it, because I want the entire story. It seems that two more books are due (after ADWD) and so I'll hang in there and hope A Dance with Dragons is a more entertaining read. My hope is that the popularity and style of the television show will not spoil his books to come, or influence his writing in a way that cheapens it.","2013-11-11","United States","","true","77","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RL3J57CB86MF9"
"B000FCKGPC","4","A Fun Read","The negative reviews here are totally off the mark. First, there's not a huge difference in quality between this book and the earlier books. It's the same author, writing about the same characters, in the same settings. People seem to be putting the first three books on a pedestal and throwing this one on the dung heap, and it doesn't make sense to me. Take this book for what it is, and this series for what it is: entertainment. Don't expect to find the answer to the meaning of the life, the universe, and everything. The stylistic differences between book three and book four are little and less and these negative reviews here on Amazon are a mummer's farce. Okay, look, if you hate those types of phrases then don't read the series at all. These phrases are used often, and they can be grating, but they're fully present and accounted for in the earlier books. These phrases and the other archaisms increase the dark-ages atmosphere. Is the action less in book 4 than in books 2 or 3? Book 4 is more filled with quests than battles, but they're interesting quests that result in significant character development. Far from agreeing that ""nothing happens,"" in my opinion momentous developments occur. Look, where's Cersei at the end of this one? Where's Jamie? Where's Caitlyn, Sansa, Arya, etc.? Big stuff is going on here. If you enjoy this series, don't miss this book. Unrealistic expectations for Nirvana won't be met, but it's a good book that's both engrossing and entertaining. Thumb's up. Incidentally, the answer is 42.","2012-08-24","United States","","true","78","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZKB9O7CST40I"
"B000FCKGPC","2","A Serious Absence of Conflict","To start off, I want to say that going into this novel I could not be more excited. Coming off of the previous novel, which was such a fantastic rush, I just felt let down in general by this book. It plodded along at its own painful boring pace, and got to the point where reading it was a chore. It even got to the point where I was reading just to be able to say that I had finished the book. One of the biggest flaws in this book tends to be how absent conflict is. Within any good story there has to be some sort of conflict to keep each and every person engaged. That was just missing in A Feast for Crows. Take a few characters for example(minor spoilers): Brienne has spent her entire time wandering. She has a goal to find the Stark children, sure, but she literally has no goal or no set aim to shoot for. This makes her highly unnecessary to the plot line, and, in all but her final chapter, she bores with each chapter. This is awful because she has been one of my personal favorites in the past. Jamie is just... there. It has been one week since I finished this book and I genuinely cannot remember anything that he did specifically. I know he has started training with his good hand, but that started in the third book. When a character as pivotal and interesting as Jamie is that forgettable, you know there is a problem with the story. Sam has started a journey south, and he has started to fall in love. Oddly enough, nothing goes wrong. The end for Sam's chapters. Finally, there are the people that are to represent Dorne. Without a consistent character to follow, I am not interested at all in what is happening in Dorne. I have no reason to get invested so I typically start to skim these chapters, even if I do not want to. They are not connected to the rest of the world, therefore deeming them irrelevant. As it seems evident from these few character ""summaries"", there really is no way that this book has moved forward. This book could be argued that it is laying groundwork for future novels, but it could have at least been done in an interesting fashion. A Clash of Kings was laying the groundwork and it was still a decent novel. Completely cutting out some favorite characters of an entire book seems like an incredibly obtuse thing to do. It cuts out multiple people's interest in the series. After that heated review I would like to say a few things that this book does right. For some reason, Cersei's chapters always seems intriguing. The political side of Westeros was always interesting to me, and seeing her run around like a chicken with its head cut off was very comical. In fact, her story is the only one that I truly remember from this novel and am excited to see how it plays out. Overall, this book was a bit of a letdown. It has a few perks and exciting moments, but they are all at the end, which is to be expected. Majority of the novel is boring and useless unfortunately. Hopefully with the return of the entire ensemble in the next book it will interweave to a great climax.","2014-06-11","United States","","true","79","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34QW0R8XAPF6J"
"B000FCKGPC","5","A Fascinating Read","I was surprised to read the reviews for this book on Amazon. Some people feel that the story did not progress very much in this book, but I feel that it did. The Cersei chapters were the most interesting, because it is a character study in how power corrupts. We initially see her drive Jaime away, and then slowly she begins to isolate herself because of her paranoia. By the end she is alone and powerless, and everything begins to unravel around her. I love it when Petyr says that he expected her to disintigrate, but not this quickly! Jaime is another interesting character study. Throughout the book we see him struggle with his vows, and he tries to keep them even when it is quite difficult. He is known throughout the realm as the oathbreaker, and rather than descend even further he tries restore his honor. He slowly drifts away from Cersei until at the end he no longer loves her. After the seven kingdoms come apart at the seams in the first three books, we begin to see the effects it is having on the people. As the nobles play their game of thrones, the suffering masses begin to turn to their religions. Throughout the book we see the slow rise in power of the High Septon and the masses of ""sparrows"" who are his followers. I think you are seeing the rise of an inquisition-style cleansing of the noble sinners. Now that they are armed they have real power in the realm. There are also other forces at play such as Catelyn in the Brotherhood Without Banners, the Iron Men attacking the Tyrells, Jaqen H'guar and Samwell in Oldtown, and Arya's new training in Braavos. Will the Iron Men take Oldtown, and if so will the realm break apart further as Sam indicated? A great read and I cannot wait until the next book.","2006-10-03","United States","","true","80","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFEUS0U3DMDW3"

A great piece of work, I appreciate the backgound detail this story offers,Most stories evolve around the main characters, and thier quest or Journey, very little is mentioned of how it efffects others around them, the Good and bad of it so to speak. For me it defines the communities and this world with more details carving a greater understanding of the ways and designinging a more realistic world. I could see or think as to myself how it would effect me as a person being apart of that community. After all not all of use would make great main characters, and in some cases who would want too? Look at the choices! The Title says it all after the war what comes ? The crows Scavenging what little remains after the war. and tring to be opportunistic feeders, of what has been left ignored with it be land or a new leader. A great wordsmith and author I've become a fan of his writing. I usually go for the obivous hero and villian type novels even the dak heros have their appeal. Their are very few that aply dimension of real world application where none can be defined by a convient box or label, I guess what it deinfes for me is a novel of "" We are just Human after all"" prone to mistakes and fears, sometimes with no clue how we effect our own universe by our actions, even though we think its been well thought out.","2014-01-03","United States","","true","81","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10B11N82LCXKS"
"B000FCKGPC","2","""EPIC"" writing gone madly awry-","Others have posted a more comprehensive review that will amplify what I have to say about this series. First, you should always finish a story that you start. RR has exponentially increased the number of new story lines, without giving real closure to others (that we're more invested in at this point) Second, a good writer, while holding audience captive, should not leave his mob ""presuming"" the story line. Third. After 4, now 5 books, this story could have been told in 3. He even confesses at the end of this book in his own author notes that ""this one was a bitch""-- a confession from the author that he even feels lost to the real arc of the story. Also, the LAST ""chapter"" entitled ""meanwhile, back at the wall"" (like some batman graphic novel!) the author also identifies this gaff by not really keeping true to the story line. MINOR SPOILER: Here are characters you will NOT read about in book four: BRAN, JON, CATELYN (despite red wedding and epilogue of book 3); DAVOS, TYRION (how can this be?) and Queen DAENERYS (holy R'holler!); FURTHERMORE, you have to adjust to RENAMING of characters: ARYA's and SANSA (aka ALAYNE). As a consumer only, I feel I have the wits and authority to know ""epic"" writing and stories: goodkind, brooks, tolkien, perhaps even jordan. (I'm not bestowing their greatness on RR Martin to be sure). And this review may be an ill fated incompatibility to emerge between myself and the author's style. R.R. has strayed WAY off the kingsroad with this tome- introducing new characters to story lines that scarcely seem relevant; IGNORING others that we have a vested interest in since book one. Too much for me. He has departed the westeros for the dollar and cheats his audience -- with no direction, no clarity, no closure to be certain. I'm not referring to his character vs. chronology style here-- I'm talking about story telling that makes sense to the story. I happen to come to enjoy the character based chapters until 60% of all my characters were suddenly and inexplicably dropped in book four (no not the dead characters). Regrettably, I am sucked in. But I warn the reader of this review; may the others take you and the seven gods punish you if you think this book gets you any further through the blundering morass of a plot the author has chosen to make for us. First 2 books are great story telling-- 3 almost as good. The FOURTH creates a shambles of what was started. While I don't know the man, it is this kind of ""straying"" that leads me to believe he is more interested in the COIN than that of his story and the world he originally created. BEWARE with this book, R.R appears to have emerged our mad king!!! Take Heart!","2011-05-22","United States","","true","82","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMNX6VDEM26N8"
"B000FCKGPC","4","A soap opera in novel form","This series, while very entertaining is really a never ending story, in other words it's really a soap opera. There doesn't seem to be any conclusion to any of the events that are unfolding. The cast of characters are so large that it takes the equivalent of an entire chapter in the book just to tell who they are. The whole series of novels, to this point, are stories of betrayal, suspicion, fornication, jealousy, greed, pride and all the seven deadly sins. Every time a hero starts to emerge, the author finds ways to kill them off. We are left with a dead vengeful woman who hanged her most loyal follower, a young queen locked up in a prison with guards that know she is innocent of the crimes she is charged with by the greedy and power hungry queen regent, the queen regent imprisoned with some uncertain future, along with a crippled boy who is persusing a dream in the north that is not what he wanted. This is not to mention the bastard son of Ed Stark who is now Lord Commander of the Night Watch, with few men in black to carry out the tasks that seem to be looming ahead. Perhaps Lord Snow will end up being our hero. Who knows? The story is so interwoven with plots and subplots with so many characters, that the fifth novel has no way to bring a conclusion to the story. Look forward to a six and seventh novel in this series. This epic is approaching the ""Wheel of Time"" series by Robert Jordan for length. And you know what happened to him.","2013-01-09","United States","","true","83","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DVMOABB72AC5"
"B000FCKGPC","3","Hideous child of an awesome series.","This book kind of sucked. I hope that Martin still has something left because at this point he is ending books in a soap operatic fashion with crappy unfinished endings that leave the reader (watcher) on the edge of the couch. It is gimicky and reflects weak or unsure plot development and writing. Maybe he just wanted to stretch to more books for more money? I think it is pretty pathetic. Everyone was worried about him running down Jordan's path but it seems he found out how to turn something awesomely rich in detail, depth, action, and complexity into something complexly rich in putrescent useless filth. Anytime an author has to end or start a book with an explanation of why it does not deliver what is expected or wanted beware for the fountain pen tapping the cesspool (i.e.Dark Tower Series). Still entertaining writing and some surprises, but is it still surprising when the formula is: something or someone is good = almost certain death and destruction. Evil, cheating, lying = success! (yea) The formula is annoying when any gloriously huge pile of goodness is thwarted by a very simple monstrous act of evil. I know this is more realistic than most fantasy but how far does he need to stack the deck before the gloriously just? Daenyrys comes in to save the 7 Kingdoms? All my complaining without, I will ravenously devour each book he puts out , regardless how annoyingly he hooks me to read them. Complex characters, hidden secrets, and mostly rational action blah blah blah. So Martin has what most fantasy severly lacks. Everyone who has gotten this far has their own opinion and my drunken rantings will not change anything. But this was a 600 page book that could very likely just be skipped in the series. A voracious reader such as myself could not possible skip this book but if you are a casual reader and don't like Jordan's drawn out detail you can probably get away without reading this book at all. 600 pages of transition is a bit much. Martin thrives on having his characters do exaclty what the reader does not want them to do. Maybe he can actually produce another book, another piece to the story, without intentionally antogonizing the reader into reading more. It is hard to believe that the story presented to us is exactly what he wanted to write. Unless he naturally writes medieval fantasy identical to the writers of the crummy TV show Lost. I might actually give this a 2.5.","2006-11-13","United States","","true","84","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFGRST44NUD5D"
"B000FCKGPC","4","Slower paced but not bad","After the headlong excitement of bloodshed, intrigue, and snappy dialogue that we had in the first three books of the 'Song of Ice and Fire', 'A Feast for Crows' is quite a change. The plot slows down considerably, and not a lot seems to happen between the beginning and the end. This does not, however, ruin the book: on the contrary, though it is certainly the weakest link in the series so far, 'Feast' stands quite well on its own merits. For one thing, Martin's writing continues to be a pleasure to read. The dialogue is as snappy as ever and some chapters's climaxes had me on the edge of my seat, despite this volume's overall leisurely pacing. Which brings me to my next point: despite the complaints of those who were expecting another action-packed thriller from Martin's pen, I found the slow pace of 'Feast' not so much a fault as a ... well, a simple change of pace. After all, since Book 3 wrapped up the big old war, it just makes internal sense for not as much to be going on. Instead, in 'Feast for Crows' we are given a much deeper and fascinating look at the world that Martin has built this series around: and good heavens!, it is a rich one. This man has some incredible ideas, and puts them together with a deft instinct for unity and verisimilitude. Despite being a bridge book to fill the gap between Beginning and End, 'Feast for Crows' ably holds its own.","2008-08-28","United States","","true","85","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1A7NBS80YXZ23"
"B000FCKGPC","5","Like the novels, a review with a twist.....","I have to say this is the finest series I have ever read. For an intelligent, medevil soap opera it doesnt get any better. However...I am so beyond frustrated with the author. If he spent half the time he did writing in his ""not a blog"" or helping other authors, or whatever convention that month and focused on the novel maybe he wouldnt have so many fans irritated right now. At the end of this novel he states that Dance with dragons is almost done and blah blah blah. Well here we are 2+ years later and not even a release date to look forward to. Is he so arrogant that he thinks he fans wont desert him? Is he really not that devoted to his fans to give a crap about them? Why create an epic series to end all series and never finish it? At this rate the last book will be out in 2019. And unless he plans to live to be 90 and still writing it will never be done. I only hope that HBO wises up and options his other properties with a stipulation that he finishes the series. We could have 7 or 8 of the greatest movies, mini-series, or tv shows ever created if only someone could finish a novel. Yes I am venting and frustrated. I read the entire series every year as some sick ritual to hope that the next novel will come out. If your George RR Martin's editor, publicist, or publishing company reading this. Shame on you! Make your authors do some work. As for GRRM....I am sure you are a nice guy.

"B000FCKGPC","4","Secondary Characters Finally Get Their Own Book","I actually found this to be a more fascinating and bolder entry than the previous two books. Martin makes the daring choice to move the focus almost entirely on previously secondary characters, practically creating a whole new world with his description of Dorne alone, while major players like Dany and Tyrion are absent. But his gambit pays off: the globe-spanning cast of secondary characters created a sense of scale and paints a world in a state of change; the old guard of Westeros are dead and the survivors scramble for power, purpose, or survival. That said, the book's large and varied cast is also its weakness. The initial momentum from the initial scrambles in the new world order drops off towards the end, left incomplete for the next book. And unfortunately, Martin's skill at cohesion of disparate points of view is not as present as it was in previous entries. But still, it remains an intriguing entry in the series as a whole. One minor pet peeve though: for whatever reason, for POV chapters of secondary characters, instead of using the typical style of naming the chapter after the character's first name, like Aeron, he'll use some title like ""The Prophet"" (this is even more annoying when he'll then use a different title later). A minor, and not overly detracting, annoyance.","2017-09-23","United States","","true","87","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R305LBNAHEYGDY"

Unlike the first three, there's no monumentous event that ties things together. A lot of our favorites are absent, and in their place we get Sam the Fat and Brienne the Bore, and ten chapters of Cersai being stupid. Some signature troupes (such as cliffhangers and prophecies) are becoming overused, and there's an surprising retcon involving Viscerys that Martin probably just thought up at the spur of the moment. POV-wise, the Ironborn could have been reduced from 3 to 2, and Brienne has 9 friggin' chapters devoted to walking around and meeting random people. Kinda like Arya, only not as interesting. While I understand we need to be shown how Westeros has changed (and hasn't), 9 chapters with Brienne is a lot to ask. Especially when we know the journey is futile to begin with. But for all that, I didn't hate the book. The Dornish chapters are thematically strong with a diverse cast, and Euron Greyjoy has the potential to be an awesome villain (albeit not as contemptible as Viscerys or Joffrey, I really miss those little snot-nosed punks). Jaime's transformation from the height of arrogance to... only somewhat arrogant was well done, and keep me reading when the story bogged down. Overall AFFC delivers the goods, but in an atypically meandering and unfocused way.

Another brilliant remarkably written book and while not so easy to follow (what with the 400 or so new characters!!!!), this book 4 in the series of A Song of Ice & Fire is still a masterpiece on its own. I love LOVE this series and while book 4 was not as fast-paced action-packed page-turning as books 1,2 and especially 3, I loved it all the same. I must say that it helps tremendously to picture these characters from the tv series and to follow both the show and the books. Most readers whine about the tv series veering off in a different direction and not following the book scene by scene and while I wish it were exactly the same as the book, I realize that's just impossible. Don't forget that George RR Martin (GRMM) is heavily involved in the making of the series and even has written some of the tv scripts. And it's fun to see how well they do and what creative turns the tv show takes. I am learning to appreciate both ! My favorite parts of this book: Everything having anything to do with Dorne and the Dornish people. Least favorite: everything that happened with the Iron Islands. Biggest frustration: Where were Dany, Jon Snow, Tyrion and Davos? gRMM has a meek answer at the end of the book to that question. Overall, a solid 5 stars. I mean, hey it's GRMM, it's one of the greatest series on fantasy fiction ever written. It's fantastic. Delicious reading and beautifully complex characters in every chapter.

"B000FCKGPC","2","Tedious, very different from the first three","Let me start by pointing out what some might not know. This book is half of the book that GRRM intended to write. He took certain chapters from that book out to make this book and the rest will make up the next book. Unfortunately, what he really needed to do was get someone to edit the original book down instead. A Song of Ice and Fire is a series that is often layered in complexities, but so far the interesting stuff has come in such large doses that the complexity hasn't outweighed the interest factor. I'm sorry to say that this book is more complex than interesting. The amount of throwaway characters in the book is unwieldy. There are over fifty pages of lists of the various factions and their associated personages in the back of the book and I really did need those at times. There is a more narrow focus on the Westeros factions in this book with the Lannisters and Martells getting a lot of chapters. Many of these characters and their followers share similar names or even sometimes the same names and then GRRM mixes names with titles and it starts to get even more headache inducing. All this would probably have been forgiven if the majority of the book held my interest, but often I found myself skimming over the listings of bannermen, nobles or followers trying to keep moving along. Then there are the individuals we follow in this book. Jaime and Cersei Lannister get a large share of this book and they are just damned annoying. Jaime is screwed up over his hand being chopped off and his father dying and Cersei is just completely amoral and nuts as she takes over as Queen. Their inner dialogue often gets repetitive and predictable, especially Cersei. Brienne of Tarth also gets a large share of the book as she tries to search out Sansa Stark. The problem is that we know she isn't going to find Sansa where she is looking, so often it seems like her plotline is going nowhere. Sansa is still in the Eyrie with Littlefinger and not much happens there for most of the book. Arya is in Braavos and her chapters are some of the more interesting ones, but she doesn't make up for the various Greyjoy family members we have to follow around in the book. They just don't fill out as characters very well. They're too one-dimensional. Overall, there is a lot of plotting and maneuvering in this book and not much action. There were several plotlines that just felt like filler in this one, plotlines that could have been summed up in a few lines of dialogue somewhere else. I'm afraid the book just doesn't hold together as well as the past books. Except for Cersei and Jaime most of the characters never interact with each other, in turn the storylines feel very disconnected from each other. Here's hoping the second half of this novel works better.","2005-11-22","United States","","true","93","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R5BDXBFPVI9N"
"B000FCKGPC","2","Sad, but true","**spoilers ** What bothered me the most about the 4th entry in this series wasnt the absence of most of my favourite POV characters. I could live with that. What really grieves me is to watch a fine writer being doomed by some very serious writing syndromes. I'll try to explain some of them bellow. *The Titus Andronicus syndrome. Titus Andronicus is Shakespeare's worst play. It is a bad play because Shakespeare tries to ""shock and awe"" us with an arbitrary string of horrible things happening. However, what it really does is to bore us. Because it becomes predictable: whenever you come across a likeable character, you know something bad -- or something awful -- will happen to him or her. This syndrome of course was already present in the other books in this series, but in FFC Martin really succumbs. Were you eager to know what happened to the Hound? Well, he's dead. Did you come to like Brienne even if her POVs are infinitely dull? Well, she gets half of her face chewed off and then she is hanged. Was Davos Seaworth one of the nicest guys in Westeros? Well, now you learn he is (problably) dead and had his hands and feet hacked off. And we all know Tyrion lost his nose, Jaime lost his sword hand and Catelyn became a zombie. I'm not saying that bad things should'nt happen to characters I like; I'm just saying that, after a while, it ceases to be ""bold"" and ""realistic"" and it becomes just another predictable cliche. * The Robert Jordan syndrome. Robert Jordan could write hundreds of pages without advancing the plot even a little bit; he seemed to think that anything happening to this or that character was worth telling. So he tells us how someone went to some inn, how he or she wandered about the common room, then went outside to breath some fresh air, then got to the common room once again, then sipped some beer, then went outside, then came back to the inn, then went to his or her room and slept, then woke up and... well, you got it. His books got too long and he never finished his series. *The James Clavell syndrome. Except for Shogun, almost all of James Clavell's books are packed with legions of useless, superficial and underdeveloped characters, that simply get in and out of the main action without leaving any remarkable mark upon our memories. That's what happens with most character in the ironborn and dorne subplots. I actually liked the action in the ironborn subplot; I just cant understand why it had to be told through three different POVs. The thing gets even worst with the dornish; for me the Hootah and the Oakheart chapters are a mistery. They are simply useless. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of those new POVs characters, although I found the plot itself interesting at times. All that said, I must add that I did enjoy Jaime's chapters. Hopefully, all those flaws will be mended in the next volume. I still trust Martin's extraordinary talent as a storyteller. He wont disapoint us in the end, I'm sure.","2011-03-23","United States","","true","94","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16M9KP2U9OP0H"

To justify its length the details have to be interesting, and this is done in two ways: vivid characters and surprising but fitting twists of plot; but that means complexity. Complexity requires hard work for the understanding and the memory, for which work naturally there must be some reward: why take all the trouble to keep all these events and characters straight in your mind? Unless of course you love them and love the story as a whole, but what you love should be worthy of that love: else it must fail and fade. There's only one element in a good book to justify love for its characters and plot, in fiction especially, where these are not real: what can that justification be but the book's theme? Theme determines the conclusion because it's the necessary end to both characters and plot, their destination. How many otherwise good books fail because they have a bad ending; or worse, they have no ending at all? Isn't this the danger the saga now after four books runs? Will the fifth book provide the obligatory happy or at least satisfactory ending? Will patience be rewarded? After so promising a beginning and so long, not to say tedious, a middle, will we at the end be able to say, That was well done! Four stars then I say, with the fifth in abeyance.","2011-06-05","United States","","true","98","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZ16O3RKXVPX6"
"B000FCKGPC","4","Small book but nice fit. Just read it.","I bought the fourth book after finishing off the previous three fairly quickly. I thought I was getting the medium sized paperback when I ordered based on the dimensions but it ended up being the small paperback. Seller probably needs to update those dimensions. I was almost thinking about sending it back when I decided to jump in and start reading. The small size had a strange feel at first but then as I got used to it, I appreciated how light weight the book felt. I'm about 500 pages in so I'll give a quick review of A Feast for Crows with no spoilers. George R R Martin changed his chapter titles for this book. In the past the characters name was the chapter title. This book still will use characters names occasionally but more often he uses a description (The Kraken's Daughter). Odd choice to change up the chapter titles so late into a series. This book focuses very closely on two regions of Westeros: The Iron Isles and Dorne. The other books were all over the map but since this one is more focused, you really getting a better feel for those two areas of Westeros. It seems that the culture and people really come to life since you aren't jumping all over. Definitely pick it up if you're a fan of the series. Make sure you've read the previous three first!","2013-03-22","United States","","true","99","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZC179A4NV2RH"
